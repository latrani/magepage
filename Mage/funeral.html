   Funeral in Suburbia
  </h1>

   It is embarrassingly obvious that the priest never knew him;
  he is spouting a conventional elegy for "a loving husband and
  father, a warm friend and popular co-worker...". At least once he
  mispronounced the name without noticing. I look around at the
  small group of people standing around the grave, shivering
  slightly in the cold autumn breeze. His family stands huddled on
  the opposite side, his daughter (wasn't her name Tina or
  something?) holds her mother's hand and cries constantly, her
  brother stands a little bit apart, staring fixedly into the
  grave. Beside them, the priest and a little old lady who might be
  a relation, its just our team present. He didn't have that many
  friends.

   A cloud briefly hides the cold sun, as the priest finally
  intones "dust to dust...". Beyond the cemetery suburbia still
  shines, flecked with slowly gliding cloud-shadows. I know they
  are out there somewhere. Perhaps they sit celebrating in some
  den, laughing at the memory of how Jack killed the Man in Black
  with that freaky entropy effect. One small step towards
  Ascension.

   After the ceremony I walk up to his wife, saying something
  comforting and conventional, I don't know what. She looks
  collected, but I see through her frail mask. I wish I could tell
  her what her husband really died for, the great vision, the Big
  Picture, but I cannot. She would not understand, and I'm not sure
  I know myself. I glance towards the flowers where one wreath
  stands out. It is shaped like a double moebius strip, the ribbon
  bearing the words "One world. One truth. One reality".
