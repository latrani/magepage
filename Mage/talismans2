Hi all. Well, on a break from my Grail studies <sigh...> I wrote up these
little dandies. Enjoy.

Candles of the Midnight Vigil
-----------------------------
        These are 5 talismans created by a Celestial Chorus/Order of
Hermes team. They are used in conjunction with circles to strengthen
magick against different creatures/spirits.

Box of Lead
-----------
        This box is made of wood with metal corners and coverings, all
detailed with intricate metal/woodwork. The box has dimensions of a
medium-sized jewelry box (10 cm high/25 cm wide/15 cm long). Anything
placed inside (up to three items the size of a two-litre bottle) can be
stored there (correspondence effect). The box prevents the sensing of
whatever is placed inside of it (including magick items/talismans/fetishes;
it is not known whether it will work for artifacts). However, any magickal
items placed inside of it must yield one point of Quintessence each, or
the mage must provide the point of Quint. If the Quintessence is not
provided, then the box is just an ordinary box.

Book of Dreamer's Delight
--------------------------
        This book will yield information on a subject of the possesor's
wish (Research + Enigmas/2 + Int; Diff. dependent on subject; successes
dependent on extent of information). However, the information has a
price. The book requires a steady source of Quintessence to continue to
be used. Also, the book can only be consulted on a singular subject each
day (much like the Dream background). The book can provide 5 study points
per week of study.

        The book possesses all spheres at level 1 (or higher where necessary)

Well, I hope you enjoy them and can use them. I am almost ready present
my research on the Grail. Hopefully it will include some neat historical
tidbits and some hooks for storylines. Til then!
