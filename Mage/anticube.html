   The Anticube and Alhambra Foundation

   Most mages curse the forces of Paradox, but they have to
  acknowledge that they also protect reality from the Things
  Beyond. And at least once Paradox has defeated one of the major
  Things.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the winter 1872 in Darmstadt, a group of hermetic
  barrabbi led by the infamous Nephandus Samuel K. Reuss (who had
  singlehandedly defeated and slowly killed over 50 inquisitors and
  hunters sent by the Traditions, Church and Technocracy) attempted
  a major ritual to open a rift through the worlds to their lord,
  an unnamed Thing from beyond the Abyss. They had gained access to
  a powerful node, and with them they had the remains of several
  soldiers killed in the war on significant ley-lines; the barrabbi
  planned to use them as sympathetic links to drain several remote
  nodes and sacrifice their souls.
  </p>
  <p>
   The ritual backfired. A rift opened, but the powerful web of
  Entropy, Prime, Correspondence and Spirit became unstable in the
  presence of the Thing. For a moment, the entire town of Darmstadt
  hung between the physical world and the abyss, where the darkness
  moved to devour its faint light. But then static reality snapped
  into place and sealed the rift with tremendous force. The
  backlash wrinkled time and space around the wounded part of
  reality, sealing it off and imploding it like a black hole. The
  building where the ritual took place and all its inhabitants -
  human and otherwise - were totally destroyed as Paradox met the
  Beyond. And the Nephandi Lord was caught in the maelstrom.
  </p>
  <p>
   When a cabal of mages arrived at the place a few hours latter,
  led by the intense fluctuations in the quintessence fields they
  found what they called the anticube. It was a small thing, around
  a decimetre across but strangely warped - it looked like a cube,
  but seen from the inside! It had no color or other properties,
  but seemed to reflect them from the surroundings in some odd way.
  This paradoxical object appears to be a permanent flaw in the
  fabric of reality; its walls are made of imploded paradox and
  quintessence trapped by an insoluble conflict.
  </p>
  <p>
   Inside (if that has any meaning for an inside-out object) a
  major Nephandi Lord is trapped. Its sudden absence was felt
  across the world by many dark mages, and several K'hallassa
  independently destroyed themselves with fire and water. It took
  some more time before the Traditions realised what had happened,
  but eventually the cabal that had found and taken the anticube
  understood what they were carrying with them. Horrified they
  sought out the Masters of the traditions for advice.
  </p>
  <p>
   It soon became clear that the force that held the Lord
  imprisoned was Paradox. If the anticube was removed from static
  reality its walls might weaken; to keep it safe it had to be
  located in strongly normal reality. And so the Alhambra
  Foundation was created to safeguard the anticube and prevent the
  release of its contents.
  </p>
  <p>
   Alhambra Foundation originally consisted of the mages who
  found the anticube, but in time other mages joined as the old
  left. At first the anticube was kept in a small apartment in
  Geneva. During the second World War the Foundation feared that
  the Nephandi would find it and contacted the Technocracy; they
  invited it to help them keep the anticube under lock and key. The
  Technocracy accepted and took over. They moved the Foundation to
  ZÃ¼rich, where they gave it a new home in an extremely
  anonymous office building.
  </p>
  <p>
   But the first technocratic chairman of the Foundation made the
  former members a surprising offer: in the interest of keeping
  reality stable and secure, the Foundation would accept help from
  Tradition mages. If a traditionalist came upon some kind of
  artefact that threatened reality, he or she could give it to the
  Foundation with no fear of the Pogrom. Although many tradition
  mages remain sceptical of the offer, and several hardliners
  within the Technocracy have argued that it is almost treason, the
  Foundation still keeps this policy.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the post-war years the Foundation started to gather other
  dangerous artefacts to keep them out of the hands of Nephandi,
  Marauders or other dangerous groups. In several highly protected
  caches in Switzerland the Foundation kept objects that might
  undermine reality but could not be destroyed. The caches are
  today surrounded by powerful Paradox Zones, technomagickal wards
  and mundane security.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to the original Nephandi and Marauder artefacts,
  the Technocracy sometimes use the Foundation to keep other things
  they do not want but cannot destroy. This has given rise to the
  persistent rumors about "Hangar 13" where everything from the Ark
  of the Covenant to the immortal lighbulb are kept. The truth is a
  bit more practical, most of the caches consist of sealed steel or
  primium boxes marked by bar-codes, in concrete-walled rooms with
  electronic surveillance active at all times and massive primium
  bulkheads.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Foundation is organised as a small democratic group, led
  by a chairman (currently Vito Tagliaferri of the Void Engineers)
  and seven other technomancers. Each runs a different section,
  ranging from the five containment sections that keep the
  artefacts to R&amp;D and defence. They have quite extensive
  resources, divided in independent cells (in the case one part was
  lost to the Nephandi). In the past most of the work has been to
  keep control over the collections, but recently the amount of
  Nephandi activity has increased and security is becoming a major
  concern.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the Ascension War, the Foundation stands as one of the few
  (overt) examples of collaboration between the Traditions and
  Technocracy. There is little doubt that many Nephandi would
  willingly give their lives to get the Anticube and move it into
  the Umbra in the hope of releasing the Lord.
