Hmm, let me see... What about this?

Survival - the mage feels a need to survive. Many mages never progress beyond
this level, being fearful of their powers and the dark would outside normal
reality.

Power - the mage begins to seek to master his magick, and wants to use it 
to satisfy his lesser needs. Many mages overdo this, and become trapped in
the power stage as they become more and more powerful.

Understanding - the mage feels the need to understand reality and/or himself.
This transcends mere power for power's sake, but can become understanding
for understanding's sake. 

Growth - the mage feels the calling towards Ascension, and seeks personal
and spiritual growth. The mage will be forced to seek the Path regardless
of outside influences, hinders or restrictions, often eventually breaking 
away from his tradition. 

Enlightenment - the mage needs the mystical experience, to transcend his
Awakened state into a brief glimpse of Ascension (this is what happens
in epiphanies and great visions). But many mages become trapped in this,
as they blissfully watch Ascension instead of achieving it. 

Unity -  the mage needs to unite all aspects of himself and the universe;
self and otherself, truth and lies, matter and mind, Quintessence and
Paradox. There is a great risk that the mage looses his balance in this
process and destroys himself.

Transcendence - the mage needs to transcend everything - existence, his
ego, Ascension itself.
