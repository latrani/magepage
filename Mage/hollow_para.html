  <h1>
   Hollow Ones Paradigm
  </h1>
  <h2>
   by Malcus Dorroga

  <p>
   <strong>
    Note to Readers:
   </strong>
   While I have seen many
  variations on the Hollow Ones' paradigm, most fail to explain the
  overall worldview of the Hollow Ones themselves. Despite the fact
  that many are rather young and are apt to have VERY materialistic
  and selfish ideas, the very fact that they have Awakened avatars
  indicates having some kind of overall worldview, some idea about
  what existence is. From what I have read, especially
   <em>
    The Book
  of Shadows
   </em>
   , the Hollow Ones are linked by a very existential
  worldview. My hope with the following is to reconcile this
  philosophy with the Hollow One's Gothic lifestyle.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    The Paradigm - Nothingness:
   </strong>
   This world is a
  great Void. There is no Way of things, no ultimate uniting Song,
  just a huge Void. There is no meaning in this Void, no higher
  purpose to Being, just a Void. Things exist, and the ants scurry
  around every day trying to justify it all, but there is no real
  reason why we do it.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Magick - Desire:
   </strong>
   Those with the proper
  disposition can project their desires into the Void and impose
  their own meaning on reality for a short time. This is where the
  fun begins!
  </p>
  <h3>
   <strong>
    THE SPHERES
   </strong>
  </h3>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Correspondence - Unspace:
   </strong>
   Isn't is nice how
  everything has it's place? Space is simply a way for the ants to
  simplify the Void, a trick of denial. Find the Unspace, the
  single infinity where the Void exists, and then learn how to skip
  rush hour!
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Entropy - Decay:
   </strong>
   At some point, everything
  just goes to pot. It means nothing; it's simply that the Void
  cannot hold everything, and so stuff gets wrecked to make room
  for new toys. Decay hits everything, including the ants' nice
  prepakaged beliefs, which is why they don't like it.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Forces - Power:
   </strong>
   This is the stuff that keeps
  the Void running properly. Divert a bit of it and watch everyone
  scream!
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Life - Being:
   </strong>
   This seems to screw everyone up;
  just because we exist, there is some sort of meaning to it all?
  Get real, ants! Watch me play with your Being, then tell me that
  it's so special! I mean, it's cool to be, but to be does not mean
  that you be something.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Matter - Existence:
   </strong>
   Stuff exists, plain and
  simple. Why? Who knows and, frankly, WHO CARES! Just play with
  existence and see what kind of pretty toys you can make.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Mind - Pattern:
   </strong>
   Thoughts impose pattern on the
  Void, trying to make sense of the utterly senseless. Play with
  the ants' thoughts, screw up their pretty patterns, and watch 'em
  go nuts.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Prime - Essence:
   </strong>
   Think of it as Universal
  Super Glue... hey, something's gotta hold all this crap together!
  It keeps Existence from falling apart too quickly, keeps the
  Power running, and keeps the ants breathing.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Spirit - Reflections:
   </strong>
   There is a place where
  the truth about the Void is revealed, and something lives there!
  Spirits reflect the light and dark of the reality the ants are
  desperately trying to create, and show us what can happen when
  you deny the truth of the Void for too long.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Time - Measure:
   </strong>
   Just another cutsey and
  creation to make Being easier. By measuring the length between
  events, the ants justify ideas like elders, history, and
  importance. Time is just another measurement, and the hands of my
  watch turn back just as easily as the ruler can be shifted.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Arete - Acceptance:
   </strong>
   The more one accepts the
  meaningless of the Void, the more one can screw with it. If you
  can accept the Nothingness in Being, in Existence, and in
  yourself, you grow in presence and, in a weird way, become more
  real. Why this happens is unknown, but it may be that, as you
  accept your Nothingness, you lift the veil of ignorance and
  connect with the Void more directly. Who knows; just accept
  futility and have fun!
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Quintessence - Support:
   </strong>
   Those accept the Void
  usually receive support from it in some way, usually in the form
  of fuel for your Desires. Cool stuff; don't pass it up!
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Paradox - Revenge:
   </strong>
   Just like you and I don't
  like other people's ideas imposed on us, the Void doesn't like it
  when you impose too much meaning on it. When you do that, and
  ESPECIALLY when you're blatant about it, the Void strikes back
  and takes revenge.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Mage-Related Backgrounds
  </h3>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Arcane - Nonexistence:
   </strong>
   Sometimes you accept
  your Nothingness so much that you become harder to perceive.
  Let's face it, if you mean nothing and KNOW it, then the ants are
  going to have a hard time finding a way to justify your
  existence.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Avatar - Presence:
   </strong>
   There is a part of you that
  is intimiately connected with the Void and helps you out. It is
  this Presence that allowed you to perceive the truth, and it is
  this Presence that will see you to the final truth.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Chantry - Hideout:
   </strong>
   When the ants just get on
  your nerves, you need to find a place where everyone knows your
  name.....
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Destiny - Ego:
   </strong>
   We all know this guy, usually
  the dumb jock or Little-Miss-My- Shyte-Don't-Stink. They have the
  biggest egos in the world, and nothing can seem to bring it down.
  Odd thing is that sometimes that ego is justified, and odd stuff
  starts to happen.......
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Dream - Guidance:
   </strong>
   Once in a while, your
  Presence needs to tell you something important, so it talks to
  you when it has your full attention.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Node - Battery:
   </strong>
   Essence tends to collect in
  nifty little batteries that you can pick up and pop into your
  Desires. Of course, you aren't the only one that likes these
  little batteries, so watch your back.
