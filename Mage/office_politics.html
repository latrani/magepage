   Office Politics

  There is a reason why the technocracy hasn't smashed
  us all. And it isn't because were the good guys. It isn't because
  they are incompetent. It isn't because they are being eaten from
  the inside by Nephandi rot.(odds are fairly good that they don't
  have any more barrabi than the traditions do.)
  <p>
   It's because they are people. Just like us. Tradition mages
  tend to see the Technocracy as a large monolithic entity that
  comes down on them like the hammer of god. Marauders see them as
  a big case of Constipation begging for an enema. Nephandi see
  them as a bear maddened by rabies. Dangerous,but eventually going
  to fall.
  </p>
  <p>
   They are none of these things. In order to understand the
  enemy, you must stop demonizing him and see him for what he
  really is. People...
  </p>
  <h2>
   Interconvention rivalries
  </h2>
  This is the type of struggle
  that is the most common and thus is one that all technocrats
  expect and deal with best. Everybody knows that everybody spies
  for everybody else. and this creates a very real "Trust no one."
  kind of atmosphere. N.W.O spies on people to make sure that union
  orthodoxy is observed, Iterators spy on others to increase their
  efficiency and to determine whether or not they should be
  liquidated when the time comes. Progenitors and Syndicate spy on
  other mainly to protect their own interest. and the Void
  Engineers spy on others just to makes sure that they aren't being
  effectively spied on.
  <p>
   In multi-convention amalgams it is usually taken as an article
  of faith that everything that happens is reported back to ones
  superiors. This can occasionally hamper operational effectiveness
  when each member of said cabal has their own agenda. (please note
  that i have just made an understatement on par with "hitler
  dabbled in real estate". You want an idea of how a
  multi-convention amalgam is going to operate? Go buy a copy of
  Paranoia. those of you who have know what i'm talking about.)

  <h2>
   The Peter Principle
  </h2>
  Formulated by Lawrence J. Peter
  basicly breaks down into this one simple axiom.
  <blockquote>
   " A manager will inevitably be promoted past the level of his
    own competence."
  </blockquote>
  ( i hope i'm not mis-quoting this.)
  <p>
   What this means is that there is a very good chance that the
  person who is issuing orders to you has no real idea of what he's
  doing or what it's like out in the field.
  </p>
  <p>
   What do you do when the captian of the vessel freaks out in
  the face of danger? What do you do when the Time-motion managers
  give you an impossible task that has to be completed in an
  impossible amount of time? What do you do when the boss orders
  you to market unsellable merchandise? What do you do when the
  head of the lab is so consumed by his own research that nobody
  can get a chance to talk to him about funding for their own
  projects? What do you do when the Men in white order you to
  infiltrate doissetep?
  </p>
  <p>
   I'll tell you what you do. You act against orders or without
  them and pray god that you succeed. Hell ,even if you do succeed
  you may get chewed out and marked as a troublemaker by your
  incompetent boss. And you can be sure of this. No matter how
  messed up or oblivious an incompetent manager is, they allways
  have an unerring sense of people who could take their job away
  from them.

  <h2>
   Who's Really in charge?
  </h2>
  It would appear that the N.W.O
  are. Simply by virtue of them being the ones that create
  assignments. While the various conventions have no difficulty
  assigning things to their underlings it is usually the N.W.O.
  that is able to say "We need an amalgam to do this... and these
  are our requirements." N.W.O. matches amalgams up by psych
  profiles and work expirience and the browbeats the other
  conventions when necessary for personnel.
  <p>
   Whether they get those particular personnel or not is a
  different matter.Anything even remotely interesting will require
  someone to spy on it. But sometimes it's hard for the N.W.O.
  mages to fill slots with the right people if it is perceived as
  some kind of shit detail or suicide job. Other conventions have
  no intention of sacrificing their best and brightest on the altar
  of Order mage arrogance.

  <h2>
   Decision power
  </h2>
  The levels of bureacracy in the Union
  often paralyze their effectiveness especially in cases where an
  unusual situation occurs.( please not that I have just made an
  understatement on par with "Traffic Court is unfair.") Many
  times,when someone in the field reports on a situation, that
  report is sent to an officer ,who sends it to an analyst, who
  puts it together with all the known information on that subject.
  This report is often sent to a committee to be summarized and to
  suggest courses of action,(read: distort the intel for personal
  gain and further own agenda) whereupon the information finally
  reaches someone who can actually make a decision about it. This
  person is usually someone who rarely leaves the office and is so
  far removed from the action that they really have no referent in
  making the decision. Usually, by this time, the situation has
  blossomed into a full grown catastrophe and the on-site people
  get yelled at because they couldn't move for all the buck
  passing.("why in the hell didn't you DO something?")
  <p>
   Sound unlikely? It is the way the every intelligence gathering
  arm of the united states government operates. Why should the Void
  engineers,N.W.O or the Syndicate operate any different. The only
  exceptions to this rule are the progenitors(who operate under a
  different model) and the Iteration X (who contact the Computer
  directly.)
  </p>
  <h2>
   Laziness,Petty squabling and micromanagement
  </h2>
  Doing a
  job,any job,can be a real pain in the ass. Some react to it in
  different ways. Some do the absolute minimum required to stay on
  top of the job.(a common malady among mid-level bureacrats and
  people who do a lot of the scut work.) Some engage in pointless
  political games.( a common problem in the Order,Syndicate,and
  Progenitors) and some overmanage every single detail of a
  particular task or mission to the point of causing it to fail.(
  Iteration X has a serious problem with this at times. " Yes I
  realize that the body armor is bulkier than you are used to but
  it provides the same level of protection as the old armor and
  costs less." )
  <h2>
   Powerblocs and Power struggles
  </h2>
  This is not to say that
  the Technocracy is entirely ineffectual. Often, internal
  powerblocs form around charismatic individuals who have good
  records and high success rate. These thing tend to rise and fall
  like mini empires and sometimes result in situations where a
  group is left alone to pursue its own agenda because the leader
  is either politically or personally powerfull enough to make sure
  that enemies leave him alone. Inevitably these groups clash with
  one another over ideology, limited resources,or simple
  aggression. Unfortunately, Tradition mages tend to caught in the
  middle of these things too. Sometimes these groups fracture
  because the Union steps in as a whole and puts a stop to their
  activities, sometimes they fracture from within because of a
  schism in the ranks.(the second in command starts to think that
  the leader has turned away from his original vision or worse,
  sold out.) and sometimes these groups are simply destroyed in
  bureacratic combat. While they live though they are a very real
  danger to Tradition mages because they tend to mesh very well and
  they thrive on success. Which means they are ambitious.
  <h2>
   Sexual politics
  </h2>
  This is becoming an increasingly touchy
  problem in recent years. its allways been around but nobody ever
  talked about it. Iteration X swears that it doesn't exist in
  their ranks. but it does. it exists in any place where you have
  people dealing with one another. What do you do if you have a
  boss who is sexually harassing you and he/she also happens to
  have the ability to warp reality? What do you do when some young
  incompetent is promoted over you just because he/she is sleeping
  with the boss. What do you do if you have an active libido and
  belong to Iteration X (Sex drive is considered an undesirable
  aberation. uneccessary.) What do you do if you are gay or
  bisexual and belong the N.W.O? What do you do when you are a high
  ranking Syndicate mage and you caught on tape being tied up and
  spanked by the "Mistress."? What do you do when you are a Void
  Engineer and you are stuck out in space for long periods of time
  without any sexual release? Or Worse....
  <p>
   What if you fall in love? Suppose you fall for someone in your
  own amalgam and your operational efficiency goes down because you
  are allways trying to protect them. Suppose they hurt you, or
  betray you, or get killed on you.
  </p>
  <p>
   What in the hell are you going to do when you fall in love
  with a member of the opposite camp, or even fall for one of the
  nephandi?
  </p>
  <p>
   Love and Sex are not expressly forbidden by the technocracy.
  but they might as well be.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Iniquitous practices
  </h2>
  Like say featherbedding, Where the
  Syndicate mage who is funding the project manages to pry a chunk
  of cash loose from Disbursements and then pockets a good bit of
  it before turning it over to the team.
  <p>
   Like say Nepotism, favoritism,or even discrimination, any
  practice of management that puts incompetent people over others
  with the same or more merit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Like maybe Favor brokering, a practice that is severly frowned
  on by the Union at large but still persists.(important tip, never
  attempt this with Iterators. you can't tell whether they'll pay
  up or not when you really need it.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Like Credit stealing, which happens in every branch of the
  technocracy and often leads to aggression in workplace and even
  sabotage.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Pressure
  </h2>
  Keeping reality safe is full time job and
  requires eternal vigilance and attention to duty.
  <p>
   There is only one problem with this. Humans aren't built for
  eternal vigilance and attention to duty. The Technocracy as a
  whole is a pressure cooker and worse, refuses to admit that it's
  own ethic is what is killing it. Alcoholism and Sadomasochism
  runs rampant in all strata of the N.W.O and the Syndicate. Sexual
  harassment is becoming an increasing problem (as noted above).
  Void engineers sometimes turn to suicide as a way out the
  boredom, Progenitors seem to have less problems with this but
  even they are not immune. And while Iterators seem to be
  untouched by these rigors, it has been noted that the incidence
  of job related psychoses is slowly but steadily trending
  upward.
  </p>
  <p>
   This lack of release is the factor that leads more Technocrats
  to Renunciation than any other. These weaknesses that we all
  possess are easiest to exploit when repressed to the point of
  creating a crises. Technocrats with these problems either
  sublimate their problem into increased dedication or they feel
  trapped and want to gnaw their own leg off to escape.
  </p>
  <h2>
   So what does it all mean, Reverend?
  </h2>
  It means that a
  Technocratic Construct is as rife for intrigue as doissetep keep
  or a city full of Vampires.This should be reflected at the
  Amalgam level. The only groups that aren't going to have any
  difficulty with internecine strife are groups of MIB constructs
  and Hit-marks. And this is because they are people with
  problems... just like us.
