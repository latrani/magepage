   Akashic Brotherhood Paradigm
  </h1>
  <h5>
   By Tetsu

  <hr>
   Note: As much as possible, I have used Western terms to describe
  Eastern concepts. When this is not possible, I have tried to
  include both Japanese and Chinese terminology. These concepts are
  found in most Eastern societies, and I apologize for my lack of
  familiarity with the terminology of the other major Eastern
  cultures. The Mage books, by the way, are heavily biased towards
  Japanese terminology (as am I), despite the fact that the
  Japanese did not develop many of these concepts until far after
  the mainland peoples did (in fact, many of the concepts were
  imported). Even Do is a Japanese term meaning "The Way." If the
  Akashic Brotherhood really is as old as they seem, a reasonable
  explanation for their use of terminology must be the more recent
  refinements (1500 AD to present) to martial arts that the
  Japanese have introduced. This would imply an evolution of the
  Paradigm to its present form.
   <h2>
    The Paradigm
   </h2>
   <b>
    The Way
   </b>
   : There are things, and there
  is a Way to all things. There is a way to paint and a Way to
  paint; there is a way to shoot an arrow and a Way to shoot an
  arrow. There is a way to move and a Way to move; your training in
  Do teaches you part of the Way of moving, as well as the Way of
  fighting. Do is much more than this, but you must understand the
  existence of the Way before you can proceed on the Path.
   <p>
    The Way of doing a thing is to do it correctly, so that mind,
  body, and spirit are one and focused on the achievement of the
  goal. Masters live their chosen Way at all times, whether it is
  the Way of painting, shooting and arrow, or Do.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Magick
   </h2>
   <b>
    The Way of Do - Focus
   </b>
   : This Way is not
  magick, though many will call it that. A student of Do is a
  gifted martial artist with a natural or developed ability to
  achieve a Way of Being of high order. Mind, body, and spirit are
  in harmony with each other and the universe, and when this is so,
  a person is capable of great achievement: to leap great
  distances, to anticipate others as if reading their thoughts, to
  sunder unbreakable objects, and many other feats. Nothing is
  impossible to the Way as long as you accept it can be done and
  Focus on achieving the goal.
   <p>
    <b>
     The Way of Sorcery - Magick
    </b>
    : There are many other
  people, on this world and others, who can achieve great acts but
  do not follow our Way. These others practice Sorcery and Magick.
  Their Ways are different and many. Do not close your mind to the
  many possibilities.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Spheres
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <b>
      Correspondence: Distance
     </b>
     : The greatest secret of
    succeeding in combat is the control of distance and space. If
    you fight barehanded, stay beyond the distance of your
    opponents longest weapon, the leg. If you fight with weapons,
    stay beyond their length. If you fight with guns, stay beyond
    their range. If you fight with armies, the control of paths and
    territories is essential. Do not the games of Go and Chess
    teach us this, to force the opponent to commit to territory
    they cannot adequately defend or control? People of great
    ability have such a great mastery and control of Distance that
    they can seem to traverse it in an instant.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Entropy: Weakness
     </b>
     : Nothing on this world is perfect,
      including yourself. You must strive to purge yourself of all
      weakness. When you do so, you will achieve Enlightenment.
      Others will try to take advantage of the Weakness of a thing.
     <p>
      <b>
       Karma, Joss
      </b>
      : Fate, in this world, cannot be counted
      upon, but it can be influenced.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Forces, Matter: The Elements
     </b>
     : The Ancients believed
    the world to be made of five elements: Earth, Fire, Water,
    Wind, and Void. You can harness the power of the Elements in
    your life as you walk the Path. Know the sun and the moon.
    Study the Way of the storm. Meditate by the ocean, and listen
    to the power of the waves. You can harness this power with good
    Focus.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Life: Body
     </b>
     : All living things have a body, the
    plants, the animals, the trees, and the people. When you
    understand the body of a thing you understand its life--how it
    can move and how it cannot move, how it can be hurt and how it
    can be healed.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Mind:
     </b>
     This is the seat of the conscious and
    unconscious. It is the source of Focus and of Will. You must
    rigorously train your mind to Focus better. If you understand
    the minds of others, you can glimpse their Way. Profound
    understanding leads to profound ability; this is why you must
    study and train always.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Prime: Ki, Chi
     </b>
     : There is a flow to all things, a
    cycle of living and dying, of breathing in and out, of yin and
    yang, in and yo. Binding this cycle and flowing through it is
    Ki. Ki is energy, and it is much more. You must learn to sense
    the flow of Ki within yourself, and through it the world. This
    is essential to learning Do and to mastering the Elements. By
    learning to master Ki you will be able to harness the powers in
    you and the powers of the universe.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Spirit:
     </b>
     The study of Spirit is the study of emotion
    and inner essence. As you learn about yourself through the
    trials of Do, you will become aware of your own potential, and
    the potential of the universe. There are spirit realms beyond
    our world inhabited by our ancestors, kami, demons, and more.
    To learn of the spirit worlds is a difficult undertaking, for
    there is much to learn. Spirits can be helpful or vindictive,
    good or evil or something in between. You will encounter them
    in your travels; the more you know of them, the better you will
    be able to come away from your encounters with wisdom and not
    injury. The world of the spirits is reflected within you.
    Meditate upon this now.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Time:
     </b>
     Our concept of Time is not the same as the
    Westerners see it. To them Time is a measurable thing, to be
    broken down into units and more smaller units to regulate their
    lives. This way has no meaning, and is futile. Time is infinite
    and forever. How can you devide the infinite? Time is like a
    flowing river: it always passes by, sometimes faster, sometimes
    slower. You must learn to see the river, the whole river in its
    entirety. When you can grasp all of time you can control how
    you think of it. You can slow it down so that you can act
    faster. You can glimpse the past, and the possibilities of the
    future. The master of Time can even move beyond it...
    </li>
   </ul>

   <b>
    The Path
   </b>
   : Each member of the Akashic
  Brotherhood has set themselves upon a path of knowledge and self
  discovery. On this path each will learn much about themselves,
  others, and the world. Progress on the path is measured by the
  amount of harmony between mind, body and spirit. At the end of
  the path lies Enlightenment.
   <p>
    Skill in Do is not the Path, it is only a part, a tool used by
  masters to teach certain skills to the Disciples. Physical
  prowess is easily learned and mastered with practice. Much harder
  to bring into harmony are the sicknesses of the mind and the
  power of the spirit. Masters of Do are generally equally matched
  physically; it is the more subtle development of Willpower, guile
  (Wits), and Intelligence that will determine the outcome of any
  contest.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Quintessence
   </h2>
   <b>
    Ki, Chi
   </b>
   : The force that flows
  through and binds the universe can be channeled with the proper
  Focus. This is why you must learn to sense Ki within yourself and
  in the world. In the world you will find places where the flow is
  very strong, and even the springs from which this flow comes.
  These are places of great importance in the world. You should
  take time to meditate in places such as these. This will greatly
  help you to Focus.
   <h2>
    Paradox
   </h2>
   <b>
    Incorrect action
   </b>
   : if an action is taken
  with improper Focus, there is the possibility of error. To make
  an error is a Weakness, and Weakness opens up oneself to the
  consequences of their incorrect action. Sometimes an opponent
  will take advantage of the opportunity. Perhaps the universe will
  attempt to deny your success and you will accumulate Bad Karma.
  Ultimately, it is your failure that will allow others to harm
  you. Do not fail!
   <h2>
    Ascension
   </h2>
   <b>
    Enlightenment
   </b>
   : This is the goal of your
  studies, the total harmony of body, mind, and spirit. When you
  have achieved Enlightenment, you will have mastered the Way. You
  will truly understand who and what you are, and your place in the
  scheme of things. It is said that the Masters are capable of
  great feats. It is also said that the Masters have achieved a
  great sense of peace, of harmony with all things. This is the
  goal of Do, and of the Way.
