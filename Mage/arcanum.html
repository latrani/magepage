    I don't know if anyone else is interested in this, but here is
  a background I wrote for the Arcanum in London. I use them quite
  a lot, and I wanted to give them some background that went back
  more than 100 years. Sorry for spamming you all :-)

     Any comments, etc, welcomed.

        A Brief History

      <p>
       The first organised investigative work into the occult in the
  UK was probably begun with the early incursions of the Xtian
  church. The library at Hampstead still has copies of letters
  written from the Abbot of Lindisfarne to his opposite number in
  Ashby-de-la-Zouche in discussion of how a local nun had driven a
  spirit away from a bridge seemingly by power of faith. The letter
  had been dated by Arcanum scholars at the early 1200's and is
  thought to be one of the earliest records of activities by the
  so-called 'white monks'.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is certainly known that in Elizabethan times there was a
  resurgence of this group which was associated with the
  development of more sophisticated forms of hedge magic and the
  wider availability of these techniques to the more educated
  classes. The groups which formed around the country to exchange
  knowledge and to seek power in the form of knowledge of what they
  called 'the ancients' were loose-knit and tended to be equally
  made up of the younger sons of nobles and churchmen out of the
  direct lines of power and prestige. Their motives were unclear to
  say the least and although some investigators were high minded
  intellectuals, there are records in the library of many others
  who seemingly destroyed what they were to ahve been
       <br>
        investigating.
       </br>
      </p>
      <p>
       The first formal reorganisation of these groups occurred
  during the English Civil war when Oliver Cromwell gathered about
  him such people who were interested in the hunting down of
  information and organised them into the 'Second Model Army' (SMA)
  along the same lines as the New Model Army. This group was
  initially also involved heavily in political espionage activities
  as well as investigation of the occult. Whether any of the
  members realised it or not, it was to become an organisation of
  Witch-hunters whose most prominent member was Mr. Matthew
  Hopkins, the Witchfinder general. In practice, the only 'safe'
  way to use any form of hedge magic, faith or psychic abilities
  was to be a member of this group. Many of the records of the
  period, were sadly destroyed in a fire which wrecked the old
  library in St. Albans whilst the documents were in the process of
  being moved.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the restoration, the SMA continued with it's work, albet
  undercover, as those of the general public who knew of their work
  did not think highly of them. Whilst 'witches' were no longer
  tried or forced to join their ranks, other ways of encouraging
  them to give up their practices were found, which included
  bribery and encouraging the fast introduction of new technology
  as well as threats. By the early 1700s the vast majority of
  numina types had some vague association with this group, but the
  SMA itself had grown distant from the military it was originally
  designed to support and was no longer held in any sort of
  respect. Funding from the government was flaky at best and the
  group was beginning to fracture.
      </p>
      <p>
       This process continued with a few breakaway groupings of
  people with different goals from the original. The next upheaval
  came when a young Danish noblewoman with strong telepathic powers
  became involved with the SMA. In 5 years she had subtley changed
  the direction of the group away from actively hunting witches and
  towards acholarly activity, which for the first time began to
  involve actively seeking out stories from the general
  populace.
      </p>
      <p>
       This trend continued and by the mid 1800s the SMAS, which now
  called itself the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) was
  organised along the lines of an institution with regular meetings
  in different towns across the country and occasional guest
  speakers. Although this attracted a lot of miscellaneous loonies
  the society struggled to maintain high minded ideals. In the
  background, some of the splinter groups that had been formed
  mainly by groups of hedge-mages were also making use of the
  information that members of the SPR had been gathering. The
  senior members of the society had already decided amongst
  themselves that some of the scholarly work being done was more
  worthy than others and although the public donations helped them
  keep up the great library of St. Albans which had been founded
  with the help of the protestant church there, most of this was
  only made available to 'well established' researchers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Members of the SPR were involved in the Parisian 'Wars of the
  Roses', after which the society really did split. The most part
  remained with the SPR, although the less public scholarly branch,
  now calling itself the Arcanum, had for the first time it's own
  organisation within the SPR's umbrella. Many of the more active
  numina-users who felt that simply studying for the sake of
  knowledge was not enough went their own way... Many of the
  Scotland Yard Occult Affairs Squad have psychic abilities and
  ties to one of these breakaway groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today the SPR is still the public face of the Arcanum which
  any member of the public may join. It's executive committee
  (always chosen exclusively from Arcanum members) stands for
  election every 4 years. Members of the executive committee tend
  to have a cosy relationship with some of the other occult
  groupings (although not (knowingly) the inquisition), althoguh
  there have been times when investigative work has been
  concentrated on acting directly against one of the other groups.
  Oddly enough, it is thought that of recent years, the British
  Government (and particularly the Ministry of Defence) has again
  been funding some activities.

  face)

      </p>
      <p>
       The headquarters of the SPR is in a church off Kensington High
  Street. This is where the London branch have their monthly
  lecture meetings, often with slides and tape-recordings, and with
  a tea afterwards. This is also where the monthly newsletter to
  the public 'The SPR Journal', is put togetehr and where most of
  the administrative work of the SPR is handled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apart from the monthly meetings, the SPR has an annual
  conference lasting a week which always attracts some press
  attention due to the outrageuos nature of some of the speakers.
  Many of the public members are conspiracy theorists, oddballs or
  'people with theories' which doesn't do a great deal for the
  general standing of the society.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Arcanum library is based in a building in Hampstead. It is
  run as a private library which any member of the general public
  may join for an annual fee. The man library has a good collection
  of first edition and out of print books on many topics in
  addition to the occult, the basement library and archives are
  open to Arcanum members only and is a rather more useful
  selection. The current SPR executive in charge of the library is
  an ex-army man, Major James Wynne who has specialised in his
  research career in debunking hauntings. He himself is in fact a
  medium, a talent that was only brought to light after having
  suffered shell shock as a young man in the second world war. He
  is in the habit of rearranging the archive shelves every so often
  to bring to the front the topics he is interested in (such as
  documented hauntings) and conceal those he thinks little of (such
  as anything else, which will include vampire sightings).
      </p>
      <p>
       The current librarian, Leonard Long, has been working at the
  library for the last 10 years, ever since the previous librarian
  died. Since he started this work his memory has slowly been
  fading and he has difficulty remembering anything that happened
  to him more than about a year ago. His personality has also begun
  to change to match that of the previous librarian, a
  fiery-tempered spinster. Being an escapist by nature he chooses
  not to think too deeply about this and concentrates his time on
  trying to keep the archives in reasonable condition. This is
  probably why he hasn't found out yet that the previous librarian,
  in her turn, also sufferedsome of the same symptoms.
