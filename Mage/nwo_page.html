   <h2>
    I. GOALS and HISTORY
   </h2>
   The New World Order's goals are
  quite simple, they desire unity. Unity in government, eliminating
  wars; unity in religion, eliminating hate; unity in thought and
  deed eliminating dissension, all eventually leading to the
  reunification of all life, matter, forces, spirit and space/time.
  Anyone or anything which is opposed to the general consensus is
  obviously some sort of disruptive influence and must also be
  eliminated.
   <p>
    More specifically, the Order desires or finds acceptable:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Conformity to a given set of standards,
    </li>
    <li>
     Objectivity applied to subjective reality,
    </li>
    <li>
     Universally Acceptable Ethical Principles,
    </li>
    <li>
     One World Government,
    </li>
    <li>
     An Educated Populace,
    </li>
    <li>
     Well Regulated Militia,
    </li>
    <li>
     Bureaucracy and Administration,
    </li>
    <li>
     Mind Development and awakening of inner abilities,
    </li>
    <li>
     Mind control through technology and applied mental
    development,
    </li>
    <li>
     Complete File Records and Information on all subjects,
    </li>
    <li>
     Establishment of a universally acceptable scientific
    paradigm.
    </li>
    <li>
     The belief that change and dynamism is for the better,
    belying the static image of the technocracy.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    The Order officially began in 1492 with the purpose of
  bringing about this unity through the New World which had just
  been discovered. Previously they had been power hungry groups
  which sought selfish ends. Among them are the Cabal of Pure
  thought, the Knights Templar, and even the Bavarian Illuminati.
  This changed when the possibility of a New Society in therecently
  discovered New World arose at the close of the 15th century.
   </p>
   <p>
    The many conspiracies united under a cell structure that
  persists to this day. No one is quite sure of who or what their
  superiors are. This prevents the structure from compromise. The
  Hierarchy is very strict and obedience is required and ingrained
  during training which is done by specific cells to ensure
  consistent results. These training cells are the true controlling
  entities of the NWO and the only ones that know the exact nature
  of the cell structure.
   </p>
   <hr size="3">
    <h2>
     II. UNIFIED FIELD THEORY
    </h2>
    The illumination or awakening of
  the NWO cell members comes when they realize that all things were
  indeed united at the beginning of the present continuum. All
  forces, matter, and life came from one unifying force (called
  Prime by tradition mages) This force broke down into sub-forces
  of Entropy and Mind, Entropy paradoxically causing the breakup of
  the Prime into three distinct units: Prime, Entropy and Mind (or
  Awareness). These are the three spheres that NWO mages begin
  with. They must raise *all* of them *together* when spending
  experience until they graduate to Intelligence Analyst status.
    <p>
     This theory makes advanced and expensive apparatus nearly
  unnecessary for NWO mages who rely on less technical apparatus
  like Bureaucratic Red Tape, Litigation, or Executive Orders for
  coincidental effects. Unfortunately, any deviation from
  predetermined structure and theory will result in difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      MIND
     </b>
     makes the awareness of the Prime Unified force
  that all true secret masters are able to control, the more one's
  mind is in tune with Prime, the more one's mind can do. Once all
  minds are attuned to the same goals, Prime can once more be
  unified.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suggested Apparatus: Files, Background checks, Surveillance
  Equipment, Research Design, Universal Ehtical principles, Red
  tape (forms), Litigation
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      PRIME
     </b>
     is the flow of the universal force controlled by
  the development of mental ability.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suggested Apparatus: Electricity
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      ENTROPY
     </b>
     (or quantum flux) breaks down Prime into other
  less powerful forces (which are more organized ironic way) these
  organized forces are Electromagnetism, Gravity, Kinetic, and
  Nuclear (strong and weak). These forces combine in different ways
  to produce Matter and Space/Time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suggested Apparatus: Electrical Equipment, Phone Equipment,
  Quantum Mechanics
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      FORCES
     </b>
     are controlled by Mind, organized by Entropy,
  and fueled by Prime. Any forces effect without apparatus will
  need to be a Conjunctional effect of all four spheres. (at level
  2)
    </p>
    <p>
     Suggested Apparatus: Electrical Equipment, Research Design and
  Theory,
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      MATTER
     </b>
     is the organized form of forces, even further
  broken down from mere Prime by Quantum flux. It is controlled by
  the application of nuclear physics, and resource distribution. As
  such it requires a Forces level 2(which means Prime, Entropy and
  Mind) conjunctional effect to use without Apparatus.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suggested Apparatus: Nuclear Plants, Chemical Compounds, New
  Materials (like ceramic composites)
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      LIFE
     </b>
     is a complex form of matter that can replicate
  itself. This is primarily the area of the Progenitors, and the
  New World Order comes into contact with Life primarily from an
  administrative standpoint. Although the Progenitors can directly
  make someone live or die, it is the New World Order which
  determines the right to life. The Technocracy's outlook on
  Abortion and Euthanasia are yet to be decided by public opinion.
  Matter 2 is a requirement for Life Magic performed without
  Apparatus.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suggested Apparatus: Hospital Forms. Ethical Debate,
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      CORRESPONDENCE &amp; TIME
     </b>
     are linked together by the
  Unified Field Theory and require a forces of two (and Prime,
  Entropy, Mind) without apparatus. The concept of Space/Time
  affects technomancers who are busy trying to combine these two
  spheres requiring them, like Prime, Entropy and Mind, to spend
  experience to progress these two spheres at the same rate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suggested Apparatus: Schedule Book, Calendar, Watch, Phone
  systems (...at the tone the time will be ... whatever you want!),
  Any and all communication equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      SPIRIT
     </b>
     is the direct result of uncontrolled mental
  effects upon the Unified Field. This causes resonance to and from
  people's dreams and subconscious belief structures. The spirit
  realm is a dangerous resource that should be closely monitored by
  the Void Engineers. Since they often concern themselves more with
  their theory and science than security, it is up to the Order to
  pick up the slack. By using the VE's to install satellites for
  communication, surveillance, and defense purposes instead of pure
  research, the New World Order ensures the Void Engineer's
  contribution to the POGROM.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suggested Apparatus: Satellites, SDI, satellite
  communications, Surveillance Photos.

       <p>
        Excellent soldiers in the army of Technocratic Acenscion. This
  convention does not rely on the ability of its members but on a
  Objective technology. They follow directive and orders very well,
  but they are the most inflexible of the conventions. Ascension
  will take more than the path the Machine has programmed.

       <p class="c1">
        Progenitors

       <p>
        A fairly free rein is given to these individuals, due to their
  being quite loyal to the POGROM. Unfortunately their experiments
  frequently grow out of control. They should be watched carefully
  and stopped before they become a danger to themselves and
  others.

        Useful middle managers, and nice to have someone willing to
  maintain control of resources, but their belief that the Market
  cannot be controlled except by some "invisible hand" is
  fallacious, and endangers the POGROM. A unified distribution
  system for all resources is absolutely necessary for Acension.
  Their unusual respect for the Nephandi is something to keep a

        In the past a fairly free rein was given to this convention,

  disruptions of the Paradigm has forced us to clamp down upon the
  activites of these Space Cadets. Recently this procedure is being
  reevaluated. Currently the activities of the Void Engineers is
  undergoing a reorganization, with more orientation toward the
