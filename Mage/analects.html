   &gt;From the earliest times, men have been aware of the divine
  spark within them, the Avatar. In the Far East, as in Europe, men
  pursued this divine spark in various ways: religion, magic,
  philosophy and science. But while Europe was a patchwork of
  polities and cultures, giving rise to a diversity of rival
  Traditions, a great unity was achieved in the Orient.
   <p>
    Encoded in the Akashic Record is a vision of prehistory that
  is neither fact nor myth. The Celestines of Dragon, Phoenix and
  Tiger came before nascent humanity and bestowed upon it their
  gifts. The Akashics view all Avatars as having flowed from these
  Celestines: Dynamic from the Dragon, which is yang and full of
  energy; Pattern from the Phoenix, which is yin (not fiery like
  the western Phoenix) and passive; and Questing from the Tiger,
  which is active, aggressive and restless. There is also a fourth
  Celestine, the Qilin (Chi-lin) or Ki-rin, sometimes called the
  Unicorn for lack of any suitable western analogue, which
  represents the Primordial Essence. The Qilin did not come before
  humanity in the First of Days. It is said that only when
  enlightenment, Ascension, is reached will one meet the Qilin.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Chinese call this prehistory of legend the Xia dynasty,
  allegedly the period predating 1600 BCE. The Technocracy has
  worked hard to erase all trace of this era; no archaeological
  evidence of it exists outside the traditional histories of the
  Chinese. The interest of the Technocracy in the matter is in no
  small part due to the Technocracy's presence in China since its
  earliest days.
   </p>
   <p>
    During the Shang dynasty, the Akashic Brotherhood developed
  its theory of the reincarnated Avatar, inspiring the growth of
  ancestor worship in the Orient. The theory also led to the
  Himalayan Wars of 900-600 BCE, when the Akashics declared war
  against the India-based Euthanatos for interfering in the cycle
  of reincarnation. Many splinter groups emerged from the Wars,
  including the Ahl-i-Batin, but also Tantrism and possibly
  Buddhism.
   </p>
   <p>
    With the Brotherhood focussed on the Himalayas, the
  proto-Technocracy gained ascendency in China. Although they had
  previously worked with the Akashics, they resented the
  Brotherhood's dominant position and sought their own view of
  Ascension. The start of the Himalayan Wars coincided with the
  weakening of the Zhou dynasty. From 900 to 770 BCE, the Zhou
  dynasty faltered before the onslaught of rival states to whom the
  Technocracy gave the secrets of bronze, previously a Zhou
  monopoly.
   </p>
   <p>
    The ensuing Spring and Autumn Period was one of constant
  warfare. Kingdoms rose and fell while the rival Magickal
  Traditions battled. The Euthanatos attacked and destroyed part of
  the Akashic Record, driving the Brotherhood from its bases in the
  Himalayas. The Technocracy began hardening the Gauntlet in China
  - by the late 6th century BCE, the annalist Cai Mo is recorded to
  have lamented that dragons were becoming fewer and fewer. New
  weapons were also developed by the Technomancers: the crossbow,
  iron weapons and armor, and the use of horses in warfare. But the
  Brotherhood and its protege, the Qin state, finally triumphed. As
  punishment, the Qin emperor Shi Huangdi ordered all books except
  those on agriculture, medicine and divination to be destroyed.
  Their texts and plans gone, the Technocracy was deemed to be no
  longer a threat.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus around 200 BCE, China became a unified empire under the
  Qin, as much the work of the Brotherhood as that of the Qin
  rulers. In the next two millennia of its existence, the Chinese
  empire became inextricably tied with the Brotherhood's fortunes.
  The Technocracy, once again in a subservient position, co-existed
  uneasily with the Brotherhood. Many of their devices made their
  first appearance in Chinese society, including the magnetic
  compass, paper and paper currency, the moveable type printing
  press, the hydraulic clock, the seismograph, mechanized cloth
  production, iron casting and of course gunpowder. In war, they
  designed siege towers, primitive tanks, bombards and
  flame-throwers. Early Progenitors experimented with the art of
  bonsai, silkworms, goldfish and other animals. By 1300 CE, China
  was on the brink of the ideas and technology which would later
  create the Industrial Revolution in Europe.
   </p>
   <p>
    Buddhism meanwhile filtered into Chian from India. Its arrival
  was greeted by a mixture of curiosity and fear. Buddhist
  philosophy appealed to the Brotherhood, but it was also held in
  suspect because it had come from India, the land of the
  Euthanatos. Buddhism however became widespread in China by the
  5th century CE, becoming accepted alongside the ethical
  philosophy of Confucianism and the Akashic-inspired mysticism of
  Taoism. Under the Akashic influence, the Chan (Zen in Japanese)
  school of Buddhism was developed in China and exported to Japan.
  In contrast, Buddhism largely disappeared in India, possibly
  because the Euthanatos opposed its doctrine of non-violence and
  escape from the Wheel of Reincarnation.
   </p>
   <p>
    Buddhism became the vehicle by which the Brotherhood brought
  its philosophy to Japan in the 5th-8th centuries CE. Similarly,
  it helped consolidate Akashic influence in Tibet, where it
  undermined the authority of the Tibetan sacred kings, the
  Spu-Rgyal, who followed the shamanistic religion of Bon. The
  Akashics thereafter re-established their chantries in the Roof of
  the World which had been lost in the Himalayan Wars over a
  thousand years ago. In Tibet, the Brotherhood also developed the
  Vajrayana or Thunderbolt Way, a form of Buddhism steeped in
  magical practices.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Akashic Way also spread to the rest of East Asia,
  inspiring martial art forms and meditative practices in Korea,
  Indochina, the Philippines and Malaya. The centers of the
  Brotherhood however remained in China, where eight major sects of
  martial arts were developed in similar fashion to the Houses of
  the Order of Hermes in Mythic Europe. These included the fabled
  monastic Shaolin sect, the Taishan sect, the Kunlun sect, the
  all-male Wudang sect and its female counterpart the Emei, and the
  Beggar sect.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the 13th century, imperial China came under siege by
  barbarian invasions of the Khitans, the Jin, the Xi Xia and
  finally the Mongols, who established themselves as rulers of
  China in 1271 CE, giving themselves the dynastic title of Yuan.
  The Akashics and the proto-Technocracy accused each other of
  supporting the invaders, bringing about the final split. The
  Technomancers retreated from China and moved westwards along the
  newly-opened Silk Road. They arrived first in the Abbasid
  Caliphate, where they shared their science and mechanical
  know-how with the Arabs, and then went to Europe, where they
  introduced the Oriental inventions of gunpowder and the printing
  press. After the Yuan dynasty, China virtually came to a
  standstill in technological progress.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Mongol Yuan dynasty planted the seeds of isolationism in
  China, partly because of the shock of occupation by an alien
  power, and partly because the Mongols opened new overland trade
  routes between East and West, as their new empire spanned from
  China to Europe. Through these routes, the Celestial Chorus, the
  Ahl-i-Batin, the Euthanatos, the Order of Hermes and the Cult of
  Ecstasy all began penetrating Chinese territory. The Akashics
  were in the meantime weakened, as the Mongols persecuted the
  martial art sects in China for resisting their rule. The
  Brotherhood moved its center of power to Tibet, which had been
  saved from the Mongols by the diplomatic skill of the Sa-Skya
  Lama. The Brotherhood was also cut off from its brethren in
  Japan, which was subject to wave after wave of attacks by the
  Mongols. The Mongols never took Japan, but the Japanese Akashics
  were effectively isolated. They began developing their own
  practices, nurturing the newly emergent feudal society in Japan
  to inspire the samurai caste.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Yuan dynasty was short-lived and was soon toppled by the
  Ming rulers, who once again had the assistance of the
  Brotherhood. The first Ming emperor had served in a monastery and
  was a disciple of the Way. Returned to power, the Akashics began
  a programme of isolationism to drive out the foreign Traditions.
  The overland routes through Central Asia were closed. The Great
  Wall, originally constructed in the Qin dynasty, was rebuilt as a
  sort of Gauntlet to seal off that which did not fit into the
  Akashic paradigm. Despite the initial success of a series of
  great sea voyages undertaken by a member of court, the
  Brotherhood had the emperor ban all such journeys.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Ming dynasty however ended in corruption, possibly due to
  the insidious influence of the Brotherhood's enemies, the
  Euthanatos, masters of Entropy. The last Ming emperor hung
  himself in 1644 and the newly-united Manchu tribes invaded from
  the North-East. With cruelty and violence, they established their
  new dynasty of the Qing. Once again the Brotherhood and the
  martial art sects resisted, but could not halt the Manchu
  advance. Like the Mongols, the Manchus punished the Brotherhood
  severely for its disobedience, but the Manchus went further to
  actively destroy all martial art sects. Even the ancient chantry
  of Shaolin was besieged and burnt to the ground. Much of the
  Brotherhood retreated again to Tibet, but some stayed to organize
  secret societies to resist the Qing. Many of these secret
  societies eventually outlasted the Qing dynasty, but their
  autonomous nature made them susceptible to corruption and many
  evolved into the present-day criminal Triads.
   </p>
   <p>
    In 1793, the Technocracy returned to China in the form of the
  British mission led by the Earl of MacCartney. The Syndicate was
  the first Technocracy Convention to attempt recapture of China.
  Unable to persuade China to buy manufactures, the Syndicate
  worked with the Progenitors to develop the ancient medicinal drug
  opium into a highly addictive narcotic by mixing it with smoking
  tobacco. The success of the narcotic alarmed even the Qing court,
  and in 1839, the Opium War erupted. This merely gave the
  Technocracy to demonstrate the power of its new weaponry in
  crushing the Qing soldiery.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Technocracy's victory over China was a cause for grave
  concern in the recently-created Council of Nine. The various
  Traditions now attempted to inspire rebellions to assist the
  Brotherhood in opposing both the Qing and the Technocracy. The
  Celestial Chorus encouraged the pseudo-Christian Taiping
  Rebellion, while the Ahl-i-Batin inspired revolts among the
  Muslim tribes of western China. The Akashics regathered their
  strength for one great event, the so-called "Boxer" Uprising of
  1900. The "Boxers", as they were called by Western observers,
  were exponents of the martial arts. In a futile attempt to
  reverse consensual reality, they believed that their skills would
  render themselves invulnerable to bullets.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Qing rulers, feeling power slipping from their grasp,
  turned to the Technocracy for help. The Technocracy crushed the
  rebellions, but the Qing had outlived their usefulness. In 1911,
  the last Qing emperor abdicated. The Akashics were too weak to
  take hold of the opportunity: the failure of the Boxer Uprising
  had drained their resources, and the Qing in one last act of
  spite had invaded Tibet by force in 1906. Fortunately, the
  Technocracy did not anticipate the scale of the anarchy which
  followed. China succumbed into chaos for the next four decades.
  The Technocracy found its hands full with two World Wars, as
  Sleeper societies unleashed the fury of technology against one
  another.
   </p>
   <p>
    Neither the Traditions nor the Technocracy took control of the
  Middle Kingdom in the end. In 1949, the Communist Party assumed
  power. It employed the tools and weapons of the Technocracy, but
  also rejected Western values and penetration. The Akashics did
  not benefit either; they were identified rightly or wrongly with
  the imperial system, and in 1959, Tibet was invaded and occupied
  by the Red Army. The Technocracy attempted to reassert its
  influence through spies and agents, and in 1966 manipulated the
  Cultural Revolution in an ambitious and vicious attempt to wipe
  the Brotherhood out completely. The plan quickly went out of
  control, and the Akashics managed to survive it although with
  great losses.
   </p>
   <p>
    Ironically, the Cultural Revolution created as much xenophobia
  and ignorance about the Technocracy, and preserved consensual
  reality in much of China in favor of the Akashics, who now hide
  in their mountain retreats. A new battle may be unfolding as
  China slowly opens her doors once more to the outside world, but
  for now, the Brotherhood waits in its secret chantries and
  mountaintop monasteries.
