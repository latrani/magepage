Subject: Planetary correspondences
Message-ID: <m0qnJXH-0009Z5C@whoa.cosmic.com>

About a week ago, I posted a theory about which planets corresponded to
which of the spheres of magick in Mage.  These attributions were based on
certain real life systems of magick which Mage mirrors almost to perfection
(allowing for the necessities of game mechanics).

One question that was raised in response was "Well, if the planets
correspond to these spheres in Mage, what *else* corresponds to these
spheres and planets?"  Here's a partial listing of correspondences, drawn
primarily from Qabalistic magick:
