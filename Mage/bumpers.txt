Trust is good - control is better.

From: Ludo <ludo@technocom.com>:

Dreamspeakers :
I brake for abominable snowmen
Scrap this car
In the event of a Gauntlet-breach, just drum

Akashic Brotherhood :
I kill over "Grasshopper" jokes
I know what you're going to do
I only use this car to baffle Farandwee

Hollow Ones :
If you're going to drink and drive, don't forget to drink
I plan to be buried in this car

Euthanatos :
This car only looks empty
No matter the number of rebirth-cycles, I still end up driving a
sub-compact

Order of Hermes :
I'd tell you a joke, but you'd have to learn Latin
Sealed with a kiss
