    History:
   </b>
   The Phoenix Project is a joint effort between Wyrm
  corrupted Sons of Ether and Progenitors, who seek immortality.
  Not an immunity to age, as the Kindred possess, or the ability to
  return from the dead, as do Mummies, but a way to
   <em>
    never
  die.
   </em>
   While some may argue that such a desire in itself isn't
  inherently evil (Euthanatos, Dreamspeakers, Choristers, and
  Verbena would all disagree), the members of the Project intend to
  use their gift to create a new reich, and, with their other
  magicks, rule the world for all eternity!
   <p>
    In 1948, a Nazi Son of Ether named Hans Goeffels, began
  gathering corrupt scientists from the Nazi military and
  concentration camps, after a mysterious "benefactor" showed Hans
  the fall of the Third Reich. Hans gathered the Wyrm tainted
  Progenitors who experimented in human breeding to create a
  "master race," and the corrupt Sons of Ether working on making
  various weapons for the Germans. In order to sneak the the
  Nephandi technomancers away from the SS, Hans called upon his
  "benefactor" to create duplicates of the scientists to take their
  place. This act gained the attention of the Iron Circle, an
  ahriman that dealt with occult matters for Hitler, and caused
  Hans and his fellow escapees to be labeled as traitors. Clashes
  between the Iron Circle and the Phoenix Project still occur to
  this day.
   </p>
   <p>
    The technomancers, grouped and led by Hans, fled Germany, went
  to hiding in various South American countries. All knew of the
  impending downfall of Nazi Germany, but could do little to stop
  it. Instead, they began working on a way to gain immortality, for
  they all agreed that if they could but gain life eternal, they
  would have all the time they could want to shape the world in
  their image. This idea never seemed insane to the Nazi fanatics,
  but they knew that they could never hope to achieve it while
  confined to the limits of this reality.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was in 1952, in Argentina, that Hans revealed his
  benefactor as the to an assembly of the technomantic Nephandi.
  While they had seen Hans talking to a person wearing that they
  called the Dark Monk as a slight insult, they themselves had
  never had any dealings with it, only through Hans did they
  receive its instruction. The Dark Monk, so called because it
  always wore a black robe with the hood pulled down, revealed its
  true face to the assembled group. The racist mages gasped in
  terror at the monster that stood before them. Hans inwardly
  smiled, believing that his fellow Germans would never serve one
  who was not of Aryan blood, and that their loyalty to him was
  assured. A false thought he still holds true.
   </p>
   <p>
    Immediately upon disrobing a shimmering portal appeared behind
  the Dark Monk, revealing an island surrounded by beautiful waters
  and dark stormy skies. Hans smiled proudly and said, "here my
  brothers is our promised land. Here is the palace of the
  Phoenix!" Within a matter of days the Nephandi had entered the
  seemingly deserted Horizon Realm and made it into their own. And
  the Dark Monk was happy that Its realm was once more aiding It on
  Its path to Ascension and dominance of Gaia.

     Overseers Members:
    </b>
    Dark Monk (?), Hans Goeffels
  (Master, Son of Ether barabbi)
   </p>
   <p>
    Background: The Overseers jointly rule the Phoenix Project,
  with the Dark Monk giving orders to Hans, and Hans passing them
  on to either the Scientific Core or Acquisitions, as he sees fit.
  While Hans believes that his fellow Nazis hold loyalty to him
  alone, they are divided in their loyalties. This error will prove
  fatal to Hans when he makes his move to oust the Dark Monk.

  Horton (Master, Son of Ether barabbi), Anna Goeffels (Master,
  Progenitor barabb i)
   </p>
   <p>
    Background: The Scientific Core is responsible for conducting
  experiments into maintaining immortality. Adolf, a FACADE
  engineer, deals with Mind transferal to clones. Gretchen is
  developing a means to extract a human consciousness and transfer
  it to a robotic body. Ernst and Anna work together trying to find
  a biochemical or surgical procedure to stop cellular aging and
  decay (they're currently exploring tissue grafts from human
  embryos). And Peter is in charge of studying any interesting
  features possessed among other Awakened species (eg. resurrection
  among Mummies).

  Harold (Master, Dreamspeaker barabbi)
   </p>
   <p>
    Background: They get guinea pigs. Acquisitions is in charge of
  capturing live specimens of Kindred, Garou, Mummies, fomori, and
  anything else that is deemed needed by the Scientific Core.
  Acquisition members are all known for their knowledge of Awakened
  species, and for their abilities to wield magick offensively.

   <h2>
    Environment:
   </h2>
   The Phoenix Project is situated in the
  Horizon Realm of the Dark Monk. It consists of the Phoenix Palace
  (the Chantry), on top of a large grassy island, surrounded by a
  ocean that seems to go on forever. A strong breeze is always
  blowing, and despite the intensely dark storm clouds above, there
  is always plenty of light and never any rain. Thirty feet away
  from the island shore is the entry point into the Realm, and one
  must swim through the sea to reach the Palace. Within the waters
  are strange wyrm creatures who aid those in the Phoenix Project
  while attacking all others (even other Nephandi!). As one nears
  the hill, the denizens of the Island can be seen.
   <h2>
    Denizens:
   </h2>
   The Acquisitions ahriman brings many strange
  creatures from throughout the Umbrae to the Scientific Core. So
  far all creatures have been turned into "failed experiments."
  Such creatures, still living or un-living, have their minds
  destroyed, are programmed to seek and destroy any non-Project
  members, and let loose on the island.

    Labyrinth Description:
   </h2>
   <b>
    Palace of the Phoenix:
   </b>
   The
  Chantry house rests on top of an island previously described.
  From the outside it appears as a multi-level Minoan/Roman
  structure constructed out of a lavender colored marble. While
  there are numerous pillars set into t he walls to provide support
  for the ceilings, a student of architecture will not that the
  tops of the pillars are not of a Mediterranean design, but
  consist of patterns reminiscent of an M.C. Escher painting. The
  interior, while still seeming to be of an cient design, has had a
  series of power cables and hardware installed (including security
  cameras, p.a. systems, and bizarre defense systems created by the
  Sons). The Palace contains over eighty rooms and almost as many
  corridors, with the scientists' re search laboratories on the
  ground floor, their living quarters on the second, and the third
  floor (all fifteen rooms) off limits to all but the Dark Monk (it
  is "his" realm after all). Hans has noticed that the ley lines
  which supply the realm are focuse d on the strange pillar tops,
  but has yet to find the Node sites to which they are connected to
  (see below). It has also come to Hans' attention that he and his
  technomancer allies are not the first to use this realm. This
  lack of knowledge makes Hans even more determined to overthrow
  the Dark Monk, and rule the realm unchallenged.
   <p>
    <b>
     Berlin House:
    </b>
    This is one of two earthly aspects the
  Project members possess. The Berlin House is used as a simple
  place to unwind, and get away from their work for a while, but
  due to their highly competitive nature they seldom take advantage
  of it facilities. The Berlin House is located on the outskirts of
  Berlin, and consists of a walled-in estate, a three story
  mansion, and an olympic level indoor gymnasium. It has every
  luxury a person could desire. Despite the Project's Nazi origins,
  no evidence of their political beliefs are present due to their
  declining Nazi fervor and German laws which they fear would bring
  them unwanted attention.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Training Camp:
    </b>
    What the Berlin House lacks in Nazi
  paraphenalia, the New Reich Training Camp (as it is some what
  secretly know) makes up for ten fold. It is here that Hans trains
  and recruits (and occasionally experiments upon) Neo-Nazis.
  Located in a small town in Louisiana, the camp is protected by
  local police and citizens, who are all either members or
  sympathizers with "the cause". New recruits are flown in from
  around the world, and trained in military and terrorist tactics,
  while being even more indoctrinated with Nazi propaganda (via
  devices create by the Sons). The camp is hidden in a valley on a
  stretch of the town mayor's property, covered with camouflage
  nets to prevent aerial detection. Automatic weapons, over-zealous
  "soldiers," and a large grouping of fellow believers (and willing
  volunteers) provide Hans and his allies a power base for more
  mundane and direct actions on Earth.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Purpose:
    </b>
    The Phoenix Project, as directed by Hans, is
  dedicated to establishing immortality in order to establish an
  eternal reich on Earth, with Hans as leader. Or so Hans believes.
  In actuality, ALL of the technomancers desire to rule the world
  in one form or another. And the Dark Monk uses the Phoenix
  Project to....
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Chantry Inhabitants:
    </b>
    Besides the various Wyrm creatures
  found in the sea, there are numerous Garou, Kindred, and fomori,
  all "lobotomized" and turned into guards. Also of note is a
  mentally undamaged Mummy the Project keeps as a subject of
  study/experimentation (under heavy restraint of course). And some
  mages have begun to see fleeting images form and disperse within
  the storm clouds.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Internal Structure and Relations:
    </b>
    All mages seem to
  cooperate and work together towards the goals of immortality and
  a fourth reich, goals which Hans based the Labyrinth upon. Over
  the years the mages have largely lost their exterior Nazi
  trappings, keeping only the beliefs and prejudices within
  themselves. While all claim loyalty to Hans and the Dark Monk,
  their true loyalties are not so fixed. Jack Ernst and Anna all
  support Hans, and work with him to overthrow the Monk, while
  Harold, Peter and Aldof either serve or work with the Dark Monk.
  The rest plot how best to gain power for themselves.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     External Relations:
    </b>
    While not xenophobic
  (
    <em>
     yet
    </em>
    ), the members of the Phoenix Project realize that
  they are wanted worldwide as war criminals, enemies of humanity,
  servants of the Wyrm, and traitors to Nazism. Combined with the
  fact that their goals of immortality and world rule conflict with
  everyone, the Project members do their best to keep their
  existence a secret. In fact, the Acquisitions members all change
  their appearances and behavior patterns (using Life and Mind
  magicks) each time they leave the realm, and revert to normal on
  their return. A process all the mages repeat as well.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Status and Reputation:
    </b>
    Being all but unknown, the
  Labyrinth has low ratings in both even among fellow Wyrm
  constructs.

   <b>
    Policy Regarding Outsiders:
   </b>
   Once again, the secretive
  nature prohibits the Project from interacting with outsiders
  (save the owner of the Berlin House, and the director of the
  Training Camp). If someone approaches the Project attempting to
  join, he must first be of Aryan or Caucasian stock, devoted to
  Nazism, and prove himself to Hans and the others. All other
  applicants would be used as an experiment and lobotomized.
   <p>
    <b>
     Allies and Enemies:
    </b>
    In addition to the Neo-Nazis at the
  training camp for mundane needs, the Dark Monk can call upon a
  few Wyrm spirits of great power to assist it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Just as the secrecy of the Project allows it few allies, it
  possess few enemies as well. As it is only the Iron Circle and a
  cabal of Euthanatos work to destroy it, along with attacks from
  strange Nephandi creatures. If the Project were better known it
  would surely have more enemies.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Research Capabilities:
    </b>
    An excellent (if somewhat dated)
  collection of mundane books and equipment were taken by the
  Project members upon their defection from Nazi Germany. Over the
  decades the Nazis have added a few articles of magickal
  significance (mainly in the spheres of Matter and Life) to the
  millennia old collection of the Dark Monk. Some of the Dark
  Monk's magickal treasures and tomes are of indecipherable use to
  the technomancers (and almost any other mage as well).
   </p>
   <p>
    In the field of transhumanistic studies, lifeform alteration,
  and immortality research there is no other area more suited to
  the task. Acquisitions also seizes any items, living or
  otherwise, that the Project requests, including various magickal
  and mundane things (although magickal items are targeted only if
  deemed of utmost use and necessity).
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Nodes:
    </b>
    None known, and the Dark Monk will keep it that
  way. Hans is desperately trying to, secretly, discover the
  location of the Nodes that supply this realm. All attempts at
  tracking the leylines away from the pillar tops to their
  respective Nodes has failed, and Hans would give anything to know
  not only where the Nodes are, but how the Dark Monk hid them so
  well.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Stories:
    </b>
    The main theme of stories involving the
  Labyrinth would be of struggle; not (necessarily) the struggle
  one finds in the middle of combat however. The mages of the
  Project struggle to find a path to immortality, against each
  other, and to keep their secrecy. The guardians of the realm
  would struggle against all those who try to invade, and the
  prisoners will struggle to escape.
   </p>
   <p>
    The mood of the Labyrinth could best be described as
  revulsion. All "visitors" to the island are revolted by the
  inhabitants and their inevitable fate. Some among the
  technomancers themselves have become disturbed by the depths of
  the experiments (due to resonance), as well as to the nature of
  their backing. And the Dark Monk...?
   </p>
   <h2>
    Stories
   </h2>
   <ol>
    <li>
     The Dark Monk, for reasons unknown to all of the Project
    scientists, sends the Acquisitions branch to acquire
    information the PCs. The Acquisitions will accumulate a vast
    amount of information, but will not try to directly confront
    the PCs... until the PCs find them snooping around their
    Chantry. Acquisitions should escape so that the PCs could meet
    them again in the next scenario.
    </li>
    <li>
     The PCs are hired by a Mummy to locate a friend of his who
    was last seen investigating a para-military camp in Louisiana.
    This would be an excellent means to pit the PCs against the
    mundane level of hate groups, and the Project members would
    most certainly try to "remove" anyone who knew of their
    location.

    Background:
   </b>
   No one on the Phoenix Project knows the
  true identity of Harold, save Harold himself and the Dark Monk.
  He managed to join the Phoenix Project by tracking them through
  the Umbra, and proving his knowledge of the Awakened on Gaia.
  While Hans was distrustful of the young mage, Harold possessed
  two features which caused Hans to allow Harold to join. First
  Harold was a blond haired, blue eyed devotee to Nazism, and
  secondly, Hans realized over a few weeks time that the Dark Monk
  would subtly act against Harold, a factor Hans believed to be due
  to the fear the Nephandi felt towards the young Master of Spirit.
  Unknown to all save Harold and the Dark Monk, is that Harold is
  actually a servant of the Dark Monk, spying on the others in the
  Labyrinth and
   <em>
    very
   </em>
   secretly assisting the Dark Monk in
  it's true plans.
   <p>
    <b>
     Image:
    </b>
    About 5'8", Hans weighs a measly 138 lbs. He has
  blonde hair, blue eyes, and a very fair complexion. He looks to
  be about 30 years old and frequently dresses as if he is about to
  go on an outdoors expedition or a hunting trip (which he usually
  is). It should be noted that Harold is not naturally blonde
  haired, or blue eyed, or even caucasian. The Dark Monk, using
  Life and Prime magicks, managed to change Harold's ethnicity and
  altered his life pattern so that the change was undetectable.

     Roleplaying Notes:

    A new reich will never happen, but
  you must convince the others that it is your goal on life. You
  secretly despise the Nazis, and everything that they stand for,
  but your mentor desires you to play this foolish game. So, you
  transfer your zeal to serve your mentor to serving Hans and his
  dupes, while knowing who really pulls the strings of the show.
  Just go along and obey them, but not for much longer.

    Background:
   </b>
   Anna is the daughter of Hans Goeffels.
  She was one of a handful of children specially bred as part of
  Hitler's plan to create a "master race." It was this misguided
  attempt at genetics that caused Anna to be fascinated with
  genetic ma nipulation, and learn under the Progenitors of the
  Phoenix Project. Anna is a complete follower of Nazism, and is
  just as devoted to her father. Anna current experiments with
  fresh human embryos requires her to extract them from their
  "developing center," a process which inevitably ends in the
  destruction of said "center." The fact that Anna has tried to
  find a less harmful method to get the embryos from their mothers
  has caused many to suspect that Anna is growing weak. Anna says
  it is a matter of wast e to kill the mothers, and with Hans
  support no one has yet to challenge her.
   <p>
    <b>
     Image:
    </b>
    Anna is the perfect image of a Nazi woman,
  combined with the frame of a gold medal athlete. She has
  genetically altered herself to look fit and healthy, while adding
  extremely beautiful looks. The end result being that her body is
  capable of doing more than its structure would suggest. She looks
  21, despite being born in 1947, and tends to dress in lab coats
  and pants.

     Roleplaying Notes:
    </b>
    Hans is paving the way for you and
  you must prove yourself worthy. Remember two things though: Nazis
  are the dominant race, and women are the dominant sex. Always
  prepare for the day when you and your father (the only man worth
  anything) will rule the world together. You must also try to keep
  your sympathy towards those you use, and your true feelings for
  Hans a secret; if either were revealed you would be ashamed to
  stay in the project.

    Background:
   </b>
   Hans Goeffels was the second son of a
  small Aryan peasant family born in 1899. It was when Hans watched
  as his brother was cut in half by a barrage of bullets during a
  raid on an enemies trench that Hans' Avatar awoke. Hans, assigned
  as machine gun operator due to his knowledge of mechanics and
  targeting skill, had been working on a way to improve the kinetic
  velocity of his bullets so that they would go through dense
  matter and retain their lethal force. With his awakened Avatar
  Hans fired off the first shot of his new design. The bullets
  ripped through the ground and padded walls of the French
  trenches, killing scores of men. The next wave of Germans
  decimated those who remained, and still Hans felt no relief.
   <p>
    With the loss of World War I and the humiliation of Germany,
  Hans felt only anger and rage. Seeking somewhere to focus this
  blind hatred, Hans tried by focusing on weapons development. He
  would make sure that Germany would never lose another war. Hans
  became interested in Hitler, who also held similar views and gave
  Hans a scapegoat to blame for his brother's death. Hans gained
  the attention of the Germans and raised in their ranks as a
  weapons designer. The concentration camps turned him against
  Hitler, not due to their inhumanity, as much as their "waste".
  Hans believed that living slaves were much more useful than
  rotting corpses.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was also at that this time, early in 1943, that Hans began
  to believe that he, and not Hitler, should be the founder of the
  thousand year reich, or even an Eternal Reich! A belief that
  would eventually lead to a failed assassination attempt against
  Hitler a few months later. Hans kept working on V-2 rockets, atom
  bombs, and even space vehicle designs until he met the Dark Monk,
  and changed the path his life would take.

    Hans is a tall (6' 5"), handsome man, with a
  very powerful presence, made more so due to his age (seemingly 63
  years). Hans has a thick head of silver-grey hair, and keeps a
  clean-shaven face. He typically dresses in loose-fitting shirts a
  nd slacks.

    You have seen too many things. Too
  many inept leaders ruling their inept peoples. It is your
  responsibility to rule them with an iron hand, for the soft touch
  they currently receive is preparing them for their downfall. You

  suffer under your reign, but those who resist and suffer and not
  one of the "ubermen," and what happens to them is of no

   <h2>
    The Dark Monk
   </h2>
   The year was 1993, the season was fall, and
  Dee Shields was thoroughly depressed. He was a sophomore at the
  University of Chicago, majoring in Psychology. He believed that
  he'd learn everything there was to know about the subject, and
  then cure himself. He knew it probably wouldn't work, but it gave
  him a bit of focus in his life.
   <p>
    Then the nightmares started, and with them, the dreams which
  became his only joy. He dreamed he was in the foulest reaches of
  some bizarre hell, struggling to escape from its pits and cities.
  He dreamed the wind lifted him and carried him to new heights. He
  met people in these dreams; some tried to help him and some tried
  to hurt him, but they all seemed so real and they all kept
  returning.
   </p>
   <p>
    Dee reflected on these dreams in the waking world, and found
  them much more appealing then anything in reality. In his dreams
  he could control reality, shaping things to fit his needs, and in
  them he found a true love. Dee began to wish he could spend
  forever just dreaming, exploring the bizarre vistas that exist
  both within and without from his mind. It was as his love was
  trying to help him open the door that would permanently sever his
  link to the waking world that tragedy struck.
   </p>
   <p>
    One night, while dreaming, Dee tried to shatter the link,
  which would kill himself, but failed. Instead, the dreamscape
  collapsed for a moment, killing his love, an event Dee blamed on
  himself and which sent him into a nervous breakdown. Immediately,
  three figures appeared within the dream, trying to control the
  raging ma ge, whose Orphan Avatar had just awoken. Dee's first
  act upon Awakening was to sense the Avatar's within the other
  mages and absorb them into his own. He immediately woke up.
   </p>
   <p>
    The next weeks were spent in futile attempts to recreate the
  love he had destroyed, and come to grips with his newfound
  abilities. He found his power growing with every dream he had,
  until suddenly, he stopped dreaming altogether. In the waking
  world h e could hear the spirits of the night and wind speak to
  him when was alone and on the verge of suicide. But even their
  caring words would not sway him.
   </p>
   <p>
    The pills had been taken a few hours before, followed by a
  last meal from Hardee's which he ate in seclusion. Dee didn't
  know if he could find or recreate his love, but he knew that even
  if he would dream again, and that alone would more than make up
  for the cost of his death. As he slept he had found himself
  flying into a dense cloud of grey, faster and faster, until he
  could hear his heart beating and his heavy breathing from his
  slumbering body. Faster and faster came the breaths and the
  beats, and he closed his eyes in fear.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then he could hear nothing. Nothing except the roar of the
  winds around him. He opened his eyes to see the grey turn into a
  swirling maelstrom of shapes and colors, almost all of which were
  beyond his ability to describe. And then he felt it, the changing
  of his body. He screamed in ecstasy/anguish as the pleasure/pain
  of having his flesh turned became too much for him to bear. He
  sought a release, any escape, and saw a patch of greyness (the
  one he entered through) ahead. He struggled against the thing he
  would later call the Flux, and found himself in the grey clouds
  once again.
   </p>
   <p>
    He now knew that he was a living dream, the soul of
  once-living mage, and opened a gateway to Earth just by thinking
  about it. He was startled when the first thing he saw was a group
  of men wearing nothing but leathers and wielding spears. He was
  startled because he had meant to return to Chicago, and ended up
  in some alternate world. It would take weeks for Dee to
  eventually realize and accept that he had gone over ten thousand
  years back in time to primitive Europe.
   </p>
   <p>
    Dee found that creating a body was no problem, but it always
  would evolve into a humanoid mass of tendons ands muscles. So Dee
  took to wearing a black robe, and concentrated on only altering
  those parts of him that would be visible to the majority of
  humanity. He spent centuries developing his magicks, particularly
  learning how to manipulate the energies within all things. He
  also studied how to manipulate time (which he would never
  master), abandoning the world of his dreams for this world, once
  he could more easily manipulate it. But even though he may have
  abandoned his dreams, he still held onto the memories of his
  love.
   </p>
   <p>
    He encountered early Garou, and learned of their Caerns, sites
  of power. The Garou welcomed him as a brother, until he revealed
  his true form, when they labeled him a minion of the Wyrm. Dee
  was hurt and fled into what would be known as middle East, using
  his magick to defend himself. As society grew, Dee watched and
  wanted to establish himself as a benevolent God. It was at this
  time that Dee encountered the first of the Kindred.
   </p>
   <p>
    Dee could sense the seemingly endless amount of power the
  undead possessed, and knew of their appetites. Fortunately, they
  seemed to prefer living in their cities than venturing to the
  collection of small tribes which the Dark One, as Dee came to be
  known as, protected. Until one day when tragedy struck.
   </p>
   <p>
    A Kindred, which the Dark One would come to believe to be the
  founder of the Gangrel clan, found the Dark One and his
  collection of tribes. Gangrel, sensing the power inherent in the
  Dark One, desired to honor him by Embracing him as the second of
  clan Gangrel. Gangrel, succumbing to her predatorial urges,
  decided to stalk the mage before Embracing him. A stalking which
  the Dark One took as a prelude to an attack (which it more or
  less was).
   </p>
   <p>
    The Dark One took the offensive, surrounded by dozens of his
  followers, and struck Gangrel with a bolt of sunlight. The battle
  raged on, as Gangrel, angered by the assault, summoned the
  animals to kill the mage and his followers as she fed off the
  blood of the fallen on the edges. In the end, only the Dark One
  and a score of his strongest warriors were standing against
  Gangrel, pumped up with the vitae in her veins. The Dark One,
  seeing how Gangrel consumed the life of others for strength and
  remembering what he had done so long ago, drained his followers
  of their souls.
   </p>
   <p>
    His strength renewed, the Dark One pressed the attack against
  Gangrel yet again, and caused her to flee into the night, back to
  city Caine. As the Dark One, fearing reprisal, fled from the
  area, Gangrel told Caine of the mage and his black robes. Caine
  warned all citizens of the city to beware the Dark One who stole
  the souls of the living, and the kine kept that belief after the
  fall of the first city, and spread the fear of the adversary who
  ate souls into their religions.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Dark One travelled throughout Asia, and watched as the
  Chinese empire grew, and with it the Asian vampires, descendants
  of Caine he assumed. Fearing more conflict with the Kindred, the
  Dark One returned back to Europe, and settled in Rome during the
  age of Augustus Caesar. While in Rome, the Dark One eventually
  met, and befriended, a Brujah who taught him much about the
  Kindred. The Brujah was fascinated that the Dark One had fought
  and beaten a Antediluvian, and the Dark One, in turn, was
  relieved that not all Kindred were as powerful as the one he had
  fought.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Dark One began accumulating magickal treasures as well,
  trading with the Ventrue and Malkavian rulers for magickal tomes
  and talismans. He knew that Rome was meant to fall anyway, was he
  evil for being a tool to destroy a vast civilization and plunge
  Europe into a centuries-long Dark Ages? Was he? He decided that
  he would chose his own destiny, using what he had to work with.
  That, like many other decisions, would return to haunt him.
   </p>
   <p>
    As he accumulated magickal knowledge from by Kindred and
  merged it with scrying done into the future, the Dark One
  discovered the possibility that he could create and rule a
  dimension, a dimension where he could find a way to recreate his
  lost love.
   </p>
   <p>
    He started by finding Garou caerns, and, with Kindred support,
  stealing the Caerns from their Lupine defenders and claiming them
  as Nodes. Once the Dark One had enough Caerns, he began building
  his Horizon Realm, the Palace of the Phoenix, where his love
  would be reborn. But as the Roman Empire fell, his Kindred allies
  turned on him, thinking him to be the cause of their downfall.
  The Garou also sought him for raping their sacred lands, and
  early mages also sought him not only becuase of his numerous
  thefts, but also to gain his collection.
   </p>
   <p>
    With his numerous enemies, the Dark One had to hide his realm
  and himself or else have to fend off a seemingly endless number
  of enemies. He chose to hide. He knew that his realm could be
  traced by following the ley lines that led from his Nodes either
  by following the energy or by sensing through (what he scryed as
  being called) Correspondence. So, he looked far ahead into the
  future, to a point where mankind no longer existed, and
  transported the Nodes to that time, while keeping the ley lines
  intact.
   </p>
   <p>
    And there he went to try and recreate his love.
   </p>
   <p>
    Over the centuries, he faced off against strange, demonic
  creatures who entered his realm, and the occasional mage or two.
  In response to these attacks he filled the sea around his island
  with bizarre, twisted creatures of his own, while strengthening
  the shell around the realm. This proved well for centuries, until
  the Dark One acknowledged a flaw in his use of time magicks. He
  could not see beyond vague details of his own "lifetime", or the
  period of time between his birth and Awakening. He used his
  knowledge of history to get him by, and scrying into future
  events that weren't directly related to his life.
   </p>
   <p>
    He needed to know if he would succeed, he had to find out if
  all his effort were in vain or not. And, at that moment of self
  doubt, a being calling itself Jonathan Harker arrived. Jonathan
  managed to sneak past the guardians of the sea and approached the
  Dark Monk (as the Dark One, once Dee, liked to think of himself).
  Before the Dark Monk struck the Nephandi down, Jonathan offered
  to answer the Dark Monk's burning question and others, and the
  Dark Monk would not lose any part of soul or have any Wyrm
  invasion on his soul by accepting Jonathan's offer. But there
  would be an "unset" price to pay for every answer.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Dark Monk, in a moment of extreme hubris, accepted.
  Jonathan told the Dark Monk he would indeed find his lost love,
  but that he would need to steal the Avatar of an immortal mage to
  do so. Jonathan also told the Dark Monk that he (the Dark Monk)
  was such an immortal mage. Three facts, three bills to pay.
  Jonathan laughed and said, "the first price is that you shall
  never know your own time, the second is the Wyrm shall invade
  your realm unchallenged, and the third..." and Jonathan smiled
  before he disappeared.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Dark Monk realized that this was why he could never
  foresee his own destiny. But the second part had him worried, not
  nearly as much as the unpaid third however.
   </p>
   <p>
    As the months passed, the Dark Monk saw his creatures become
  more violent, and felt as the dark skies he once held so dear
  became filled with darker things. And he knew that soon the
  Nephandi would come. But just as in Rome, he believed that he
  could choose his own destiny, and so he set out to chose the
  Nephandi that would invade his realm, leading him to Hans and his
  Nazis.

  bend in weird places (eg. three knees on each leg), standing
  about eight feet tall, and

    Better the devil you know than the

  keeping your "eyes" on these Nephandi. Once one of 'em gets
  lucky, drain his Avatar and get rid of the rest, the messy way.
  Even stupid little Harold. Just be careful, don't let yourself be
