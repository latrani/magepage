   Orbital Collective One
  </h1>

  <p>
   All mages, regardless tradition, seek their vision of
  Ascension (or Descension, in the case of the Nephandi). And
  through the ages they have created visions or realms mirroring
  their ideals, hoping to gain clues on how to make them real.
  Orbital Collective One is the vision of the Technocratic
  Ascension.
  </p>
  <p>
   Physically, OCO is an O'Neill-style orbital station, a
  rotating cylinder 10 kilometres long and 2 kilometres wide. Its
  inside is a lush garden landscape, not unlike the mountains of
  Province or wine- yards of California. The flora and fauna is
  needless to say the best the Progenitors can design. Near the
  ends of the cylinder the land begins to slope upwards, becoming
  steep mountains reaching up to the zero-g axis. From beautiful
  waterfalls (where the water near the top is almost weightless)
  rivers flow down into the valley landscape below, ending in a
  central lake. Along the axis an elegant truss-structure holds the
  artificial sun which lights up OCO and the sprinklers that
  provide the regular rains (one at noon and one at midnight). On
  the outside of the colony immense solar collectors gather energy
  and quintessence to fuel the realm.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the valleys below lies six cities, each housing 50,000
  inhabitants (this has been judged as the optimum for studying and
  designing social dynamics) named A, B, C, D, E and F. In addition
  to the six cities there are also six smaller villages called G,
  H, I, J, K and L, each containing 500 inhabitants for small-scale
  studies. Both cities and villages are centred around a community
  centre from which radiates a triangular network of street and
  monorail lines. Each section contains living quarters, factories
  and shops, all set in a regular pattern. The buildings are
  identical hexagonal houses of white concrete, surrounded by small
  gardens.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 303,000 inhabitants of OCO are all happy, loyal citizens.
  They are free from genetic defects and live lives supported by
  the most advanced Progenitor medicine until they reach 65, when
  they die painlessly surrounded by their loving families (there
  have been some discussions of removing death altogether, but the
  Ivory Tower did not want to tackle the demographic problems yet).
  From childhood to grave they live perfect, sheltered lives
  supported by the advanced technology and friendly advice from
  their DEIs (which also allows the Ivory Tower researchers to
  monitor their actions). Dissatisfaction or antisocial behaviour
  is very rare, but when it occurs the Freedom Police quickly
  appears and bring the deviant to the Coordination Centre for
  curing.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Coordination Centre is the main Technocracy construct in
  the realm, responsible for monitoring and optimising its
  functions. It is a hexagonal truncated pyramid by the lake,
  linked to the axis by an elevator line. Inside the Void Engineers
  monitor the performance of the realm, the progenitors control the
  biosphere, the Syndicate manage the economy, Iteration X keeps
  the systems running and the New World Order observes the social
  life and thoughts of the inhabitants. The technomancers all have
  roomy, if slightly austere, offices and laboratories with a
  breathtaking view of their accomplishments outside. Beneath the
  Centre are hangars and garages for various vehicles, including
  airlocks to the outside (although most access to OCO is through
  the axis station) and a reserve of HIT Marks. The top levels of
  the Centre house the Administration. Here the Administrators
  oversee the progress towards Ascension, both on OCO and on Earth.
  These high ranking technocrats coordinate and plan future agendas
  for the symposium, beside coordinating and regulating the
  terrestrial contructs.
  </p>
  <p>
   The other major technocracy constructs on OCO are the axis
  stations, located along the axis on the outside of the cylinder.
  Unlike the austere but harmonious Coordination Centre, the axis
  stations are pure functionalism in Iteration X/Void Engineer
  style, with bulkheads, steel tunnels with girders and spartan
  living modules.
  </p>
  <p>
   In this weightless environment the Void Engineers dock their
  craft and work with their various monitoring systems. One of the
  current major projects is the deployment of a
   <a href="http://www.astro.nwu.edu/lentz/space/ssi/sps.html">
    SPS
   </a>
   (Space Power Satellite), a solar collector several kilometres
  wide intended to beam the energy/quintessence of space to an
  receiver installation on earth. There are also several quite
  powerful weapons systems on the OCO, intended to defend it
  against most outside threats. A squadron of Void Engine Fighters
  are always on standby to defend OCO from intruders.
  </p>
  <p>
   Among technomancers, being stationed at OCO is regarded as a
  promotion, even if it is just to the axis stations. Not only is
  the realm quite pleasant (and even the axis technomancers are
  allowed to spend their spare time inside), but it is an
  administrative and political centre. But most importantly, OCO
  cheers the technocratic spirit with its perfection - this is how
  Earth will become.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Mood
  </h2>
  Imagine the paradise depicted on the pamphlets of
  Jehovah's Witnesses or architectural drawings: beautiful people
  walking on sunny streets with happy children and perfect weather.
  There is no dirt, no crime, no smut here, only positive social
  emotions. Everybody wants to be productive and part of the whole.

   This Perfect Day
  </i>
  by Ira
  Levin.
  <p>
   Resonance in this realm affects the technomancers too. Even
  the Iteration X units tend to become more polite and social, and
  even the most egocentric Syndicate businessman will feel an urge
  to keep society stable and perfect. The paradigm is needless to
  say extremely rigid - here only technomagick works, and the
  Gauntlet is as hard as diamond.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Story Ideas
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Infiltration
  </h3>
  The traditions would love dearly to
  infiltrate OCO, to learn its weaknesses and spy on the high
  ranking technocrats. The PCs may be assigned to infiltrate the
  realm masquerading as sleepers, replacing some of the real
  inhabitants. They will have to fit in in this ideal society,
  avoid being detected and fulfill their mission. Or the PCs may be
  victims of a NWO mental game, placed in one of the villages where
  everybody treats them as they have always been living there, and
  their ideas about magick is only delusions...
  <h3>
   Promotion
  </h3>
  Technomancer characters are given sudden and
  unexpected promotion to OCO, maybe after doing some spectacular
  feat to help the Technocracy. But life at OCO isn't quite as
  idyllic as it may look... there are hints of some kind of
  power-struggle in the highest echelons, and the PCs may get
  caught in the middle of it. Does the Administrators really know
  what is going on down on Earht? Do they even care? And why is
  someone giving the HIT Marks new software ahead of schedule?
  <h3>
   Prisoners in Paradise
  </h3>
  Tradition PCs might end up in OCO
  if they are captured by the Void Engineers in the Deep Umbra (or
  perhaps
  <i>
   saved
  </i>
  by the Void Engineers?). While they await
  transfer to Earth or MECHA, they are kept in custody in the
  Coordinator Complex. This is the chance for meeting with the real
  high level technomancers, who might be chillingly normal and
  reasonable. Escaping from OCO could also be an interesting story
  - magick is very weak on OCO, the sleepers
  <i>
   love
  </i>
  the
  Technocracy and does anybody in the cabal know how to control a
  Void Engine Fighter during re-entry?
  <h3>
   The Second Sun
  </h3>
  The SPS is about to be tested, giving a
  Technocracy construct on Earth a huge (albeit experimental)
  source of energy and quintessence. If the Traditions get wind of
  this, they will quite naturally be interested in sabotaging the
  attempt. But there are other problems too: the beam of energy
  might actually punctate the Gauntlet and Horizon on its way
  towards the ground, providing a portal for some of the nastier
  denizens of the Umbra - not to mention what would happen if the
  Marauders could overcome the Technocracy defenses and redirect
  the quintessence into something more "useful", like burning up a
  city or two.
  <p>
   But in some cultures there are also myths about the birth of a
  great saviour heralded by the appearance of a second sun in the
  sky...
