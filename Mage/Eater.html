   The Souleater is one of the most horrible and powerful beings
  known to mankind. Many mages who have confronted it actually
  thank the Technocracy for erecting the Gauntlet to protect
  humanity from it and its ilk, and some have even argued that the
  Gauntlet is a necessary evil to protect from it. The being has
  been called many things during history, like The Dweller on the
  Threshold, Yog-Sothoth or Azazel.
   <p>
    The Souleater literally eats souls. It will rip the avatar
  from a person and incorporate it into itself. The victim will be
  fully conscious during all of this, and will remain so for
  eternity inside the Souleater. The being slowly digests the minds
  and souls of its victims, an excruciatingly slow and painful
  process which takes millions of years. Their memories, skills and
  thoughts become part of the Souleater, while they wordlessly
  scream forever inside it. There is not even the oblivion of
  madness.
   </p>
   <p>
    Fortunately, the Souleater seems to have great trouble
  manifesting inside the Gauntlet, or even inside the Horizon. It
  has been called the Lurker of the Threshold, ready to slither in
  whenever it can find a new opening. When it manifests in the
  physical world it quickly gains so much paradox it has to leave
  after a short time. It can however possess a person from the
  Umbra, and thus interact with the world. It is not uncommon for
  it to eat the soul of the victim, and then use his body as
  mouthpiece. The body spasms and is contorted by cramps while the
  being uses it. When it is done, it simply discards the body. When
  it manifests in the Umbra, it will look like a monstrosity
  without name or form. Its tentacles (?) are covered (or made of)
  screaming and pleading human faces, and apparently it has an eye.
  Apparently, because nobody has ever survived looking in it.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Souleater is intelligent, but not in a human way. It
  thinks using all the minds it has ever eaten, knows everything
  they know and senses everything they sense. This makes it
  unpredictable and almost infinitely intelligent, at least in some
  aspects. Its personality, if it can be said to have one, is pure
  malign hunger. Since it cannot think well about anything it
  haven't absorbed, it must eat it to understand it. Its voice has
  been described as crude petroleum seeping through gravel. When it
  speaks, it seems to shift between the personalities of all its
  victims, sometimes talking imperiously, then childishly and
  suddenly completely normal. Most of the time it is completely
  incomprehensible, just a meaningless mass of screams, pleading
  and nonsense.
   </p>
   <p>
    Fortunately, the being cannot rip away just any soul. To be
  able to eat the soul of a victim, the victim must somehow accept
  the Souleater. This can range from a symbolic gesture to a moment
  of understanding for the being. The important thing is that the
  victim has some kind of mental or emotional contact and
  acceptance of the being or a part of it (like a previous victim).
  That is enough for it to be able to eat the soul of the new
  victim. Using Mind on it is a
    <em>
     bad
    </em>
    idea. Another way it
  can gather souls is from dead and dying people who are much less
  resistant to its power. It is sometimes attracted by the death of
  many people, especially if it is a highly unnatural death.
   </p>
   <p>
    Mages from the Celestial Chorus have discussed whether it is a
  kind of Anti-One. Unlike the One, where all avatars are
  harmoniously integrated the Souleater is a agglomeration of
  unwilling Avatars, a mocking parody of the true One. Some
  Euthanatos mages believe that the Souleater is the manifestation
  of the most intensely anti-entropic forces of the Collective
  Subconscious. Both groups agree that it must be hindered as much
  as possible and perhaps even defeated (but how that should be
  brought about is anybody's guess). Garou say that the Souleater
  is an aspect of the Wyrm.

    <b>
     Physical abilities:
    </b>
    As much it wants to. When
  manifested, it can be as powerful as it need to be. When
  possessing somebody, increase strength and stamina by two and
  decrease dexterity by two due to the intense cramps.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Mental abilities:
    </b>
    Practically all. Only the most recent
  victims skills and memories are clear, the rest are vaguely mixed
  together and may take some time to remember. When confronted to
  something normal or common, it can react quickly. When confronted
  to something unusual or unique, it has a harder time reacting. It
  has obvious problems with being social.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Magick:
    </b>
    The Souleater can at least in theory use the
  magickal abilities of its victims, but it seldom uses other
  spheres than Spirit and Mind.

    </b>
    The Souleater rips
  away the soul of a victim and incorporates it into itself. The
  victim will feel a horrible sensation of mental tentacles
  reaching out and pulling his soul from his body, into the maw of
  the being . If the victim fails to resist the Souleater his soul
  is absorbed. Otherwise, he is completely incapacitated by pain
  and the exertion of his fight for his soul while the Souleater
  tries to make him join it.
   </p>
   <p>
    [The victim can resist using Willpower like any normal mental
  attack. The target number is 10, and each success will decrease
  the successes of the Souleater. If the victim botches, he will
  immediately be eaten, while if the Souleater succeeds, the target
  number is increased by the number of successes the next turn,
  when the fight goes on. In this way, the being slowly and
  painfully pulls his victim into him. Obviously, almost nobody can
  resist it.]
   </p>
   <h2>
    Story ideas:
   </h2>
   A boring cliche: a group of Nephandi are
  sacrificing souls to the Souleater to make it gain power and
  perhaps even entrance to the Earth. They must sacrifice more and
  more souls to prevent it from eating their own souls, so they are
  encouraging accidents and war to get a supply. The players come
  upon this plan and perhaps ought to do something about it.
   <p>
    An important person, a friend of the characters or somebody
  with important information has become the victim of the
  Souleater, and the characters must find it, and then negotiate
  with it for it to either release the victim or tell them what
  they want. Are the characters ready to give the Souleater what it
  wants, or are they brave (and foolish) enough to try to trick it?
  And what about the victim?
   </p>
   <p>
    A powerful Euthanatos mage (perhaps even an Oracle) believe he
  has found a way to fragment the Souleater and free the imprisoned
  souls. He want the characters to help him with the necessary
  preparations. They might find unexpected help from other groups,
  even the Technocracy, in doing this. However, the Souleater is
  immensely powerful and will doubtless know about their plans.
  What if the mage is wrong, and fails? What if the Souleater turns
  out to be a necessary protection from something even worse?
