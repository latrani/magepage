Just so everyone knows where I stand, on a scale of 1 to 10 in
terms of "bleak darkness", 1 being Cyberpunk 2020 (some
elements of darkness, makes a nod at realism), 10 being
Kult crossed with SLA Industries (so dark as to be totally
unplayable and utterly non-fun), I put the WW games at:
Vampire 7, Werewolf 9, Mage 4, Wraith 8.5.

Now, this is not a problem---just an observation.  I like three
of the games a lot, and Mage is one of them.  Heck, I like
CP2020 a lot (a heck of a lot more than Werewolf, I can tell
you that...)  But Mage just doesn't rank with the other games
in terms of "darkness".  This, to me is the greatest problem
with "crossing over", not whether or not Mind 3 can detect
Obfuscate 4.  Mages just live in a different world.  In a
different "game", if you will.  So here are my suggestions on
how to "darken" Mage.  Take a few of them: mix and match
untill you find a combination you like.  Using all of them
would be going a little overboard.


1.  Dismal Failure.
	So let me get this straight.  Mages can change reality.
They are powerful beings whose mere whim can alter the shape
of things in the present and the future (some even say the past...)
	So how come the world is so crappy?  The Technomancer dream
has utterly failed to become a reality.  The Traditions' efforts
are both no better and no more likely to succeed.  Anyone who
thinks different is living on hubris and needs to be taken down a notch.
The winning coalition in the Mage world is the Nephandi, not the
Technomancers.  The Techies are totally ineffectual in the world
compared to the Neffies.
	Emphasize the failures of the characters.  Have they won
a victory?  Make it a Pyrrhic one (look it up).  A scorched-earth
scenario.  Both sides lose.  The world returns to it's natural
shitty course.


2.  The Traditions Bite.

AKASHIC BROTHERHOOD: Play up the utter pointlessness of the A-Ks.  Their
meditation doesn't take them closer solving the world's problems,
it takes them further away from the world.  This abandonment of the
world is absolutely necessary to their paradigm.  Force the characters
to give up everything they like, everything they want and everything
and everyone they ever loved.  It's a pure paradigm, but an empty one.

CELESTIAL CHORUS: Failure again.  They had control a while back, but
they dropped the ball.  Continually emphasize how the hierarchy
stumbles on, blindly making the same mistakes over and over again.
Paralyze the Chorusers in internal strife while around them the world
marches on.  Point out how hopeless the world is and how Paradox
prevents the CC from bringing hope back.  Love, neighborliness, 
spirituality?  These are from a world that no longer exists.  Kids
murder each other in the street for shoes, and everything the Chorus
does is empty self-gratification.

CULT OF ECSTASY: Not much has to be done to make these guys more dark.
Just make sure they always have the opportunity to be partying when
they should be somewhere doing something that would have saved the
day, and things will take care of themselves.

DREAMSPEAKERS: Boy, you want to talk about your failed paradigms,
take a look at these goons.  These are religious adherents of the
worst kind: avid faithful who are set upon with a growing idea not 
that their religion is false, but that their god(dess) is useless.
Another good alienation Trad: all their gallivanting around the
Umbra can't solve anything in "the real world."  Make sure they
have to go home and make sure they see what's happened while they
were gone.

EUTHANATOS: Not much needs to be added to make these guys more
dark.  Just point up the total autocracy of the Euth, how they
are the sole and final judges of human life...of any life on Earth,
and show how pointless their whole reincarnation schema is: souls
are born and reborn into a terrible world.  Wouldn't it be better
just to go the route of the Nephandi and get rid of them entirely?
They should be portrayed as one step away from the Nephandi and
maybe that step was in the wrong direction...

HOLLOW ONES: Play with these ones like you would a jaded Toreador.
Make their callousness to human suffering and continual angst
backfire by putting them in gradually worse and worse situations.
I'll bet that by the time they're watching their loved ones get
roasted by that Marauder, they'll be squirming to get out of
their dead-end nowheresville paradigm.

ORDER OF HERMES: A) Emphasize the meaninglessness of it all.  How
come there are 49 kinds of angels and not 50?  Because that's the
way it is.  B) Emphasize the dictatorial atmosphere.  C) Make
sure they have to do some really gross occult crap every once in a
while.  Otherwise, I don't have too many suggestions.

SONS OF ETHER: For "pulp" Sons of Ether, throw them into a harshly
realistic world.  Imagine the cast of "I Love A Mystery" tossed
headlong into a modern-day comic book.  Can you say "culture shock"?
They'd be dead in 10 minutes, and not at the hands of a super-
villain, either.  Force them to choose between pushing themselves
further into delusions or to (gasp) admit utter defeat.
	For other Sons of Ether, emphasize the "mad" part of "mad
scientist."  Fanaticism.  Delusions of grandeur.  Vicious in-fighting.
When you enter a SoE lab, it should be less like the "Back to the
Future" theme and more like the "Terminator" theme, less heroic
trumpets and more buzzing, impersonal machines.

VIRTUAL ADEPTS: Make sure the VAs understand exactly what place their
product has in the real world: the tool of the Technocracy.  Fight
the Technocracy all you want.  It's too late: the Sleepers already
have a hold of it, and they've already put it in the paradigm.
You won before you left.  Now you lost.

----------

TECHNOMANCERS: First of all, I think Technomancer PCs are just fine.
In fact, even for the dark campaign, it's a good idea.
	First, make sure they understand that they are parts in a
machine, and are no more cared for by their superiors than they
care for the parts in their car.  They should be under nearly-
constant surveillance by the New World Order and Iteration X.
	Second, make sure they understand that they do not control
the paradigm.  If the paradigm were under their control, things
would be all right.  Things are not all right.  Things are definitely
not all right.  Why are things the way they are?  The Technocracy
doesn't know either.  Point out over and over and over the
differences between Technocracy idealism and actual reality.



Well, that's this first batch of ideas.  Any others out there?
