   Sons of Ether Paradigm
  </h1>

  <hr>
   The Sons of Ether are interested in creating and understanding a
  new paradigm, or Model, based on their research and discoveries.
  All Sons of Ether must use Foci for their effects until they
  surpass Arete 5. At this level, SoE scientists understand their
  Model well enough to begin to accurately predict results without
  doing experiments (just as in the Real World!), or by
  coincidentally preparing the Model in just such-and-such a way,
  etc. and thus are less dependent on Foci than the Conventions. To
  balance their greater dependence vis-a-vis most of the Traditions
  there is a greater chance that magick will be perceived as
  coincidental when performed by an Etherian.
   <p>
    Sons of Ether often have similar paradigms as their
  Technomancer brethren,the Virtual Adepts. Thus, collaboration and
  conflict between these Traditions are the stuff of legend. "As
  brothers fight ye!"
   </p>
   <p>
    There are many paths of study that seek to research/define a
  complete and logical paradigm, or Model. This is the major area
  of disagreement between the Etherians and the Technocracy. Both
  agree, following the basic tenets of the philosophy of science,
  that nothing is truly knowable. The Technocracy has decided to
  tacitly assume there is an Objective Reality which will behave
  according to laws the Technocrats discover. Because of the
  influence of the Islamic Scroll, the Etherians tacitly assume
  there is the Subjective Reality defined by the logical
  implications of their Models. Thus, both approach the same
  problem with the same tools but from different directions. For
  example, both groups race to prove things that are not possible
  in the paradigm of the other; this is known to others as the
  Ascension War. Vulgar magick is a problem for both. For the
  Technomancers, it is allowed (barely) by the doubt about what
  Reality truly is. In the same way, the Etherians use Vulgarity to
  press the envelope of their Model.
   </p>
   <h2>
    The Paradigm
   </h2>
   <b>
    The Model
   </b>
   -- Reality is simply a
  model to be altered. It is best to alter reality under laboratory
  conditions because this allows the scientist to hold all
  non-experimental variables constant. As a result, Sons of Ether
  aren't really action oriented. Rather, their technomagick is
  ususally carefully designed to fit within the Model that they're
  researching. The Etherians have been pressed to produce useful
  results by the Ascension War, but this is still not their primary
  focus. Ehterians like to point out that the Chinese had gunpowder
  for hundreds of years and did nothing better with it than make
  pretty lights. Was making that technology into a tool of death a
  good thing? The Oppenheimer Syndrome (I am become Death, the
  Destroyer of Worlds) strikess enough Etherians to ensure their
  technology is released at a more judicious speed, and then only
  to those who can deal well with it, such as when they developed
  Trinary circuits and computing devices for the Virtual Adepts.
   <h2>
    Magick
   </h2>
   <b>
    Theorem
   </b>
   -- each effect is essentially a
  theorem played out in the Model, the results of which are
  measured for future research.
   <h2>
    The Spheres
   </h2>
   The following Model, just one of many, is
  called the
   <b>
    Keplerian Model
   </b>
   in honor of the magician and
  scientist Johannes Kepler who tried to prove the existance of the
  Music of the Spheres. The idea animating the Model is that there
  are many vibrational planes which interact in ways that create
  the patterns we percieve in our world. The scientist can
  harmonize himself (mentally, biomechanically, etc.) with these
  vibratory planes, thereby allowing direct interface and
  perception with the vibratory energies.
   <p>
    The Model is comprised of eight or nine interacting Vibratory
  Planes, each of which can be acted upon. Thus, the Keplerian
  Model posits everything in the Tellurian is actually the harmonic
  interaction of the Basic Vibrations. A wall, for example, is not
  a wall. It is the result of the interation of Matter and Prime
  Vibrational energies in a particular way.
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <b>
      Prime -- Vibration Zero
     </b>
     . This is the least well
      understood of the Vibrations. While it is a little mystical
      for the tastes of the Etherians, they feel it better to
      explore it anyway rather than let it stop them cold as it
      would the Conventions. Those criticizing Keplerianism say
      that Vibration 0 is a logical impossibility. If something has
      a zero vibration, then it isn't vibrating at all! Proponents
      say that it is like a mathmatical convenience, only more.
      Just as you can use certain techniques which add zero to an
      equation and yet yield different results and allow certain
      proofs, so certain Vibrations need Zero added to them to
      become "real." While other Vibrations do not require the
      addition of Zero, experimental evidence has shown a
      statistical correlation between adding Zero and the
      generation of some effects. In the same way, you can subtract
      Zero to change or impede Interactions.
     <p>
      Unfortunately, it is difficult to use and manipulate That
      Which Is Not. An early Keplarian hit upon the idea of using
      electricity. Electrical "vibrations" (amplitude and
      frequency) are easily variable and allow a scientist to
      quickly ascertain by successive iterations the correct value
      of Zero to add or subtract from the equation governing the
      underlying Vibratory interaction. While not perfect, this
      method works as well as any. Research is ongoing.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Forces -- Energy/Vibration 1
     </b>
     . All forces can be
    generated through harmonic patterns from this Vibrations. By
    setting up a harmonic to draw the electrical pattern out of
    Vibration 1, a nearly perpetual energy pattern can be
    established. Keplarians are eager to prove this and cite
    superconductivity as one example of this principle.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Matter -- Matter/Vibration 2
     </b>
     . All materials are
    composed of composites of base harmonic patterns that originate
    from Vibration 2.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Life -- Biomechanics/Vibration 3
     </b>
     . Living organisms
    are clearly mechanical in nature; the harmonics that manifest
    living materials are drawn from Vibration 3
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Entropy -- Probability, Chaos/Vibration 4
     </b>
     . The
    violent signals of Patterns cannot be drawn from Vibration 4,
    but the breakdown effect can be controled with an overall
    "volume control" on the harmonics; a Vibratory Potentiometer,
    if you will.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Time -- Time/Vibration 5
     </b>
     . The passage of events
    would not be possible with out the presence of Vibration 5
    energies. Time is also a part the "position equation" of
    Pattern Interactions, just like the T in D=RT except for being
    more complicated and elegant due to the nature of paradigm
    multidimensional analytical math. While these energies, like
    Vibration 4 harmonics, cannot be formed into discrete patterns,
    its presence can be raised and lowered, thereby speeding or
    slowing the passage of events. It is much easier to measure
    this Vibration than to change it. Research is currently being
    conducted in generating mirrored harmonics that may neutralize
    or actually reverse the energies emanation from Vibration
    5.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Spirit -- Gestalt/Vibration 6
     </b>
     . When Vibration 6
    energies are introduced into other harmonics, the resulting
    patterns achieve some sort of self-awareness or sentience.
    While it is theoretically possible to synchronize one's
    Vibratory Pattern with any given Vibratory plane and thus enter
    it, in practice it is much easier to enter this one than any
    other. It is not clear why this should be so, other than the
    fact that six and multiples of six make working harmonization
    equations very easy. Research continues.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Correspondence -- Location/Vibration 7
     </b>
     . There are
    several views of this Vibration. It may be that all other
    harmonic patterns are forced away from a central point because
    Model-wide Vibration 7 patterns, harmonically present in all
    other vibrations, repel one another. Another view takes the
    position that "nothing exists; all is vibratory interaction."
    Thus, the Universe can be said to be as a single point; the
    Interaction or Correspondence Point. Some hold both theories to
    be correct, depending on the purpose of the observation, giving
    Reality a sort of wave/particle duality.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Mind -- Reverberation/Vibration 8
     </b>
     . This plane may or
    may not exist. Empirically, it is true that Ideas have a
    "separate existance;" a life of their own. This strongly
    indicates a vibratory plane that would sustain ideas. However,
    some think that Mind effects are actually effects of resonance
    patterns of Gestalt and Biomechanics. Scientists continue to
    use this "plane" to the extent they find it useful.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h2>
    Arete
   </h2>
   <b>
    Insight
   </b>
   -- the trait that all true
  researchers seek. With sufficient insight into the interaction of
  vibratory energies on the Model, the Model can be subtly altered
  without outward signs of changes. Eventually, the highest levels
  of insight will allow extreme alterations to the Model without
  creating destructive disharmony. Scientists with very deep
  insight can control and create harmonics with their Mind.
   <h2>
    Quintessence
   </h2>
   <b>
    Zero
   </b>
   -- This again has to do with
  adding or subtracting zero from Vibratory interaction.
   <h2>
    Paradox
   </h2>
   <b>
    Disharmony
   </b>
   -- Chaning Interactions can
  cause Disharmonies. The resulting disharmonies seek to correct
  themselves without damaging the Model. These disharmonic energies
  unfortunately tend to collect in the biomechanical patterns of
  the scientist, often causing unforseen (and possibly
  serendipitous) errors in research or surprising changes to the
  local Model.
   <h2>
    Mage-specific Backgrounds
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <b>
      Arcane -- Acoustic Muffling
     </b>
     . Some scientists appear
    able to alter their acoustics within the Model, seeming to
    destructively interfere with Reverberation frequencies at will
    within a certain range.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Avatar -- Battery
     </b>
     . The name is inaccurate yet highly
    satisfying. Vibration Zero "energies" do seem to lead to the
    success of Theorems in the Model. Scientists with large
    internal "batteris" can intuitively predict useful types of
    zero to be added to future experiments. The scientist adds
    these values to his own biomechanical pattern until
    needed.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Destiny -- Focus
     </b>
     . Scientists with intense focus can
    work miracles and never stray from their research. Those with
    this much focus are invariably brilliant and arrogant. Highly
    focused scientists are not above stealing other scientist's
    work and some have made their names solely by this method.
    These folks make Etherians walk on eggshells at times, but they
    are a source of hope and inspiration as well.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Dream -- Data Vibratory Detection and Retrieval
     </b>
     .
    Some scientists learn to attune their mental resonance to
    absorb information from Vibration 8, the source of all theorems
    and repository of all existing data.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Node -- Generator
     </b>
     . Perceiving useful values of zero
    tends to be aided by being near a generator. Generators have
    the interesting and as yet unexplained ability to generate
    useful values of zero locked with in Matter or Bio patterns.
    Keplerian nodes tend to have as their certain piece an Engine
    aids this process by generating random values of zero in the
    hopes a Zero pattern will coalesce around them.
