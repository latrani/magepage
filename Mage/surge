Subject: Monitors - Surge



Monitors - Surge
	Surge Monitors are Digital Monitors, spirit allies of the 
technocracy recruited long ago by the Void Engineers.  They are of a
sub-class known as Digital Monitors, which are largely restricted to the
Digital Web.  surges are the most violent of the common Digital Monitors.
Their ultimate origins can be traced back to naturalistic lightning
spirits, but centuries of adaptation have shaped them into electrical
techno-spirits  They have been shaped to act as Black I.C.E. and Assasins 
on the Digital Web, but spend most of their time in a resting state online.
They only become active when disturbed by the passage of an "unauthorized" 
or being sent tracking an incon oid Engineer's orders.
	In their resting state, they disperse into a form that is difficult
to detect, called a Surge-Net.  The techno-turf of the Digital Web is often
girded with several surg-nets.  Those using Forces 1 and Spirit 1 while in 
the net will see the surge-net as a large, decentralized network of 
spiritually charged electrical current, so low in power it blends into the 
natural environment of the web otherwise.  Those using prime one as well will
notice a point of quintessense-heavy charge moving through the net rapidly.
	A Surge-Net responds whenever it is crossed by an icon that does not,
according to it's files, have access to the area it guards.  When such an icon
enters the net, the net's current pervades the icon.  The net collapses as the
prime-charged core of the spirit enters the icon in a manner that is
superfically similar to the entry of a virus.  The Surge Monitor lurks withint
the Icon until it sees an oppertunity to attack, preferring to attack when the 
victim is alone.
	When a Surge Monitor decides to attack, it has two options.  It can 
"step out" of any icon it inhabits, forming it's own icon to attack with, or
can trace back to the cybernaut's body and attack it directly.
	With the first option, the icon formed and the icon it comes from
are initially visually identical.  As time passes, the Surge Monitor icon
becomes more fractal and shifts to a neon red/green/blue technocratic color 
pattern.  In five minutes it resembles a fairly standard humanoid technocracy
icon.  Research on having the Surge Monitors retain the image of their victim
continues.  When the Surge Monitor attacks, it's physical blows are weak, but
carry powerful electical charges.  
	The Surge Monitor also has the option of flowing along the power
systems back to it's victim's body.  There, it can cause equipment overloads.
This not only destoys hardware, it can damage the victim's body with intense
sound, intense light, or sometimes even kill by electroshock.
	If a Surge Monitor is itself killed, it's quintessence can be gathered
by a fast-acting mage.  This takes the form of an electrical tass.  This 
Tass is prozed by Virtual Adepts, because it is resonant with the Digital Web
itself and can be used to enhance almost any magick in the web more efficently
than normal Tass.  This Tass is rarely worth the trouble of collecting it 
though.

	Electrical Touch:	The touch of a Surge Monitor can cause four
dice of electrical damage, over and above any physical attack.  A surge who
does not attack can use this on any being striking it's body.

Magick:
- Monitor Web ( * Forces, * Mind, * Prime ):	This effect is used to monitor
the Icons that pass through the spirit in Surge-Net form.  It indexes them
against an internal list of icons allowed access.  Because of the Prime 
components, re-shaping an icon to look like an authorized one is ineffective.
- Surge Net ( ** Forces, ** Prime, *** Spirit ):	This is the effect
Surge Monitors use to switch between their iconic and surge-net forms.
- Infiltrate Icon ( ** Forces, *** Mind ):	With this, a Surge can enter
an icon.  It gains no control over the icon, but receives the same sensory
information the icon does, and remains within it until it decides to exit.
- Trace Icon ( ** Correspondence, * Prime, ** Time ):  This allows the Surge
Monitor to track any icon that has passed it, determine the previous movements
of any icon it enters, and track down any icon it is given a conplete enough
file about.
- Equipment Surge ( *** Forces, *** Prime, *** Spirit ):  As electricity, a
Surge Monitor can enter most electrical devices, it can then cause it's own
spiritually charged current to overload almost any such device.  This causes
short circuts and burnouts, and erases the RAM of most computers.  Several
successes can even physically destroy a computer's ROM.
	The most feared ability of the Surge Monitor is when it uses this on
active VR equipment.  It can emmit radiation powerful enough to damage a 
cybernaughts hearing and vision permanently.  If the equipment is the most
recent type the Virtual Adepts use, the kind that uses electtrodes to 
simulate tactile senses, the Surge Monitor can make a full-strength Forces 3
electrical attack on the mage's body.  The terrible part of these attacks is 
that unless the Cybernaut is using a Correspondence 3, co-locate perceptions 
to watch over his body, the damge goes unnoticed until he exits the Digital
Web.  


Note - conventional surge protector devices will not protect from one of these
spirits.  However, the main reason for the Virtual Adpets introducing the
various power boards to computers was to make Warding Talismans against Surge
Monitors a coincidental device.  Still, many people on the web have never
hear of the Surges.
