  <h1>
   The Acolytes of The Sacred Logos
  </h1>
  This was a secretive
  order for members of the Order of Hermes and Celestial Chorus
  (and related minor groups) dating back to the late middle ages.
  It was founded with the sole purpose of uniting the different
  traditions against all enemies of Logos, the Word: rival
  traditions, mages using their powers to seek material wealth and
  influence, people ruled by their base desires and religions
  denying monotheism.
  <p>
   At the beginning the Acolytes had some success, they gained
  allies in many other groups, such as the Brotherhood of
  Bertrando, Collegium Lux Aeterna and the Inquisition. However,
  the Acolytes failed almost totally to forge the alliance between
  the High Mages of Europe they sought against low mages, heretics
  and pagans due to the internal schisms between the various
  hermetic and choristic orders. When the Order of Reason began to
  rise, the Acolytes had long ago fallen to vicious infighting and
  power mongering, although some of their ideas were latter taken
  up by other groups and erroneously interpreted as early visions
  of unity of all traditions against the Technocracy, Nephandi and
  Marauders.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, recently there have been a renewed interest in the
  Acolytes, mainly from the conservative wing of the Celestial
  Chorus. Under the leadership of Cardinal Hounsgaard a new order
  have been started, The Renewed Order of the Sacred Logos. The
  Order has roughly the same ideology as the original Acolytes, but
  seeks its members exclusively from the Celestial Chorus. Instead
  of political manipulations, the Order is quietly pressuring
  chantries in catholic countries to conform with its politics,
  hoping to create a strong front against heresy, ecumenism and
  atheism among the traditions.
