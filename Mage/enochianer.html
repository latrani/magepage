    The Enochians
   </h1>
   <h2>
    A subgroup of Order of Hermes
   </h2>

   <hr>
    The Enochians are a small group inside the Order of Hermes. Not
  many mages outside of the Order know of them, and even among the
  members of the Order they are not very well known. Those mages
  who know of them regard them with a mix of irritation, worry and
  respect. They are a small, isolationistic fraction which tend to
  avoid contact with outsiders, spending their time and energy in
  study or on their secret projects.
    <p>
     While they lack any real influence on the rest of the Order,
  the enochians have played a important role in the development of
  the Hermetic theories of magick. Many theories advanced by
  enochian mages have become mainstream in the Order the last few
  centuries. But the enochian mages have a very different view from
  their more conservative brethren.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many hermetic mages are studying magick in order to find the
  foundations of the Universe. The enochians claim they have found
  them. The rest of Order of Hermes remain sceptical of their
  claims, and argue that the enochians certainly have found some
  very important truths and made several influential discoveries,
  but hardly
     <em>
      The Truth
     </em>
     . The enochians seldom reply to the
  criticism, and continue their work.
    </p>
    <h2>
     History and Philosophy
    </h2>
    The study of enochian magick began
  in April 20th 1587, when Dr
    <a href="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/jpd/dee.html">
     John Dee
    </a>
    , the
  famous Elizabethan mage, and his medium Edward Kelly encountered
  a being in the Umbra. This Being, which called itself the
  archangel Raphael, gave the mages a tablet of letters today known
  as "The Great Tablet", or "The Tablet of the Four Watchtowers".
  According to Raphael, it contained the secret names of the
  angels. The mages began to experiment with it, and found that
  they could summon a hierarchy of spirits, which today is known as
  the "Enochian Hierarchy". From communications with these spirits
  and Raphael they began to formulate a theory of the Universe and
  magick, which became the enochian theory of magick. Soon they had
  gathered followers in the Order of Hermes, and became a small but
  dedicated group which still continue to work today.
    <p>
     The enochian theory of magick is complex and hierarchic. Every
  being, every pattern and every process have a superior. This
  superior have another superior, and so on. To control something
  the mage must contact a spirit or force which rule over the thing
  the mage want to happen. To create fire the mage must summon one
  of the angels of fire. To extinguish the fire the mage must
  summon another angel who controls the extinguishing of fire. A
  more powerful mage may of course summon a superior of both fire-
  angels, but this may be a bit risky since the superior angel may
  become irritated with the mage asking such trivial services.
    </p>
    <p>
     Enochian magick use the enochian language. This language is
  the true language of spirits according to the enochians. It is a
  complex language with almost no vowels and an alphabet without
  earthly counterpart. Most mages in Order of Hermes acknowledge
  that enochian is a very powerful language, and some groups use it
  besides the enochians. The enochians tend to be very careful to
  use it correctly, pronouncing everything exactly right. According
  to at least some enochians the language is so powerful that a
  incorrectly pronounced letter in a ritual can bring the mage
  certain doom.
    </p>
    <p>
     Enochian magick is based upon the secret names of angels,
  spirits and demons found in the
     <a href="file://nic.funet.fi/pub/doc/religion/occult/magick/hermetica/enochian.great.table.eps.Z">
      Great Tablet
     </a>
     . This tablet, a 27x25 rectangle of letters
  without any meaning to a non-enochian, contains the secrets of
  the universe. The letters represent the true hierarchy of forces
  in the universe. It is the blueprint of the universe, containing
  the true name of every angel, spirit, demon and god. Every
  pattern exists in this tablet, every human fate, and even the
  fate of the universe. The question is in which directions the
  mage reads it - horizontal, vertical, diagonal or in zigzag.
    </p>
    <p>
     In short the universe works as follows: In the top of the
  hierarchy there is The Highest, the Unknowable, the True Force.
  This pure state of existence have allowed a tiny spark of itself
  to fall down to create the universe. The force divided into the
  four elements. Each element is ruled by one secret name. Each
  element is also ruled by three god-names. These 12 names
  correspond to the signs in the zodiac. Each element is also ruled
  by the planetary lords of each element, besides the names of God.
  The elements mix with each other, and create 16 sub-elements,
  like Air-Water or Fire-Fire. Each of these subelements is ruled
  by two names of god, one to call upon the angels of the
  sub-element, the other to control them. Each sub- element has one
  archangel and four servant angels. Finally, there are the
  cacodaemons, the simplest entities who actually do the dirty work
  of creating the universe. There are 1024 greater cacodaemons and
  a lot more smaller demons.
    </p>
    <p>
     The universe is divided into 33 aethyrs, each separated from
  the others by almost impassable walls, or ring-pass-nots as they
  are called in the jargon. The physical world is the lowest of the
  aethyrs, surrounded by higher and higher spheres. The Gauntlet
  and the Horizon is the two lowest ring-pass-nots. Many enochians
  believe the ring-pass-nots must be broken down to ensure the
  future ascension of humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Everything that happens is part of the Great Plan. Nothing is
  random, everything is planned from the beginning by the Highest.
  The mage must understand this Plan, and do his or her duty as a
  servant of the Plan. This plan for the universe is revealed in
  the forty eight keys, 19 short invocations in the enochian
  language (The final key, "The Call of the Thirty Aethyrs" is
  counted as 30 keys for at total of 48 keys). Most enochians spend
  much time studying the keys, meditating on their meaning and
  listening to what the spirits have to say about them.
    </p>
    <p>
     To use his magick an enochian often calls upon some of the
  angels, spirits or demons using the holy names of their
  superiors. Its highly ritualistic, and tend to take a long time.
  Their magick is almost completely ritual, and requires complete
  mastery of pronunciation and the secret names and titles of the
  spirits. In fact, they almost never use magick outside their
  temples. Instead they might send spirits or forces outside to
  perform tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their magick is rigid and somewhat clumsy, but its power
  cannot be denied. The hierarchy of spirits they work with can be
  extremely powerful, and tend to take an interest in the life of
  the magician if he displays enough power and knowledge. It is
  unwise to harm a enochian with powerful spirit friends. Many
  enochians have spirit mentors which teach the mage in the true
  meaning of the Plan. On the other hand, the mage is quite
  dependent on the spiritual hierarchy. If he loses contact with it
  or irritate the spirits, he may suffer horribly. All in all,
  enochians tend to do as the spirits say and the spirits do what
  the mage says. Both are anyway small cogs in the mighty Plan of
  The Highest.
    </p>
    <p>
     The enochians are solitary, and seldom involve themselves in
  the affairs of other traditions . They have some contact with
  groups in the Celestial Chorus, but that is just about all. Most
  of the time they tend to avoid contact with anyone, preferring to
  speak with the spirits. Old enochians are often disturbing and
  asocial even to mages, having spent more time communicating with
  spirits than with people. They tend to talk in a very formal way,
  as they are performing a magickal ritual, and they often think in
  terms a bit alien for most humans.
    </p>
    <p>
     One area enochian mages tend to be active in is the search for
  nodes and quintessence. They will use almost any means to gain
  control over nodes in order to turn them into temples for the
  enochian hierarchy. This is often the only time they clash with
  the other traditions. They also sometimes try to explain their
  vision to others, sometimes with surprising patience.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Philosophy
    </h2>
    We have seen a part of the Great Plan, and
  know our duty. We must obey the Plan and make the world ready for
  the next step in evolution, regardless of personal pain or
  danger. We must strive to understand the Plan every moment, both
  in our hearts and our minds. Soon the time of testing will come,
  the time when the barriers which imprison humanity will fall and
  the elements will be set free. It will be a time of chaos,
  destruction and sacrifice, but we will lead humanity out of
  darkness into the blinding light of the higher spheres.
    <h2>
     Organisation
    </h2>
    None. Each enochian is working alone on his
  little part in the Great Plan. But they do keep in touch using
  the spirits, and often get their orders from
  ÓaboveÓ. In practice each enochian tend to know his
  place in the cosmic hierarchy, and become very irritated when
  someone or something overstep his bounds.
    <h2>
     Meetings
    </h2>
    None.
    <h2>
     Initiation
    </h2>
    Enochians seldom train apprentices. Most
  members are mages from the Order of Hermes or Celestial Chorus
  who have seen the enochian vision and joined. Some are orphans,
  who have contacted (or been contacted by) the enochian spirits
  themselves. They have never had any human mentor, and tend to be
  very strange.
    <h2>
     Chantry
    </h2>
    None. Many enochians search for nodes to build
  temples on. These are guarded by the most powerful spirits and
  forces the mage (and his assisting entities) can summon.
    <h2>
     Acolytes
    </h2>
    None. Enochian mages tend to be solitary. In the
  old times they often used a medium to speak with the spirits the
  mage summoned, but today the mage usually speaks with the spirits
  himself.
    <h2>
     Sphere
    </h2>
    Forces, Spirit or Prime (Almost all the other
  spheres are regarded as unimportant. The mage chooses one sphere
  as his speciality)
    <h2>

    Hermit, Weird Old Man, Ceremonial Magician.
    <h2>
     Foci
    </h2>
    <b>
     Enochian
    </b>
    : All spheres. This is a complex,
  powerful and secret language with its own alphabet. According to
  the enochians each letter contains enough power to shatter the
  world if pronounced the wrong way. All magick involving the
  spirits or the elements in any way must use one of the 48 keys,
  which must be memorised.
    <p>
     <b>
      Tablet of Union
     </b>
     : Forces, Life, Matter, Mind, Prime.
  This is a 4x5 square containing the four holy names of the
  elements. It is often written on a parchment or a metal tablet
  worn as a amulet.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      The Great Tablet
     </b>
     : Not really necessary for any sphere,
  but unless the mage has perfect memory he should have one. This
  is the tablet representing the structure of the universe. It is a
  27x25 square, containing all the holy names when read in the
  right directions.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Showstone
     </b>
     : Spirit, Time. Often a black mirror (or a
  crystal among the more conservative enochians). Enochians prefer
  to contact spirits through the mirror rather than summoning them
  directly, since the spirits are supposed to dislike appearing in
  material form.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Temple
     </b>
     : Spirit. Enochians use not only a circle, but
  need a whole room correctly consecrated, with the right incenses,
  the altar of exactly the right dimensions and the symbols on the
  walls drawn at the astrologically right moment. Often the
  elemental sub-tablets are hung on the walls, and the Great Tablet
  is placed at the altar. Before entering the temple the mage must
  purify himself, and inside enochians wear ceremonial robes.

     Quote
    </h2>
    "This I was told by the third archangel of Air in
  Fire: we must consecrate temples around the world to prepare for
  the day when the time is ready. That day the lines of force
  between them will burn through the barriers. That day the
  foundations will crumble. That day mankind will find its
  destiny."

      Our brothers and sisters have seen the Light, and a small
    part of the Plan. Unfortunately they have not yet realised that
    we must break free from our bonds to reach The Highest, not the
    other way around. Hopefully they will realise this, and join us

      Enochian mages tend to agree with the views of Order of
    Hermes on these traditions. Of course, most enochians prefer to
    avoid any contact as much as possible, so they seldom have any
    views at all.

     <a name="rotes">
      Example Rotes
     </a>
    </h2>
    <h3>
     Opening the four watchtowers (Spirit 3 Forces 2)
    </h3>
    The mage
  summon the powers of the four elements to protect him and his
  temple. As long as the mage stay inside the temple he is
  protected by the enochian hierarchy. Anything that happens inside
  the temple is known by the spirits, who may choose to intervene.
  They mostly use coincidental magick, but may in extreme cases
  choose to manifest
    <h3>
     Closing the veil of the temple (Mind 2 Prime 2)
    </h3>
    This rote
  is a often used way to protect the temple. The mage cloaks the
  temple in a veil of uninterest, and seal this by routing some of
  the temples quintessence into the veil. A person who don't know
  about the temple will simply not notice it, or remain
  uninterested. It will not protect from those who know of the
  temple, but even those will have some difficulty to find a way
  in.
    <h3>
     Contact spirit (Spirit 2)
    </h3>
    The mage summon the spirit by
  reading the first enochian key and another key relating to the
  spirits position in the hierarchy. If successful, the mage may
  communicate with the spirit through the showstone. This rote is
  very often used, but the mage must be powerful enough to impress
  the spirit. Most enochians start out with cacodaemons and the
  servant angels, and go on with the greater angels. All the
  following rotes use this method to perform magick.
    <h3>
     Manifest cacodaemon (Spirit 2 Matter 2 Prime 2)
    </h3>
    Allows a
    <a href="ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/magick/Enochian/cacodemo.gz">
     cacodaemon
    </a>
    to physically manifest. The mage reads one of the 48 keys, and
  draws the three letters of the demons name in the air while
  chanting the two secret names who rule over that daemon.
  Cacodaemons are generally not very intelligent, and somewhat
  lazy. They do not like to have anybody ordering them around, and
  would happily escape or hurt the mage if the threat of their
  superiors keep them in check. The daemons size and physical shape
  is up to itself, and often quite weird.
    <h3>
     Summon one of the sixty-four good angels most skilled and
  effective in medicine and the cure of sickness. (Spirit 2 Life 3
  or 4)
    </h3>
    The mage summons a healing angel in order to heal
  himself or another. If the angel choose to help depends upon the
  situation, the power of the summoner and if it was the correct
  angel for that type of wound or sickness. Each angel has its own
  speciality.
    <h3>
     Summon one of the sixteen good angels potent in changing of
  place (Spirit 2 Correspondence 3)
    </h3>
    The mage summons an angel
  who will transport him or somebody else to a desired place. Each
  angel is specialised in one kind of transport. For example, Tdim
  will perform transports over seas and water while Anaa can
  transport the mage to hot and sunny places (Hawaii or a desert).
    <h3>
     Summon one of the sixteen good angels skilled and potent in
  understanding the secrets of all men (Spirit 2 Mind 3)
    </h3>
    The
  mage summons an angel in order to gain information about
  somebody. The angel (if it was correctly summoned and the right
  angel for the job) will search out the individual, subtly read
  his mind and body and return with the requested information. They
  are also good at finding information about other things. Many
  enochians spend a lot of time conversing with these angels.
    <h3>
     Summon the mighty archangel Pziza of Fire of Fire and his
  four cherubic servitors (Spirit 2 Forces 3)
    </h3>
    The mage summons
  one of the archangels of pure fire. The archangel prefer not to
  manifest physically, but may perform services using its static
  magick. The mage should not summon Pziza lightly, since
  fire-angels tend to be impulsive and a bit aggressive. The
  archangel is very good at controlling the forces of fire, heat
  and destruction, if somewhat overeager to do so.
    <h3>
     Summon the mighty archangel Erzla of Air of Air and his four
  cherubic servitors (Spirit 2 Mind 4)
    </h3>
    The mage summons one of
  the archangels of pure air. The archangel tend to manifest
  mentally, speaking directly into the mages mind. Air-angels are
  quick, highly intelligent and curious, but have a short span of
  attention unless the mage have something interesting to say.
  Erzla is very good at explaining abstract theories and magick.
    <h3>
     Summon the mighty Lord Uolxdo of Earth of Fire, He whose name
  is Annihilation (Spirit 2 Forces 4 Entropy 3)
    </h3>
    The mage
  summons one of the Lords of Fire. If the Lord chooses to help the
  mage it can destroy almost anything or anyone, using its own
  considerable power or its servitors. This often happen using
  static magick. Typical effects is terrorist bombings, small
  earthquakes, traffic accidents, chemical explosions or riots. The
  targets demise is almost a certainty, since the Lord is known for
  his tenacity.
    <h3>
     Summon the Senior Lord of Saturn in Fire, Arinnap, He who
  Protects with a Sword. (Spirit 2 Forces 5 Prime 2 Entropy
  2)
    </h3>
    The mage summons one of the most powerful spirits in the
  hierarchy to protect him. Arinnap will, if the mage has a good
  reason, protect him from any harm. Anybody who tries to harm the
  mage in any way, even unintentional, will be slain by the Lord.
  This Lord is not to trifle with, and can be as dangerous for the
  mages friends as for his enemies.
