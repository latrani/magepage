Well, I don't know if these were the ones you were looking for, but here you
go.

"Whoaaa... I think I'm flying."
	Bob Rightlobe, _Tripping the Light Fantastic_

	While most other WW games can be simulated in Live-Action through
the use of costumes and minimal props, the vast challeneges presented by the
Mage system necessitate much more drastic steps to ensure complete immersion
in the genre.  Mage LARP players must satisfy some stiff prerequisites
before being allowed to play:

-- a Bachelor's Degree in Philosophy
-- a large bank account or very generous friends (only the 
	ST, really)
-- a history of delusional behavior _or_
-- a certification in Shamanic training _or_
-- proof of a month or longer stay in a Shao-lin or Shorenji-
	kempo oriented Zen monastery
-- understanding parents/friends/spouse/etc.

	In addition, it is recommended that Mage LARPers have non-permanent
jobs which will allow the player to move around quite a bit.

	Once players have been selected, you are almost ready to start the
game.  Have each of the players sign the following document in blood
(permission to photocopy granted).

	"I, ______________, do hereby attest that I was not in any way
coerced into playing this game, that I enter this game of my own free will
and sound mind, and accept the consequences of my actions, regardless of
what they might be.  I further attest that I will in no way implicate the
writers of this game, nor the Story Teller, in any deviant acts or property
damage that might result from my involvement in this game.

						Signed: _______________
						Date:   _______________

	Okay!  Now you're ready to play!

"I wouldn't recommend drugs or insanity for anyone, but, hey, for me they
worked."
	--Lou Williams, recovered

	The first step is to simulate the Awakening.  Once you start the
players into the world of Mage, you won't be able to RP the period prior to
the Awakening again, so make their mortal time count.  We recommend
harrassing phone calls in the middle of the night and anonymous accusations
of terrorist activity mailed to the player's place of employment.
	Once the characters have begun to suspect that something is going
wrong, step up the process.  To simulate the harried and paranoid
environment of the world of Mage, have the players drink several cups of
espresso before each session.  Any players whose hands are not shaking after
half an hour should then consume enough Vivarin to kill a horse.  (Note:
should you experience constipation or loss of appetite, you're on the right
track.)  Once the players begin jumping at shadows in the corners of their
eyes, you can begin simulating Technocracy intereference in their lives.
Have the players sit down in front of a television and watch eight hours of
Community Television and C-Span to guide their increasing paranoia.

"Gimme a red, gimme a red."
	--Nuke, "Daredevil"

	At some point the players are going to start coming down from their
very legal caffeine high.  Consult the alt.drugs.availability FAQ (updated
weekly) to find the source nearest you.  Have your players consume mass
amounts of amphetamines to boost up their doubtlessly flagging energy.  For
short, aggressive games, crack cocaine may be substituted for amphetamines.
	The game should now be progressing at a rapid pace, although there
may be many interruptions.  To prepare the players for the next stage, mix
several doses of liquid LSD into a blue kool-aid drink and serve to the
players.  Inform them that reality may be shifting very soon, and that they
should be making preparations for The Shift.
	Things you can do to increase the pace:  Read Kafka out loud,
especially _Metamorphosis_; show "Fantasia"; play chess, but use
sleight-of-hand to move the pieces when the players aren't looking; play the
17 minute version of "An I Godda Devida" by Iron Butterfly.

****

"For those of you on acid, yes, the screen really did just melt."
	--Running commentary, "Rocky Horror Picture Show"

	About a half an hour after having the players drink the kool-aid,
encourage them to try out their new-found abilities.  Time should dilate and
contract, as should the walls.  Pictures may talk.  The music contains
hidden messages.  Allow the players to explore their surroundings for about
five hours, then begin the paranoia again by playing taped police broadcasts
from hidden speakers in the room.  Play "A Clockwork Orange" constantly on
the TV.  Turn up the blue and red bubblegum machines.
	Your players may feel the urge to fly, but you should remind them
that flight is a high level power and that they probably haven't mastered it
yet.  Those who insist will be rewarded by gravity, the hardest
paradox-master of them all.
	Remember to award experience points liberally, but give the players
a chance to advance.  In fact, the players should be approaching high levels
of Quiet by the tenth hour of kool-aid time.  Now administer the peyote
buttons and push them over the edge.  Make sure each player is resting
comfortably on the pillows as they take the buttons; they may experience
temporary loss of bodily control slightly after.  Players who are starting
to lose energy should also take more amphetamines.

****

"I am a god!  I can do anything!  I can-- hey, is that a peanut-butter
sandwich?"
	--Ben Hutton, god and epicure

	Once the buttons take effect, allow the players to step outside and
experience the world from a new philosophical perspective.  Readings from
Berkeley, Teillhard, and Pirsig should be alternated with readings from
HSThompson, Phillip K. Dick, and Thomas Pynchon.  Keep the players away from
the neighbors.

****

"Oh, Mama, I'm in fear for my life from the long arm of the law."
	--Styx, "Renegade"

	If the neighbors do see your activities, don't worry.  Most citizens
will simply believe you are part of an SCA re-enactment, and will attempt to
ignore you.  If you see a cop, walk quickly and calmly away.  (Remind the
players that the cops work for the Technocracy.)

****

"You took too much, your brain is toast, braintoast!"
	--Unknown, "Braintoast"

	If your players have escaped detection this far, congratulations,
but please remember that every good campaign has an end.  Make yours as
climatic as possible by introducing the players to datura and dropping them
off in front of the police station.
	Be sure to visit your players from time to time in the institution.

Um, in case any of you haven't figured it out yet, I am not even the
slightest, eensy-weensiest bit serious.  'Course, you knew that, right?  To
put it even more simply:  

	DON'T DO THIS!!!
