  <h1>
   Organisation
  </h1>
  The chantry is controlled by its statutes.
  The original statutes (in Latin) are written into a black tome,
  with the symbol of the Guild of Mercury on its cover and the
  founding year 1346 on the spine. Since then they have been
  modified slightly 1573, the modern organisation was added 1778
  and 1900. The last change was 1970, when several old rules and
  offices of no importance was removed and many rules simplified.
  Beside the statutes, there are other subordinate rules collected
  into the Praxis and the guild-specific Guild Covenants. Finally,
  there are the collected decisions and announcements of the
  chantry throughout the times collected into Minnesböcker
  ("Books of Memory"), so far 231 (but many have been lost). These
  rules explain, amend and modify the main rules which can only be
  changed after the acceptance by the full Chantry Meeting on three
  consecutive Christmases.
  <p>
   The chantry is quite centralised, with the Alderman having a
  very broad jurisdiction. Originally he was the oldest member of
  the Guild of Mercury, but today the current Nämdeman of the
  Guild replaces the Alderman when he dies or retires. As a sign of
  his office he wears a ceremonial Seal of Solomon made of crystal
  (an extremely valuable gift from a Russian chantry, which gave it
  to Convivo Holmiensis during the 18th century).
  </p>
  <p>
   The Nämdemän are chosen among the masters of each
  Guild, usually on the retirement, death or appointment as
  Alderman by the current Nämdeman. It is formally possible
  for the Masters of a Guild to outvote the current Nämdeman,
  but the Guild Meeting can void the decision. Originally there
  were four Nämdemän, two from each guild, but when the
  Guild of Bacchus joined they were reduced to three, one from each
  Guild. The Nämdeman of the Guild of Vulcanus is also titled
  Mästermekanikus (Mastermechanicus) and wears their seal as a
  symbol of his or her office. The Nämdemän are the
  leaders of their respective Guilds, and usually have great
  influence over them.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Guild Meetings are called by the Alderman, and usually
  done behind closed doors in his office. However, some meetings
  are of official or of ceremonial nature, like courts or the
  Christmas Ceremonies. In these meetings the Alderman has the
  final vote in anything. They don't have to include all
  Nämdemän to be justified, but the decision of a meeting
  with fewer present Nämdemän can be overruled by another
  meeting with more present.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Guild Meetings can also function as courts, where disputes
  between mages or severe internal problems are resolved (in
  simpler cases the Alderman or an Nämdeman can handle it
  themselves). The problem is debated before the chantry, and the
  Alderman gives the verdict. This type of meetings also preside
  over questions, suggestions and petitions from the mages, and
  over the tests of Apprenticehood, Gesällhood and Masterhood.
  When an open meeting is in session, at least five guildhosts
  should be present in their ceremonial dark blue uniforms from the
  15th century, complete with swords. All mages with insignia (like
  the Seal of the Alderman or the Key of the Forcemaster) must have
  them visible during the meeting.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beside the Alderman and Nämdemän, there are many
  other offices:
  </p>
  <p>
   The Forcemaster is responsible for the upkeep of the nodes of
  the chantry, its wards and the high ceremonies. It is required
  that he is a full Master of his Guild and a Master of Prime. He
  may not hold any other office during his appointment (usually for
  life). He has extensive duties: to protect and preserve the
  stores of Quintessence, to celebrate certain ceremonies during
  eclipses and equinoxes, control the wards and in lead the yearly
  Christmas celebrations. He may demand help from other mages to
  fulfil his duties, and nobody can deny him assistance. On the
  other hand, the statutes specify severe punishments for
  Forcemasters who are lax or incompetent in their duties. When a
  Forcemaster is appointed, he will receive the elaborate silver
  key to the Temple (his insignum) and the ancient Forcemaster
  Tome, containing the notes of all previous Forcemasters and the
  secret words to control the wards and nodes.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Magister is responsible for all education in the chantry
  and as scribe in official matters. By the statutes the oldest
  mage in the chantry is appointed as Magister and given his
  insignia: a silver- tipped feather pen and a double ink well,
  containing black and red ink prepared by the Librarian. It is his
  duty to oversee education in the chantry, approve apprentices, to
  test apprentices and students, to write changes of membership,
  punishments and offices into the Scroll of Membership and to
  regulate access to the library. All of the Scrolls of Membership
  since the founding of the chantry are kept in a small vault in
  the office of the Magister, and would provide fascinating
  historical documents if he ever let anybody see them except at
  ceremonial occasions. Beside the names of all mages are a small
  dot of their blood and remarks and titles; positive things
  written in black, punishments and criticism written in red. A few
  names have been inked out in red.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Alderman, Forcemaster and Magister all have great power in
  different areas. The Alderman has the greatest authority, but the
  Forcemaster can often overrule him in matters of the magickal
  state of the chantry and ceremony. The Magister can have variable
  power, depending on how strictly he interprets the statutes. If
  they are followed in detail (as the current Magister usually
  does) the Magister will gain much power, since practically all
  advancement in the chantry requires his approval and he can
  easily refuse it.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beside the central offices of Alderman, Forcemaster, Magister
  and Nämdeman, there are many lesser offices. A person can
  hold several offices, except the Alderman, Forcemaster and
  Magister, who may only hold their own.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Housemaster is responsible for the physical status of the
  chantry, repairs of the building, to direct the servants and keep
  the central keys. He is usually the chief servant, but has been a
  mage in the distant past. The insignia of the Housemaster is a
  huge key-ring made of rusty iron, reputedly the original key-ring
  of the building.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Librarian is responsible for the library. He is also
  responsible for the paper supply, making parchments and ink. The
  last generations the title has been passed down in the family
  Ulv, each Librarian passing down his secrets to his successor.
  The insignum of the Librarian is the Index, a huge tome
  (possibly) cataloguing all books.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Treasurer is responsible for the economy of the chantry
  (he has in the past often been Housemaster too). He plans the
  finances of the chantry and keeps the cash in a special safe and
  in the Guild- chests (a certain percentage of the wealth of the
  chantry must be kept in cash due to old praxis). The Treasurer
  must be able to review the finances for the Alderman. The
  insignum of the Treasurer is the golden key to the safe, and he
  has the right to order gärdemännen (the tax
  collectors).
  </p>
  <p>
   The Gärdemän are responsible for the payment and
  collections of taxes, charges and fines. They are usually
  servants or the apprentices of the Treasurer.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Weaponsmaster is responsible for the physical safety of
  the chantry and punishments. He shall lead the chantry-hosts and
  other possible guards, and have the right to demand defensive
  duty of other mages if the situation demands it. He is also
  supposed to keep the armoury in fine shape (if he haven't got an
  armourer), train guards and make sure nothing threatens the
  chantry. He can appoint apprentices without any other office as
  chantry-hosts if he has too few to fulfil his duties, both
  temporary and indefinitely. The Weaponsmaster has his quarters by
  the courtyard, connected to the guardhouse and the armoury. His
  insignum is a ceremonial sword of copper with the inscription
  "Per Vim Martiis" (possibly an talisman).
  </p>
  <p>
   The chantry-hosts are responsible for guarding the chantry and
  keeping order. They are to make sure no intruders get in, that
  nobody misbehaves in the chantry and protect mages who need it.
  They are also often used today to lift and move heavy
  objects.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Laboratorymaster is responsible for the upkeep of the
  laboratories and ceremonial rooms. He sees to that the
  laboratories are well stocked, clean, ordered, that they are not
  misused or damaged. He is also responsible for the smithy and
  workshop.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Lanternbearer is subordinate to the Forcemaster and has as
  his duty to transport Tass to the chantry, where the Forcemaster
  stores it. He is also responsible for finding new sources of
  Quintessence, protect the, and keep the chantry well lit in the
  dark season and make sure the fires are burning safely. By
  tradition the office goes to the apprentices of the Forcemasters,
  if there are any. At the appointment, the Lanternbearer receives
  an old lantern, lit by the fire from the Temple.
  </p>
  <p>
   The ordinary mages of the chantry are divided into Apprentices
  (also called Lärlingar), Gesälls and Masters, which
  roughly correspond to the normal division into disciples, adepts
  and masters. Apprentices still study under a Master, while the
  Gesälls are much more independent. To advance, a mage must
  pass certain tests and successfully defend a thesis (see the
  section about initiation). Only the Masters have real political
  power, although Gesälls and even apprentices can have
  certain offices.
