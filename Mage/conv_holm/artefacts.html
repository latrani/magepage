  <h1>
   Artefacts of the Chantry
  </h1>
  During its history the chantry
  has gathered numerous magickal artefacts and tomes (and
  unfortunately lost quite a few). Beside those talismans owned by
  individual mages, there are many owned by the Chantry and the
  Guilds.
  <p>
   <a href="Mage/conv_holm/location_building.html#LIBRARY">
    The Library
   </a>
   is filled with treasures for anybody willing to
  spend a long time searching. It is very complete in certain
  areas, and strangely deficient in others. This is mainly due to
  the sad fact that many of the books from the two oldest Summers
  have been scattered or destroyed, and only random parts of the
  original library remain. Generally, there is a lot of hermetic
  texts, but they are quite incomplete in certain areas. The
   <a href="Mage/alchemy.html">
    alchemical
   </a>
   and
   <a href="Mage/goetics.html">
    goetic
   </a>
   sections are quite well-stocked, while the
   <a href="Mage/roci2.html">
    Rosicrucian
   </a>
   section show signs that many texts have been
  removed. On the religious side, there are many non-magickal texts
  but few real tomes. On the other hand, the section of books
  relating to the activities of the School of Swedenborg is
  smaller, but very complete. There are very few documents
  pertaining to the Guild of Bacchus. Different spheres are also
  represented more or less. There is quite a bit about Forces,
  Matter and Prime, but very little about Correspondence, Entropy
  and Time.
  </p>
  <p>
   When it comes to other lores, the library is a veritable
  treasure. The collection of observations and books about the
  Faerie is in fact the largest in the world except for the main
  library of the Arcanum (ironically, few of the mages at the
  chantry take any interest in them). The library also have many
  detailed references about the Garou and the old Norse myths, but
  almost completely lacks information about vampires and ghosts. In
  mundane matters, it is mediocre and often quite dated. The only
  exceptions are the collection of historical documents (which in
  fact traces the evolution of the Swedish Technocracy the last 400
  years quite well) and a small up-to-date scientific library.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beside the open library, there is also the closed library,
  usually called the Master Room. Here the most advanced texts are
  stored, together with texts which has been thought dangerous for
  apprentices to study. This includes several goetic summonings,
  some mystical texts and many documents pertaining to the real
  history of the chantry. On a reading table lies the classic
   <i>
    Ars Magna et Ultima
   </i>
   by Clavius and the unexpurgated
   <i>
    Tabula Smaragdina
   </i>
   by Hermes Trismegistros, often
  referenced by the Guild of Mercury. Inside the room there is also
  a locked cabinet made of iron containing truly restricted books.
  To read them the approval from the Magister, Forcemaster and
  Alderman is required. What is inside nobody knows, except
  possibly the Librarian.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beside the books, the library contains numerous more or less
  interesting talismans. A large cabinet houses the
   <a href="Mage/curiosa.txt">
    Andreas Arenamontanus collection
   </a>
   of curious magickal objects
  and his book about them (many talismans are now missing). They
  are seldom useful, but often quite amusing or puzzling. They
  range from simple toys (like a box which makes people forget
  anything which is put into it) to talismans which apparently
  contradict known laws of magick, like a lead cube filled with
  true Nothingness. On the library shelves various more or less
  strange objects are placed, like old hourglasses, strange fossils
  or ornate statuettes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other artefacts are placed around the chantry, and are too
  numerous to count. One artefact is the telescope in
   <a href="Mage/conv_holm/location_building.html#TOWER">
    the tower
   </a>
   . Its a Swedenborgian construction, and able to see
  not only the stars but also the Umbra. This is just known by
   <a href="Mage/conv_holm/members.html#RYGER">
    Ryger
   </a>
   , who isn't telling anybody. The lantern of the
  lantern-bearer is able to absorb free quintessence and release it
  in the Temple. The sword of the Weaponsmaster doubtless contains
  martial magick.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another of the major objects is the Sword of
   <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd.dir/paracelsus.dir/paracelsus_1.html">
    Paracelsus
   </a>
   , which hangs above the fireplace in the banquet
  hall. Originally it belonged to the executioner at the Bloodbath
  of Stockholm 1520, but Paracelsus (who visited the chantry right
  then) managed to buy it. Since it had killed around 80 nobles
  that day, he realised that it had become a quite powerful
  artefact. He mainly used it for experimental entropy and life
  magick, not to mention to show off during his travels around
  Europe. After his death in a barroom brawl, the sword passed from
  alchemist to alchemist on the continent until it was given as a
  gift to Alderman Prahler by the Order of the Blinding Sun.
  Although most mages of the chantry realise that its a very nice
  foci for Life and Entropy, nobody knows its real importance. It
  is a fetter of one of the most powerful wraiths of Stockholm
  (once one of the nobles killed at the Bloodbath), who seeks to
  protect and control it (not to mention make sure the mages never
  realise its true importance). It can subtly influence events and
  people around the sword, and would immediately notice if anybody
  used it. Right now it hangs over the fireplace in the
   <a href="Mage/conv_holm/location_building.html#BANQUET_HALL">
    Banquet Hall

   .
