  <h1>
   Rules, Rights and Responsibilities
  </h1>
  <h2>
   Rights
  </h2>
  The rules of the Convivo Holmiensis are
  labyrinthine and contradictory. Only very experienced Masters
  understand all their implications, and most Masters just know
  about the most common applications. The Guilds of Vulcanus and
  Bacchus are also more liberal, and ignore many of the older and
  more baroque rules (to the irritation of the Conservatives). In
  short the rules boil down to: the Masters have all the power, the
  Gesälls some and the apprentices none.
  <p>
   Masters have very extensive rights, although many of them are
  very seldom used today. They have unlimited access to the library
  and the laboratories (conflicts are resolved by the Librarian or
  Laboratorymaster, who are sovereign in these matters). They have
  the right to ask the Forcemaster for Tass, the Housemaster for
  working space and the Treasurer for financing of expenses. They
  have the right to sit at the end of the tables in the Banquet
  hall closest to the fireplace or the windows, and everybody has
  to give them place if they wish so. They have also the right to
  demand that the Lanternbearer follow them if they are to walk
  through darkness (like in the cellar or during the night). They
  have the right to commander five servants for help, and can ask
  for more from their Nämdeman. They also can demand magickal
  help of three apprentices or one Gesäll. They have always
  the right to talk to the Alderman. They have the right to larger
  living space if they are living at the chantry. Masters can call
  for a meeting of their Guild, where their Nämdeman presides.
  They have the right to read the entire statutes and all other
  documents in their Guild-chest, including the memorybooks and
  other historical documents.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gesälls have access to the Library or laboratories if
  their requests has been granted by the Librarian or
  Laboratorymaster. They can ask the Forcemaster for small amounts
  of Tass, but has to have a good reason (usually this is done for
  thesis research). They have the right to demand assistance of one
  servant for a task. They always have the right to talk to their
  Nämdeman, and can demand a living space or other room in the
  chantry for their own use. They have the right to read the
  original statutes under the supervision of their Nämdeman,
  Magister or the Librarian.
  </p>
  <p>
   Apprentices have the right to use the library if their
  requests has been granted by the Magister, Librarian and their
  Masters. They have always the right to talk to their Master. They
  have the right to read the apprentice version of the statutes
  (which is simplified and shortened).
  </p>
  <h2>
   Responsibilities
  </h2>
  Masters must obey their
  Nämdemän and the Alderman in all matters, and the other
  offices within their domains. They have to treat the
  Nämdemän and Alderman with respect and courtesy.
  <p>
   Gesälls has to obey the Masters and all superiors. They
  of course have to treat all of them with respect. A Master have
  the right to request their help, unless the Nämdeman of the
  apprentice interferes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Apprentices have to obey and respect the Gesälls, Masters
  and the Chief of the servants. A Master can demand their help,
  and have to obey unless their Masters ask their Nämdeman to
  annul the order. They can also be deputised as Guild Hosts by the
  Weaponsmaster (this cannot be overruled by anyone).
  </p>
  <h2>
   Justice
  </h2>
  In every conflict between mages the parts have
  the right to demand a trial by the Guild Meeting. It can decide
  on punishment (not only for the accused but also for the accuser,
  if it finds it necessary). Apprentices will have their Master as
  advocate, while Gesälls and Masters have the right to
  appoint their own advocates within their Guild (there were
  specialised lawyers within the chantry once). If somebody chooses
  an advocate or representative the meeting will automatically
  become open (unless the Alderman overrules this). The trial
  proceeds in about the same way as a normal trial, with the
  Alderman as judge. The Weaponsmaster must be present to execute
  the judgement.
  <p>
   The Protocols are important, and form the foundation of the
  decisions. They are inscribed on the plaquet by the entrance to
  the library, on a parchment in the chest of the Guild of Vulcanus
  and in the Guild Oath. In addition, the Statutes and Praxis
  modify them a bit, not to mention the old prejudices. The first
  part, about respect, is important and usually enforces strictly
  by the Guild of Mercury. In the rules there are many detailed
  descriptions of how insubordination should be punished.
  </p>
  <p>
   The second Protocol is complex. The Statutes demand that an
  apprentice should repay his tuition to his Master and Guild. This
  can be done in many ways, but payment has to be acknowledged by
  the Magister. Since no Oracles have ever appeared at the chantry,
  the fourth Protocol is never invoked.
  </p>
  <p>
   The security of the chantry is extremely important, and is
  surrounded by an impenetrable jungle of paragraphs. Everyone
  risking it will be punished. To leave information which could
  give others indications to its existence or location is illegal.
  Its also illegal to approach the chantry without making sure
  nobody is following. To interact with the Technocracy or other
  enemies is of course also a crime, unless the defendant was on a
  diplomatic mission or can show that it was entirely to the good
  of the chantry and with absolutely no risks involved.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is not allowed for a member to break the profane or
  ecclesiastical laws (there have been no difference between them
  since the late Middle Ages) except in certain circumstances. It
  is allowed to commit crimes to protect the chantry, to prevent
  the revelation as a mage or to interfere with Technocracy
  activities, as long as it doesn't go to excess. There are however
  a few special cases: blasphemy will not be tolerated, while
  revolution and crimes against the crown are regarded as
  irrelevant.
  </p>
  <p>
   Magick is strictly regulated. Misuse of magick is not allowed.
  Magick hurting or removing people's free will is also not
  allowed. To use magick for mundane purposes is not forbidden, but
  regarded as bad taste (still, most mages use it in this way). All
  magick which could hurt the reputation or security of the chantry
  is forbidden. To use magick in such a way that reality is
  endangered is also forbidden, as is bringing large amounts of
  Paradox, destructive forces, malevolent spirits and unknown
  talismans into the chantry. To use magick against another mage of
  the chantry is not allowed except if he gives his direct
  permission for the act or the magick is of obviously positive
  effect and the other mage unable to respond.
  </p>
  <p>
   A member of the chantry must also use his magick to help and
  protect the sleepers, but without revealing himself. All threats
  against the sleepers or reality must be prevented if
  possible.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Punishments
  </h2>
  The punishments vary quite a bit. Many are
  quite old:
  <p>
   <a name="RED_PAINTED">
    The
   </a>
   most common punishment is a
  warning, which is entered by the Magister into the Scroll of
  Membership with red ink (this has led to the expression "Red
  Painted Apprentice" for insubordinate mages).
  </p>
  <p>
   Fines are common, usually money, Tass, books or talismans.
  They go to the chantry or the accusing part. If the guilty part
  cannot pay, he will be formally subjugated until he can pay, or
  the Guild Meeting can demand a service as payment (in the case of
  heavier fines this service can be quite large and hard).
  </p>
  <p>
   Subjugation is a kind of demotion, where the guilty part
  looses the rights of his normal rank (a subjugated Master have
  the same rights as an Gesäll, while a subjugated apprentice
  has no rights at all). Since a title can never be revoked (or
  rather, the process is so cumbersome it has never been used),
  they are still titled Masters, Gesälls or Apprentices, but
  with the addition of "Subjugated" ("Subjugated Master" etc.).
  </p>
  <p>
   Isolation means that the guilty part during a certain period
  is not allowed to visit the chantry or interact with its members
  (who themselves risk punishment if they deal with the isolated).
  The length of this punishment can vary between a month and a
  lifetime.
  </p>
  <p>
   Apprentices or servants can be flogged by the Weaponsmaster
  using the Chantry Whip (normally kept in his quarters).
  </p>
  <p>
   If someone misuses his office, he will be forced to leave it
  and the guilty person will not be allowed into it for a certain
  time (in the case of the office of Forcemaster, this is a
  lifetime).
  </p>
  <p>
   Imprisonment in the cells in the cellar is possible, usually
  as punishment for serious crimes among the servants but mages can
  in principle be imprisoned too.
  </p>
  <p>
   If the crime is against the Protocols, the aura of the guilty
  part should be marked with a symbol. This is however never
  applied except in theory.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expulsion is possible for severe crimes. The tongue, hands and
  mind of the guilty are magickally locked so that he will never be
  able to reveal anything about the chantry. If necessary, he is
  given over to profane or ecclesiastical authorities.
