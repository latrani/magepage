  <h1>
   Mood
  </h1>
  Life at the Convivo Holmiensis is claustrophobic.
  The dark, narrow hallways twist through the chantry as if they
  tried to escape the outside. Windows are small and deep, not
  letting in enough light. It is closed to the outside world, and
  won't let it in. Everyone inside feels the urge to step out and
  breathe the free air, but at the same time fear it. Those who
  dare open up the chantry are branded as dangerous and security
  risks.
  <p>
   Convivo Holmiensis is wrapped in the spiderweb of
  traditionalism and bureaucratic formalism. Changes are seen as
  too dangerous to undertake unless they has been carefully
  analysed according to the rules, which can take ages. Everyone
  has to compromise to get anything done, leaving everybody unhappy
  and nothing really solved. Everyone is woven into a complex web
  of loyalties and organisation, making it hard to do anything
  without stepping on somebody's toes.

   However, while the chantry is filled to the attic with
  intrigues and ancient feuds, they are expressed completely
  different from what most other mages would expect. Everything is
  handled in a typical Swedish way, and the classic back-stabbing
  and conspiracies are unheard of. Instead the mages openly agree
  that they have differences, and then sit down at the meeting
  table and try to discuss them. This doesn't mean backstabbing
  doesn't occur, but it takes the form of mages changing sides in
  crucial votes, negative comments, bureaucratic delays and social
  ostracism.
