  <h2>
   The Palme Assassination
  </h2>
  Who killed Prime Minister Olof
  Palme in March 1985? The murder is still unsolved, despite many
  attempts at finding the killer and even a series of trials of one
  suspect. Was it really the work of a madman, as the police
  claims? Or was it political terrorism? Or is there a deeper, more
  disturbing reason?
  <p>
   The killing took place on Sveav√§gen, the main ley-line of
  the Technocracy, just on the border of their domain. Its
  proximity to the glass monolith could have formed a psychic
  resonance which spread across the nation. Was it planned by
  someone to shock the people of Sweden out of their placidity? Was
  it an attempt to repeat the ancient tradition of sacrificing the
  king to ensure fertility and power for the nation, or to attack
  the paradigm?
  </p>
  <p>
   Afterwards, several groups have profited. The faction within
  the New World Order which were behind the political system, the
   <a href="Mage/social_engineers.html">
    Social Engineers
   </a>
   found that their reality had begun to crack.
  Instead the Syndicate and hard-liners within the NWO gained
  power. Was it a Syndicate assassination? Or did one or more mages
  of the Convivo Holmiensis attempt to repeat the assassination of
  king Gustaf III?

  <h2>
   The JAS Gripen Affair
  </h2>
  The JAS 47 Gripen fighter jet
  developed by SAAB is one of the most technically advanced planes
  ever built, relying completely on computer control and guidance.
  Despite protests from many groups the corporation and the Swedish
  military have managed to continue the expensive and controversial
  project (Some claim its because the high level executives and the
  previous Minister of Defence are members of the same Masonic
  lodge).
  <p>
   The project has been hurt by accidents. The first crash
  happened during a test flight, where the pilot lost control
  during landing and the plane crashed. Unfortunately, the whole
  crash was filmed and the images of the plane plowing into the
  ground were spread worldwide. After a lengthy investigation, the
  project could continue. But during an air-show on the 1993
   <a href="http://www.sunet.se/stockholm/waterfestival.html">
    Stockholm
  Water Festival
   </a>
   , the pilot lost control again, and the fighter
  crashed spectacularly in front of tens of thousands of onlookers,
  fortunately without any injuries to anyone. This time the crash
  was filmed by several amateurs, and yet again the critique and
  public ridicule rose to a roar. Is someone sabotaging the
  project? But who? The traditions? The Syndicate? Someone
  else?

  <h2>
   The Miracles of Stockholm
  </h2>
  In the southern suburbs of
  Stockholm a few years back, the assyrian-orthodox girl Samira
  began performing miracles. An icon began to ooze holy oil in her
  presence, and the oil apparently healed people who came to her.
  The whole story got some media attention before being forgotten
  again. Was she an orphan Celestial Chorist? And what happened to
  her? Was she replaced by a Progenitor Clone?
  <h2>
   The Rise of Violence
  </h2>
  The amount of violence has risen
  recently. Although some experts claim its just that the media
  report it more and that it has become more brutal, most people
  feel its presence. Is this just a natural sleeper reaction to
  Technocracy tyranny, or is there something else behind it? Maybe
  the NWO hard-liners are arranging random violence and serial
  killings just to make people demand stronger police, more severe
  punishments for criminals and stronger societal control over
  people. Or perhaps there are somebody out there who seeks to
  undermine the stability of society?
