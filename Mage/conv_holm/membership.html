  <h1>
   Membership and Initiation
  </h1>
  Membership of the chantry is
  not easily attained. The normal procedure works as follows:
  <p>
   A Master of the chantry reports to the Magister that he has
  found a suitable candidate, and requests that he may begin his
  training. The Magister may study the candidate and arrange subtle
  tests to see if he appears promising. If the Magister gives his
  approval, the Master can begin magickal training. Otherwise, he
  is not allowed to teach any secrets to him. The decision of the
  Magister can not be overruled by anyone, and he may take an
  indefinite time to test the candidate if he so wishes.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Master trains the candidate, teaching the basic abilities
  of magick and lores. He is not allowed to tell anything about the
  chantry or the existence of other mages, except possibly the
  danger of the Technocracy. When the Master judges the candidate
  ready, he will request Magister for a Testing to take place. The
  Magister may refuse and demand further training, although this is
  rare. He also decides a date when the Test will take place, and
  its location.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the time of the Testing, the candidate is brought by his
  Master to a place where no sleepers usually go, like a parking
  lot in a industrial zone or the roof of a big building. At
  sunset, the Magister and four mages in black robes appear, and
  the testing begins. The Magister draws a circle on the ground,
  orders the candidate to step in and instructs him that he may not
  leave the circle
   <i>
    for any reason
   </i>
   until sunrise. Then each
  of the mages tries to make the candidate leave the circle, using
  their arts.
  </p>
  <p>
   The exact methods vary depending on the candidate. Some of the
  most used tricks include:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    One robed mage picks up some gravel, and spreads it with
    his hand. The candidate feels a horrible itching spread over
    his body, which only decrease when he moves towards the edge of
    the circle.
   </li>
   <li>
    One mage pours some sulphur and some iron on the ground,
    and ignites the mixture. It starts to burn fiercely, and a
    small pile of burning chemicals slowly crawl towards the
    candidate, filling the air with acrid smoke and sending painful
    sparks in all directions. The candidate has to evade it without
    leaving the circle.
   </li>
   <li>
    The pile suddenly jumps into the air and explodes into a
    burning fireball. The fireball is just a very realistic
    illusion.
   </li>
   <li>
    Several birds start to attack the candidate, picking at his
    eyes and screeching at him.
   </li>
   <li>
    One of the mages reaches out in the air, grabs it, and
    start to move his hand towards himself. The circle appear to
    move in the same way, but it is really an illusion.
   </li>
  </ul>
  If the candidate manages this part of the test, the Magister
  and his mages leave. The candidate has to remain inside the
  circle all night, despite many temptations to leave. He will
  notice that a basket with his favourite food and drink are placed
  a bit away. Sudden illusions may assault him. Convincing
  representatives for the Technocracy, Marauders or Nephandi may
  appear and try to seduce the candidate away from the Traditions.
  A spirit may deposit a jewel just outside the circle. The
  Magister watches everything, and will note any transgressions.
  <p>
   Shortly before sunrise, the Master will appear, happily
  congratulating him to succeeding the test. He will imply that it
  doesn't matter that the sun isn't really up yet, and try to make
  the candidate step out of the circle.
  </p>
  <p>
   If this doesn't succeed, he will leave the candidate again.
  Instead the police or some representative of the authorities will
  appear. They will accuse the candidate of trespassing on private
  property or something similar, and demand that he follow them.
  The important thing about this part of the test is not slavishly
  remaining inside the circle, but to handle the authorities
  smoothly without revealing too much about the true state of
  affairs.
  </p>
  <p>
   If the candidate manages to delay until sunrise, he has
  succeeded at then test. The Magister and Master will congratulate
  him, and the Magister has to designate a date within a year when
  the candidate can be initiated into the chantry.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the initiation, the candidate is brought to the chantry.
  All mages solemnly gather in the Banquet Hall, where the Alderman
  presides together with the Nämdemän and the Magister.
  The Magister proclaims: "
   <i>
    NN, who now stands before the duly
  gathered meeting of the Guilds of Convivo Holmiensis, has passed
  the Test. Does the Alderman accept that he will be taken as
  apprentice by Master NN of the Guild of XX?
   </i>
   ". The Alderman
  acknowledges. The Magister asks the Master: "
   <i>
    Do you accept NN
  as your apprentice, to teach him the secrets of your guild and
  accept him as your responsibility?
   </i>
   ". The Master acknowledges.
  The Magister asks the candidate: "
   <i>
    Candidate NN, do you wish to
  join the Guild of XX, with NN as your Master?
   </i>
   ". The candidate
  acknowledges. The Magister then asks him to read the initiation
  oath:
  </p>
  <p>
   "
   <i>
    I hereby swear in the presence of the Guild Meeting, the
  undivided forces and the Lord of the Universe to follow the
  statutes, rules and praxis of Convivo Holmiensis.
   </i>
  </p>
  <p class="c1">
   I swear that I will never reveal the existence of
  this chantry, name, position or activity.
  </p>
  <p class="c1">
   I swear to obey my superiors.
  </p>
  <p class="c1">
   I swear never to misuse the gift I have been
  bestowed.
  </p>
  <p class="c1">
   I swear to uphold the ancient protocols:
  </p>
  <dl>
   <dd class="c2">
    to respect those older and wiser than me.
   </dd>
   <dd class="c2">
    to repay my Master and Guild for my
    tuition.
   </dd>
   <dd class="c2">
    to never break my word.
   </dd>
   <dd class="c2">
    to never betray my guild-brothers or the
    chantry.
   </dd>
   <dd class="c2">
    to never have any contact with the enemies of
    Ascension and
   </dd>
   <dd class="c2">
    to always protect the unenlightened and follow
    their mundane laws.
   </dd>
  </dl>
  <p>
   <i>
    I swear that if I ever break this oath in any word or act,
  I will be expelled from my Guild and Convivo Holmiensis and all
  the unbalanced forces of the universe will be free to rip my
  body, spirit and soul apart. This I swear before the Guild
  Meeting, the undivided forces and the Lord of the Universe by my
  name and my blood.
   </i>
   "
  </p>
  <p>
   The Magister writes the name of the candidate on the
  membership scroll, adds any comments about the outcome of the
  Test in red ink, and then pricks the thumb of the candidate with
  his quill. He places a drop of blood at the name, and proclaims:
  "
   <i>
    Let it hereby be known, that today NN has become apprentice
  of the Guild of XX, in accordance with the statutes and
  praxis!
   </i>
   ". He gives the apprentice a copper coin, and a
  general celebration ensues, where everybody congratulates the
  apprentice and his Master.
  </p>
  <p>
   To become an Gesäll of the chantry, the apprentice has to
  prove that he has assimilated the teachings of his Master and
  Guild. When the apprentice feels he has learned enough, he can
  ask his Master to become Gesäll. The Master in turn asks the
  Magister, who (if he agrees) schedules an examination. The
  apprentice has to demonstrate his abilities (usually through some
  kind of demonstration) before the Guild Meeting. The three
  Nämdemän then asks a question each about the theory of
  magick (usually prepared beforehand, but sometimes they ask their
  own questions). If the Master and the Nämdemän finds
  the answers satisfactory, the Magister writes the result into the
  Membership Scroll and proclaims the apprentice for Gesäll.
  He also hands over a silver coin with a cross on one side.
  </p>
  <p>
   To become a Master, a mage of the chantry must have been a
  member for at least ten years, and successfully defend his
  thesis. This thesis, which until recently had to be written
  completely in Latin, is usually the result of much magickal
  research and labour. By tradition, the mage has to demonstrate
  his magick before the Guild Meeting (where the Magister,
  Forcemaster and Alderman presides as judges), defend his thesis
  from attacks from the appointed opponent and answer three
  metaphysical questions from the judges. If they finds the result
  satisfactory, the Gesäll becomes a Master and is given a
  gold coin, with the seal of his Guild.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mages from the outside must be formally accepted before they
  can be admitted into the chantry. To become an associate member
  (either temporary or permanent), the mage must have at least one,
  preferably two, sponsors from the chantry. They discuss the
  matter with the Weaponsmaster, Forcemaster and Alderman, and if
  they agree, the outsider will be admitted after swearing a solemn
  oath never to reveal anything about the chantry, and having his
  name entered into the Scroll of Associates (as in the apprentice
  initiation). Associates have a bit undefined status. Most are
  simply assumed to be outside the system altogether, and are given
  as much respect each mage feels they deserve. However, the
  Magister can award them additional status, as "Associate of
  Apprentice's Grade", "Associate of Gesäll's Grade" or
  "Associate of Master's Grade" (the last type is often called
  "Elevated Associate").
