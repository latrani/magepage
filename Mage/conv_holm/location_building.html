  <h1>
   Location and Building
  </h1>
  The chantry is located in the Old
  City of Stockholm, on the northern end of Prästgatan (Priest
  Street). The narrow and winding street has not changed much since
  the middle ages. Despite its proximity to the bustling
  Västerlångatan and the Royal Palace, it is remarkably
  empty and silent. The surrounding buildings tower over it, making
  steps and voices echo in the silence. Most windows have
  ornamented cast-iron bars or closed shutters. Low, closed doors
  slightly below the street level lead into unseen courtyards. This
  is one of the oldest parts of Stockholm and one of the least
  changed.
  <p>
   The chantry lies at the northern end, where the street
  abruptly becomes an dead end. A small, unassuming green door is
  all that greets the eye from the outside. Inside, a dark and
  claustrophobic passage leads into a cobblestone courtyard. The
  chantry towers above and around it, apparently one or two stories
  higher than on the outside. The building is quite old, but has
  been renovated several times. However, the almost medieval air
  remains. Great official stone stairs leads up to the second
  floor, while various doors and passages lead off from the
  courtyard.
  </p>
  <p>
   Inside, the feeling of age and claustrophobia is even
  stronger. Small barred windows send dust-filled beams of pale
  light into the shadows. The doorways are low and narrow, the
  walls either chalked white or covered with flaking paint hidden
  behind drapes or paintings. No two rooms are the same, corridors
  meet in odd angles, stairs lead up and down and the air is stale
  and smells slightly musty. There is no central heating, just big
  fireplaces in most rooms. Electricity has been drawn into most of
  the building by the School of Swedenborg, meaning great clunky
  switches and snaking wires badly painted over on the walls.
  Paintings, drapes, small sculptures in niches and cabinets with
  curios fill the walls everywhere, often to hide flaking paint and
  holes. On many doors occult symbols are painted in red letters as
  protection.
  </p>
  <p>
   The chantry is divided into several parts. The bottom floor
  houses both a good number of the servants and other staff, and
  the areas belonging to the Guild of Bacchus. Along with the
  passage from the entrance a guard room is places, looking out
  into the street. The second floor is living quarters for the
  Guilds of Mercury and Vulcanus, the banquet hall, labs and
  workshops. The library is located on the third floor. The other
  parts of this and the next floors are unreachable, the doors are
  locked or walled up. The reason is that as the chantry lost much
  of its power, it couldn't afford the quintessence expenditures to
  keep the upper stories in true existence. However, a small tower
  with an observatory remains, looking out towards the Royal Palace
  and the Palace Church.

   Important Places
  </h1>
  <a name="BANQUET_HALL">
   <b>
    The Banquet
  Hall
   </b>
  </a>
  is a large, rustic room on the second floor. Its
  rather dark, lighted by a row of narrow windows and a huge
  fireplace under a big sword. Its dominated by three long tables
  of dark and heavy wood. Each table is reserved for its guild, and
  each mage has his own place. Apprentices sit at the far ends,
  closest to the drafty doors. The Masters sit at the upper ends,
  closer to the windows and the fireplace, and at the ends
  themselves ornate chairs are placed for the Nämdemän.
  Along the walls hangs portraits of the great mages of the
  chantry: the Founders, Urban Hiärne, Swedenborg, Oscar Krook
  and Ernst Prahler, among others. It is used as a meeting place,
  especially in matters pertaining to the chantry as a whole
  without deeper magickal meaning.
  <p>
   <a name="CEREMONY_ROOM">
    <b>
     The Ceremony Room
    </b>
   </a>
   is
  adjacent to the Banquet Hall, and is surrounded by smaller
  laboratories and storerooms kept by the Guild of Mercury. The
  walls and windows are all covered with heavy black drapes,
  damping sounds into soft murmurs and absorbing all light. The air
  is heavy, smelling of incense and candlewax. In the wooden floor,
  a simple but dominating pentagram has been laid in with great
  skill, although it is rather worn by now. This is the place where
  the Guild of Mercury conducts its ceremonies. Most of the time
  the room is empty, guarded and kept in order by the Laboratory
  Master.
  </p>
  <p>
   <a name="LIBRARY">
    <b>
     The Library
    </b>
   </a>
   is reached through a
  narrow stairway leading up to a small door. Beside the entrance a
  bronze plaque proclaims the Protocols. The Library is crammed
  full of tall, rickety shelves filled with old and new books. The
  shelves are placed so close that its often hard to turn in the
  narrow passageways, and passing people is not possible without
  breaking social decorum. Since all windows are blocked by faded
  drapes or shelves, the only light comes from small lanterns which
  hang in iron hooks from the shelves (no electricity in any form
  is allowed in the Library). To make the place even more crammed,
  in places glass cabinets holding antiques, curios and rare books
  block the passages. The Librarian resides in an adjoining small
  room, crammed full of books and codices in various states of
  repair and cataloguing. He is also the only person who has the
  key to the Master Room, a part of the Library only Masters have
  access to. Rumours tell that there are even a locked chamber only
  mages with permission from both the Alderman, the Magister and
  the Forcemaster may see.
  </p>
  <p>
   <a name="CHAPEL">
    <b>
     The Chapel
    </b>
   </a>
   is the domain of the
  White Brothers. Its fairly austere, with simple white-chalked
  walls, plain wooden benches and a single Celtic cross behind the
  altar. Its not very large, and on closer examination appears to
  be in need of repair. Its also one of the few really peaceful
  places in the chantry, mainly because its not often visited by
  anybody else than the White Brothers. Each Sunday they hold
  masses for the inhabitants of the chantry, but even then the
  Chapel is fairly empty.
  </p>
  <p>
   <a name="COMPUTER_ROOM">
    <b>
     The Computer Room
    </b>
   </a>
   is a room
  under some stairs, just behind the lavatories of the second
  floor. If the Library is crammed, this room is unbelievable.
  Screens, mainframes, peripherals and black boxes cover the walls
  and most of the floor, which is littered with snaking cables.
  This is the realm of
   <a href="Mage/conv_holm/members.html#LEVI">
    Levi Haugen
   </a>
   , who lies in a swivelling sofa connected to it
  all. Its also one of the few places in the chantry where there is
  a phone (another is the workshop of the Guild of Vulcanus, which
  uses a cannibalised phonebooth).
  </p>
  <p>
   <a name="TOWER">
    <b>
     The Tower
    </b>
   </a>
   is reached through a
  narrow, windy and cold stairwell which has not been properly
  renovated for years. At the top is a small room dominated by a
  fine old brass telescope. The windows are unfortunately rather
  dirty, and the roof is no longer possible to open. Strewn around
  the room is surplus furniture and odds and ends which of some
  reason have appeared here.
   <a href="Mage/conv_holm/members.html#RYGER">
    Ryger
   </a>
   sometimes sleeps here, on a dirty mattress in a
  corner.
  </p>
  <p>
   <a name="CELLARS">
    <b>
     The cellars
    </b>
   </a>
   are truly medieval.
  Their ancient masonry is seeping with moisture and slowly
  crumbling. There is practically no light, and the echoes are
  strangely disturbing. Some parts are used to store food or
  equipment, but most is largely unused. Dark archways are filled
  with mouldy rubbish. In one part there are several quite
  serviceable prison-cells. Several secret tunnels lead away from
  the cellars. Once they connected the chantry to the Dominican
  convent in the south, an escape route to the harbour and into the
  cellars of the royal palace, but now most of the tunnels have
  decayed and are too unsafe for any use.
  </p>
  <p>
   <a name="TEMPLE">
    <b>
     The Temple
    </b>
   </a>
   is located below most
  of the cellars. A black oaken door, flanked by two unsettling
  statues is the entrance. Inside, seven steps lead down to another
  door decorated by a religious carving, unfortunately quite hard
  to discern in the darkness. The Temple itself is a octagonal
  chamber with a domed ceiling held up by elaborately carved arches
  of blackened wood. The chamber is lit up by hundreds of votive
  candles placed in chandeliers on low benches along the walls. In
  the middle is a well filled with clear water, the centrum of
  power here. Archways in each wall lead to adjoining chambers.
  Three of these are used as sepulchres for the dead mages of the
  chantry. The others are used as storerooms for candles and the
  tools, books and talismans of the Forcemaster. Only he and his
  helpers are allowed down here.
