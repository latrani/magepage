  <h1>
   Magickal Aspects
  </h1>
  The chantry does not have any horizon
  realm. Instead it relies on Correspondence manipulations. If one
  were to carefully map out each room in the building, it would
  soon be apparent that they won't fit together; many overlap and
  the chantry is around twice as large as the physical building.
  The Paradigm is equally patched. Essentially, most rooms are
  sanctums with different paradigms. The laws of reality can change
  by simply walking through a doorway. This has certain problems,
  since some magick is coincidental in one area of the building but
  produces paradox in other areas.
  <p>
   Roughly speaking, each Guild controls one fourth of the
  building each. The rooms of the Guild of Bacchus on the bottom
  floor are closest to static reality. In fact, they are not very
  good sanctums. On the second floor, magickal reality is much
  stronger. The Guild of Mercury dominates this floor, much to the
  irritation of the Guild of Vulcanus, which is located in the
  eastern wing. Some places, like the
   <a href="Mage/conv_holm/location_building.html#BANQUET_HALL">
    Banquet Hall
   </a>
   are quite flexible for all types of magick,
  while the
   <a href="Mage/conv_holm/location_building.html#CEREMONY_ROOM">

   </a>
   or the
   <a href="Mage/conv_holm/location_building.html#COMPUTER_ROOM">
    Computer Room
   </a>
   have very specialised paradigms.
  </p>
  <p>
   The chantry is protected by many elaborate wards. The main
  ward simply makes sleepers and reality at large to ignore the
  chantry. People walking along Priest Street will not remember the
  building, and will not be interested in it if they notice it.
  Another ward makes it similarly invisible from the Umbra. It is
  the duty of the Forcemaster to keep these wards and the
  correspondence effects in working order.

  <h2>
   Nodes
  </h2>
  The chantry has several nodes. The main node is the
  well in the
  <a href="Mage/conv_holm/location_building.html#TEMPLE">
   Temple
  </a>
  , where the quintessence necessary for the upkeep of
  the wards is stored in the holy water which seeps in from the
  ground. It taps the two ancient ley-lines which first attracted
  people to the city. One is linked to Earth; it originally ran
  along the Stockholm ridge towards Uppsala (today the Technocracy
  has weakened it considerably, but it still remains since its so
  profoundly connected to the city and its geography). The other is
  linked to Water, and connects lake MÃ¤laren with the
  archipelago and the sea.
  <p>
   The other main sources of quintessence are two nodes in the
  south part of the city. One is located on the place where the
  gallows once stood, on top of Erstaberget. Today it is a lawn in
  front of a school. The mages are helped by the ghost of Tomas
  Nielsson who died 1494, a forger who was hanged with his coins
  sewn onto his chest. These coins appear in the lawn and contain
  the quintessence (although the node has dried up considerably
  after the executions ended). The other node is a small chapel
  nearby, where Tass appears in the form of votive candles, which
  are then used in the chantry.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beside the main nodes, the Convivo also taps several transient
  nodes. One node is the trinity spring in Uggleviken. This spring
  has been a centrum for pagan worship since time immemorial. The
  celebrations on the 1st of May around it with singing and dancing
  continued well into the early 20th century, when they died out
  under Technocracy pressure. However, on the ancient Sabbaths the
  place (the spring itself has almost dried out) regains its power.
  This node was originally the domain of the Children of Bacchus,
  but is now handled by the Forcemaster.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another node which is occasionally tapped is located on a
  small island, just a rock, in the archipelago outside Stockholm.
  The glaciers of the Ice age left the surface of the island
  smoothly eroded into almost the shape of a palm. In the middle of
  the palm, a small puddle sometimes appear, filled with
  quintessence. This usually happens just after storms, especially
  in the autumn.
