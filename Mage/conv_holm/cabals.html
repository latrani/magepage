    Cabals of the Convivo Holmiensis

  <h1>
   Cabals
  </h1>
  There are two forms of cabals at the chantry.
  Formal cabals can be created according to the statutes, and have
  some administrative power. However, currently none are truly
  active. The last true formal cabal was the Societas Magiorum
  Ingenuorum Holmiensis (The Society of the Free Mages of
  Stockhom), formed to fight Staaf around 1900 but based on the
  formal cabal behind the assassination of king Gustaf III and the
  reign of Count Karl. It remained in existence as a honorary name
  for its members after the refounding of the chantry. Today only
  <a href="Mage/conv_holm/members.html#TIBERIUS">
   Tiberius de Wrang
  </a>
  remains, and he seldom mentions his
  membership.
  <p>
   Other formal cabals have been the Brothers of Iron, which were
  active among the Guild of Vulcanus to gain influence over the
  mining and refining of iron and lumber, the Societas Ultima
  Thule, which was involved in exploration and Ordo Ascleipos,
  which sought to heal and cure the sleepers. Today none of them
  remains, although they could theoretically be formally reinstated
  if there were any interest.
  </p>
  <p>
   Informal cabals are however very active, and many mages are
  members of several. The main groups are:
  </p>
  <h2>
   <a name="CONSERVATIVES">
    The Conservatives
   </a>
  </h2>
  This group
  is dominated by
  <a href="Mage/conv_holm/members.html#TIBERIUS">
   the Magister
  </a>
  and
  <a href="Mage/conv_holm/members.html#KROOK">
   the Forcemaster
  </a>
  . The members are loyal to the old rules, and
  wants to make the others adhere to them. They generally regard
  the
  <a href="Mage/conv_holm/members.html#ALDERMAN">
   Alderman
  </a>
  and the
  <a href="cabals.html#POLITICIANS">
   Politicians
  </a>
  with distaste, and
  grumble about how the Convivo was better organised in the good
  old days of Prahler. They regard the addition of the Guild of
  Bacchus as a mistake, and are very suspicious of the Virtual
  Adepts.
  <h2>
   <a name="POLITICIANS">
    The Politicians
   </a>
  </h2>
  This group
  consists of the mages involved in political manoeuvrings, both
  inside the chantry and outside. The main members are the
  <a href="Mage/conv_holm/members.html#ALDERMAN">
   Alderman
  </a>
  ,
  <a href="Mage/conv_holm/members.html#SODERBERG">
   SÃ¶derberg
  </a>
  and
  <a href="Mage/conv_holm/members.html#KURT">
   Kurt
  </a>
  (i.e. most of the ruling mages). They run the chantry,
  and make sure it is safe, often using technomantic methods. They
  feel that the chantry has to be protected at any cost, and that
  this protection must be subtle and efficient, not locked in old
  traditions or rules. One way to ensure safety is to minimise
  conflicts with the Technocracy, so the Politicians tend to stop
  too dramatic attacks.
  <h2>
   <a name="ANTI-TECHNOMANCERS">
    The
  Anti-Technomancers
   </a>
  </h2>
  This cabal, led by
  <a href="Mage/conv_holm/members.html#MAUD">
   Maud Juthling
  </a>
  and consisting mainly of members of the Guild
  of Vulcanus, fights the Technocracy in various ways. Its members
  usually work alone, sometimes coordinating their schemes more or
  less. Their methods and goals vary, but they are always
  non-violent and often quite subtle.
  <a href="Mage/conv_holm/members.html#MAUD">
   Juthling
  </a>
  is spreading alternative medicine and mistrust
  against normal medical care.
  <a href="Mage/conv_holm/members.html#NILS">
   Nils
  </a>
  tries to divine the latest evil schemes of the enemy.
  <a href="Mage/conv_holm/members.html#LARS-ERIK">
   Lars-Erik
  </a>
  spreads weird science to the School of Polhem. The
  <a href="cabals.html#POLITICIANS">
   Politicians
  </a>
  usually let
  them do what they want as long as it doesn't threaten the chantry
  or make the Technocracy too upset, while the
  <a href="cabals.html#CONSERVATIVES">
   Conservatives
  </a>
  ignore them.
  <h2>
   <a name="PHILOSOPHERS">
    The Philosophers
   </a>
  </h2>
  This group
  consists almost exclusively of members of the Guild of Mercury,
  and is led by
  <a href="Mage/conv_holm/members.html#TIBERIUS">
   Tiberius
  </a>
  and the
  <a href="Mage/conv_holm/members.html#KROOK">
   Forcemaster
  </a>
  . They gather together over a few bottles of wine
  and discuss matters of metaphysics, philosophy and magick,
  usually at a very high level. Everybody is welcome to join the
  discussions, but the cabal tend to talk over the heads of
  newcomers until the newcomers learn the complex jargon. This
  cabal is completely uninterested in matters of politics, and is
  content as long as there is interesting problems to discuss.
  <h2>
   <a name="INDIVIDUALISTS">
    The Individualists
   </a>
  </h2>
  Many
  mages doesn't care about the other cabals goals. They form an
  ill-defined group of individual mages who work on their own more
  or less odd goals, or just try to avoid trouble. It overlaps
  somewhat with the philosophers. Some, like
  <a href="Mage/conv_holm/members.html#PETER">
   Peter Svec
  </a>
  , try to cause trouble or make the chantry change,
  but the others discreetly avoid them.
