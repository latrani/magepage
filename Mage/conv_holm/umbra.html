    The Umbra of Stockholm

  <h1>
   The Umbra of Stockholm
  </h1>
  The Umbra of Stockholm is a
  sterile place. The city lacks the umbral presence of other cities
  like Paris, New York or Uppsala, which are dreamed about, loved
  and hated. In the High Umbra Stockholm lacks a strong concept,
  and is a grey abstraction. Large parts of the city have no real
  feeling, and exists only as pale shadows except for some
  landmarks or important places.
  <p>
   The most obvious property of the near umbra of Stockholm is
  the dirt. The umbral streets are littered and dirty. In the
  winter piles of ice mixed with salt and gravel slouch around like
  dejected amoebas, aimlessly following travelling mages or the
  shadows of sleepers. The Umbra is usually hazy, filled with a
  grey spiritual mist which seems to drain the colour of
  everything.
  </p>
  <p>
   One of the most enigmatic and unsettling presences in the
  umbra are the alienators, which stalk in the suburbs. They are
  not seen, only felt as an intense feeling of loneliness and
  isolation. They apparently seek out anybody who does not belong
  to a group or walks alone, and envelop him. Their victim
  effectively gains several extra dots in arcane which won't go
  away; nobody will notice him, friends forget about his existence
  and he cannot make contact with people. Slowly everyone will
  forget about the victim, until he just disappears or dies. The
  alienators are more dangerous in the umbra, but they sometimes
  venture out of it searching for prey.
  </p>
  <p>
   Large areas of the city are only present in the umbra as
  abstractions, visualisations of concepts. Östermalm is
  represented by a large area of almost identical buildings,
  imposing, staid and with an air of conservatism and old money.
  Many of the suburbs are just abstractions of concrete and
  asphalt. The two major exceptions are the Old Town and
  Hötorgs City. The Old Town is quite present in the Umbra,
  and looks even more medieval than in the real world. Old
  buildings lean over the narrow streets, and behind closed doors
  and shuttled windows secrets can be imagined. In dark alleys and
  hidden courtyards German voices can be heard, and the royal
  palace is still crowned with the high tower with the three crowns
  which burned in the seventeenth century.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hötorgs City on the other hand is the essence of the
  Technocracy. Sergel's Plaza looks exactly as in the real world,
  but is much bigger and more desolate. A cold wind blows across
  the black and white surface. The glass monolith shines with a
  cold green light which reflects in the black glass facades of the
  surrounding buildings. Nothing moves, nothing can be heard except
  a low electrical humming.
  </p>
  <p>
   There are some landmarks in the Umbra. The waters of Stockholm
  are still there in the umbra, dark and turbulent but at the same
  time cold and fresh. Several high buildings can always be seen,
  like Wenner-Gren centre, the tax skyscraper, the tower of the
  city hall, several churches, the Globe arena and the buildings at
  Sergel's plaza.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Gauntlet is very strong in Stockholm. There is no place
  for wonders between concrete and reasonable minds. A garou would
  probably remark that there is remarkably little life within the
  Umbra. However, there is a strong seasonal variation. In the
  winter, Stockholm is ruled totally by the Technocracy. There is
  no life, everything is cold and prosaic and the Umbra is cloaked
  in grey, featureless clouds. The sleepers hurry along without
  acknowledging each others existence, wrapped in their own worries
  and winter clothing. But during late spring and in the summer,
  life manages to break through, people discover each other and the
  Umbra begins to bloom. Some mages have proposed that the
  Technocracy is on holiday like everyone else. During the summer
  months sunlight even lights up the Umbra.
  </p>
  <p>
   There are several ways of moving towards the deep umbra from
  the near umbra, and not all are equal. By walking down into the
  subways or tunnels in downtown, a mage can enter the subterranean
  world beneath the city. Concrete tunnels and passageways stretch
  on forever, linked by metal doors covered in flaking paint.
  Graffiti and dirt cover everything, and the fluorescent lights
  doesn't work properly. Down here lives the rejects, the
  borderline cases which do not fit in the reality above. The
  underground seems to stretch on forever, ever deeper and further
  away from the surface.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another road is towards abstraction. As one walks further out
  towards the higher umbra, things change. The city gets more and
  more empty and abstract, almost like it was just an picture with
  nothing under. The different parts of the city become simple
  concepts, which gradually become pointless. Finally there are
  nothing less but an empty void and the concept "Stockholm".
