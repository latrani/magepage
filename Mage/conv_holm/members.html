   <h2>
    <a id="GUILD_OF_MERCURY" name="GUILD_OF_MERCURY">
     Guild of
  Mercury
    </a>
   </h2>
   The Guild is the most traditional, and most
  members support the old customs. Through the years the
  differences between the White Brothers and hermetic mages have
  vanished, and they work fine together. The main problem with the
  guild is that it has become quite lethargic, and leave most
  problem for the political fraction. After the coup against Staaf
  the guild flowered under the Aldermen Krook and Prahler. But
  after Prahlers death 1975 the Alderman and his Nämdemän
  have become more politicians and bureaucrats than mages. The
  Alderman is slowly dying, his successor is almost a technocrat,
  the two most powerful mages are old and unwilling to deal with
  politics and there are no reasonable successors.
   <h3>
    <a id="ALDERMAN" name="ALDERMAN">
     Alderman Björn
  Adelswärd
    </a>
   </h3>
   Master Adelswärd is an old alchemist,
  a fellow student with Ernst Prahler under their master Lars
  Ståhlbrand (who was the leader of the
   <a href="Mage/conv_holm/others.html#CONSOCIATO">
    Consociato Upsaliensis
   </a>
   in Uppsala 1850-1890). He spent a long
  time down on the continent, but returned just before the death of
  Prahler. He became Nämdeman and suddenly Alderman without
  really wanting it, forced by circumstances. He has however
  carried his burden well, despite his own weariness.
   <p>
    The Alderman is frail, sickly man with a body of sharp angles
  and pale skin stretched over his bones. His hair is thin and
  black, his sunken eyes are always in shadow and he dresses in
  grey clothes which seem just to hang on him. His age is
  indeterminate. Actually he looks like a living skeleton, which is
  not far from the truth. He seldom speaks, preferring to cast his
  unsettling gaze at people who ask him things. When he speaks, it
  is in a low and rasping voice and he prefers not to say too much.
  Most of the time he prefers the isolation of his rooms, and only
  emerges for official functions.
   </p>
   <p>
    All his life he has sought ways to understand the Technocracy
  and to find ways to avoid confrontations with it. He is no longer
  interested in magick per se, but in how the Technocracy could be
  balanced. At the same time he is secretly burdened by feelings of
  guilt, both because of his actions (he always remembers his
  mistakes, regardless how small), because of his failure as mage
  and Alderman, because of the suspicion that he has benefited from
  the death of Prahler and because of his inability to prevent his
  own death. He can sit for days in his chamber just staring
  emptily into the air.
   </p>
   <p>
    His familiar,
    <a id="NERO" name="NERO">
     Nero
    </a>
    is a huge
  black dog. He is highly intelligent, loyal to his master and
  hateful to anybody who dislikes him. Most mages try to avoid him,
  except the Magister who Nero actually fears instead. Most of the
  time he lies at the feet of his master anyway.

    Master of Matter and Forces. He has numerous magickal
  substances in small vials in his office, some with quite dramatic

   </p>
   <h3>
    <a id="TIBERIUS" name="TIBERIUS">
     Magister Tiberius de
  Wrang
    </a>
   </h3>
   Tiberius is a handsome man, apparently in his late
  forties. He is very long, with sharp eyes and slightly greying
  hair at his temples. He usually dresses in conservative strict,
  dark clothes outside the chantry. He always carries a black
  stick, giving him an air of a gentleman from old times. Inside
  the chantry or in ceremonial circumstances he wears a silk robe
  the colour of blood. He gives a strict impression, sometimes
  autocratic and arrogant, but usually more like an old teacher. He
  never humbly asks for anything, he order people around or explain
  in no uncertain terms what he wants. In fact, he often talks to
  people as if they where spirits imprisoned in his triangle.
   <p>
    Tiberius is older than he looks. In reality he is over 150
  years old. He was born into a noble family, and spent his youth
  studying at first the military arts, then turned to the liberal
  arts to the irritation of his family who expected him to become
  an officer. Instead he spent his time in intellectual or occult
  circles, devouring philosophy, esoterica and art with an
  impressive zeal. He was approached by a Goetic master, a fairly
  weak and slightly mad figure, who he soon became apprentice to.
  Soon the brash young mage surpassed his master in skill and
  power, something the old man never forgave him.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tiberius was one of the most active mages in the coup against
  Staaf, although he preferred to avoid attention. He let Mr. and
  Mrs Krook get most of it, and their secret triumvirate was the
  real power behind the newfounded chantry (It was in fact Tiberius
  who manipulated things to that the chantry would use the old
  statutes and not write new ones). He has retained the good
  relationship with their son, who he often behaves a bit fatherly
  towards (
    <a href="members.html#KROOK">
     Richard
    </a>
    usually
  vehemently protests such behaviour). They spend much time in
  friendly arguments about ethics and philosophy.
   </p>
   <p>
    It may appear a bit strange that Tiberius is not Alderman
  despite his power and experience. This is mainly the fault of
  Prahler. Under the leadership of Prahler, Tiberius found himself
  confronted with an equally powerful and devious mage, who made it
  clear who was Alderman and who was not. However, they had an
  unspoken agreement to let Tiberius succeed him as Alderman when
  his time had come. However, when the old Magister died Tiberius
  was asked to temporarily replace him until a permanent Magister
  could be found. At the same time
    <a href="members.html#ALDERMAN">
     Adelswärd
    </a>
    became Nämdeman
  of the Guild of Mercury. Then the Alderman died unexpectedly,
    <a href="members.html#ALDERMAN">
     Adelswärd
    </a>
    found himself
  new Alderman and Tiberius was suddenly trapped as Magister since
  the new Alderman didn't appoint a new one. Quite naturally he
  dislikes the current Alderman, but hides it well. He has also
  resigned himself to his political fate, having realised that he
  is searching for real power, not petty politics. One of his
  current goals is to gain peerage in the Umbral Court.
   </p>
   <p>
    Throughout the years Tiberius has done much and learned even
  more. Through his deals with different beings he have gained both
  power and wealth, but it doesn't interest him very much. Instead
  he wants to learn the innermost secrets of the spirit-world and
  its denizens. However, his age is slowly gaining on him despite
  the strategic pacts he has made which has retained his youth. But
  now he feels that age, hubris and his old mistakes are slowly
  gaining on him, and to escape them he might need to make much
  darker deals than he is used to. Some powerful beings have
  already made him offers, and he is secretly afraid he will not be
  able to resist them. If he would become corrupt, he could easily
  drag the entire chantry with him.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tiberius has an false official identity as an artist. He lives
  in a grand apartment with a studio where he indulges in his
  hobby, sculpture. He is in fact a quite good artist, and his
  statues are remarkable pieces of art. Several decorate the
  chantry, ranging from the disturbing guardian demons flanking the
  entrance to the Ceremony Room to the beautiful angels he has made
  for the Chapel. Although he regards use of Matter magick as
  cheating, he sometimes takes a few shortcuts. He had an assistant
  for quite some time in his studio, until the young man was killed
  by a demonic force. Tiberius has done his best to hide and forget
  the sordid affair, but
    <a href="members.html#KROOK">
     Master
  Krook
    </a>
    still remembers and is secretly worried.

    Master of Forces, Spirit and Correspondence, Adept of several
  spheres. His personal library is huge, and contains many very
  rare tomes about the spirit world. His staff is a Mind-talisman
  giving him the ability to bend others to his will, dominate
  people or resist mental attacks. He has also several other
  talismans, not to mention many spirits imprisoned in jars or
  crystals. His main spiritual contact is the demon Vassago, who
  shares his thirst for ultimate knowledge.

   <h3>
    <a id="KROOK" name="KROOK">
     Forcemaster Richard
  Krook
    </a>
   </h3>
   Richard is an old man with white hair, a deeply
  furrowed brow and a gentle personality. He is usually informally
  dressed and dislike formalia, but when he has to he wears his
  ceremonial robes with great charisma. When he appears as
  Forcemaster in formal matters, clad in pure white and surrounded
  by the nimbus of his office, he is an impressive man and behaves
  much more forcefully. He is a friendly and warm person, who would
  rather be a normal priest than a master magician. He likes to sit
  in parks and just watch or talk to people.
   <p>
    He is the son of Oscar and Signe Krook, and has grown up in
  the chantry. After being initiated into the White Brotherhood he
  left the chantry to act as a priest like his father. He soon
  realised that being a priest put a barrier between himself and
  the people he loved, so he started to work directly among the
  sleepers instead. During this time he was more a member of the
  Consociatio Upsaliensis than his old chantry. When the previous
  Forcemaster died, he was called back to the chantry and unhappily
  became Forcemaster. He is however an excellent Prime mage, and
  would be a perfect Forcemaster if he only could learn enough
  Correspondence. Currently he has to discreetly ask the Virtual
  Adepts for help in certain matters.
   </p>
   <p>
    Richard has a peculiar relationship with
    <a href="members.html#TIBERIUS">
     Tiberius
    </a>
    , who he sees a bit like a
  father-figure. Tiberius has been there all his life, both
  threatening and fascinating. They spend much time together, being
  the oldest mages at the chantry and have very different
  philosophies. Richard feels that Tiberius is risking his soul
  with his magick and cynical attitudes, and constantly keeps an
  watchful eye on him.
   </p>
   <p>
    Richard is very observant, and generally knows what is going
  on. He has a tendency to see everything from a mystical
  standpoint, which makes it a bit hard to understand what he has
  realised. His mystical attitude also makes him appear oddly
  unmoved by pain and evil, he seems to regard it as natural as
  everything else. He just realises that it is a necessary part of
  creation, which should be fought but is not wrong in itself. He
  has come to the conclusion that Satan just does his work since he
  was created by God just in order to provide an opposite of
  good.
   </p>
   <p>
    In fact, Richard is close to an epiphany which would once and
  for all move him above the paradigm of his tradition. He
  understands this on a deep level, but his love for the chantry,
  his tradition and the sleepers around him holds him back from
  taking the next step. He realises that if he advances further, he
  will no longer be able to hold office as Forcemaster, and since
  he lacks any worthy apprentice, the chantry would suffer. So his
  kindness and love holds him back from the path to Ascension.

   </h3>
   Söderberg is a
   <a href="Mage/roci2.html">
    Rosicrucian
   </a>
   , and responsible for the links of the chantry to
  various Masonic lodges and the local politics. He is an
  anonymous, efficient person who discreetly makes sure everything
  works. He is seldom seen, since he prefers to work from the
  shadows and outside the chantry. He has several acolytes and many
  contacts, but few friends in the chantry. When he is seen, he
  appears like a well dressed middle-aged gentleman with steel-
  rimmed glasses and conservative tie, often carrying a newspaper.
  He speaks formally, articulately and with absolutely no regional
  accent. Like the
   <a href="members.html#ALDERMAN">
    Alderman
   </a>
   he
  is more of a politician than a mage. He practically never use any
  obvious magick except subtle Mind effects. In fact, quite a few
  mages regard him as little better than a technomancer.
   <p>
    Söderberg is both ambitious and careful. He knows that he
  will most probably become the next Alderman, and desires the
  office. At the same time he is very careful to give a good
  impression and protect the chantry. He is discreetly helping just
  about every fraction, making them dependent on him. Since the
    <a href="members.html#ALDERMAN">
     Alderman
    </a>
    is often too weak to
  act, Söderberg has taken upon himself to act in his place.
  Few mages have realised how much power he has and how important
  he is for the safety of the chantry. He is however vary of

    and the
    <a href="members.html#KROOK">

  rivals. He regards the rest of the mages as fairly uninteresting

   Simon
  is a placid, thoughtful cabalist who prefers to sit and sleep in
  the library more than get involved with things. He is a smallish,
  slightly plump man with glasses who generally gives the
  impression of a sleepy squirrel. He is practically always found
  with a book or two, usually asleep in a comfortable chair. In
  fact, he has begun to develop his skills at using his magick in
  dreams, and he often get fascinating visions during his sleep.
  Why stay awake?
   <p>
    Although he is lethargic when it comes to chantry politics, he
  is very involved in environmental questions which seems to be the
  only thing that can make him agitated. He has many friends in
  environmental organisations outside the chantry. The reason for
  this is a series of possibly prophetic nightmares he have had
  about a future environmental catastrophe, where some kind of huge
  fireball burns through reality and scatters it like dust.

   <h3>
    <a id="HENRIKSSON" name="HENRIKSSON">
     The Gesälls Simon
  and Adolf Henriksson
    </a>
   </h3>
   The alchemist Henriksson brothers
  are pupils of the late Master Prahler. He begun training the
  brothers, but died before finishing their education. After his
  death the brothers inherited his books, talismans and materials,
  something which has led to eternal quarrels between them. Both
  are in their fifties, and still fight just like small children
  over petty disputes.
   <p>
    They are quite different. Simon, the elder brother, is a
  blond, jovial man with heavy glasses and an insatiable curiosity.
  Adolf is dark haired, narrow, nervous and extremely stubborn.
  While Simon calmly experiments with just about everything until
  he grows bored, Adolf can spend months solving a problem.
   </p>
   <p>
    Simon's speciality is chemistry in all its forms, and he is
  the chantry expert in technomantic chemistry. He happily
  experiment with both ancient and modern concepts, often combining
  them in odd ways. His current project is to try to create
  alchemically pure forms of Air, which he plans to use as a thesis
  to become a Master (he has piles of half finished thesises in his
  drawers). His laboratory is filled with pipes and vessels filled
  with various gasses.
   </p>
   <p>
    Adolf is obsessed with finding a method to preserve life in
  the form of dry powder. He has successfully reanimated simpler
  animals and plants from ash, and now plans to attempt to
  reanimate higher forms of life as his thesis. He is very
  traditional, and his laboratory really looks like a classic
  alchemical laboratory (complete with stuffed crocodile). Beside
  reanimation, he is interested in the secret powers of the blood
  and the secrets of the Gayomart-figure ("Mortal Life") in classic
  Zoroastrism, who was split into the seven metals and created life
  with its golden seed.
   </p>
   <p>
    Both brothers share a secret. As apprentices of Prahler they
  learned quite a bit about his real nature, and know that he was
  hardly the saint he has made out to be. In fact, he had several
  private projects which would have had him expelled from the
  chantry if they had become known to the others. After his death
  they destroyed the most incriminating evidence and hid much of it
  in the library, where the Librarian acts as a confederate in
  keeping the documents forgotten. In fact, the only thing which
  can make the brothers cooperate is the fear that somebody would
  find out the truth about Prahler and taint his memory.

   </h2>
   The Guild has close ties to the
   <a href="members.html#ULV">
    Ulv family
   </a>
   , and several members of the
  family have been mages and many exhibit at least some signs of
  the Gift. Unlike the

    Guild of Mercury
   </a>
   the Guild of
  Vulcanus function quite well, the members support each other and
  their Mastermechanicus, they protect the chantry and fight the
  Technocracy. Their main weakness is that the members are more
  practical than magickal, and that much of their work is closer to
  engineering and manipulating public opinion than magick.
   <h3>
    <a id="MAUD" name="MAUD">
     Mästermechanicus Maud
  Juthling
    </a>
   </h3>
   Maud is an impressive woman apparently in her
  forties, with a freckled face, black hair and built like a bear.
  Her demeanour is forceful, brusque and she always speaks her
  mind, often to the despair of more political mages. To make
  things worse, her views are radical and politically incorrect.
   <p>
    She is the chantry expert on Life, and has devoted her
  considerable energy to find ways to subvert Technocracy medicine
  and replace it with traditional methods. Her own theories of
  medicine are based upon the ideas of the 30's, which stressed
  cold baths, exercise, sunlight and gymnastics. She is also
  interested in racial medicine, and have some definite views about
  what characteristics are inherited. The apprentices call her
  "Mama Hitler" behind her back.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her laboratory looks like a cross between gym and a doctors
  office, with exercise equipment, cabinets filled with surgical
  implement and bookshelves with very radical medical theories. A
  big aquarium stands in a niche in the wall, with her two
  goldfishes Alpha and Beta, who are a demonstration of her thesis
  that intense sunlight (projected from a machine above the tank)
  can halt ageing. Both are over 40 years old and quite
  healthy.
   </p>
   <p>
    Maud is often absent from the chantry, supporting alternative
  health groups across the nation, spreading propaganda against
  accepted medicine and generally doing her best to sabotage
  technocracy medicine. She has two acolytes, one homeopathic
  doctor and a trainer which help her in her work. At the chantry
  she usually tests some of her new theories and leads the exercise
  group (all mages are welcome to join, although most have
  declined. The
    <a href="members.html#MATS">

  his guildhosts participate).

     Weaponsmaster Mats Ulv
    </a>
   </h3>
   Mats
  was about to start a promising military career when he felt his
  family and the chantry calling to him. He returned, and
   <a href="members.html#MAUD">
    Maud
   </a>
   decided he had the potential to
  become an excellent Weaponsmaster. Unfortunately, Mats turned out
  to be less than a good mage, and never managed to advance very
  far. However, he was awarded the office, and has turned out to be
  a good Weaponsmaster despite his weak magick.
   <p>
    Mats is long and powerfully built. He has blond, crew-cut hair
  and blue eyes unlike the rest of his family (he has used some
  minor Life magick to change them). His behaviour is very
  military, and he mercilessly drills the guild hosts to make them
  prepared for any eventuality. He is quite fanatic about
  protecting the chantry, and several of the mages regards him as
  quite nutty. On the other hand, everyone agrees he is simply the
  best weaponsmaster they have ever had (except maybe Göran
  Fäktare, who was Weaponsmaster of the chantry around 1600
  and died valiantly defending it from the Technocracy).
   </p>
   <p>
    Mats have definite views on about everything, but usually
  keeps quiet unlike his mentor. He is convinced that the
    <a href="members.html#GUILD_OF_BACCHUS">
     Guild of Bacchus
    </a>
    is a bad
  influence, and generally suspects the Virtual Adepts of being up
  to something. Most of the mages of the chantry are too civilian,
  and they don't seem to realise that discipline and efficiency is
  the only way to keep the chantry strong. He supports
    <a href="members.html#MAUD">
     Maud
    </a>
    in every matter, and its hardly a
  secret that he would like to have her as Alderman.

   Nils is a
  middle-aged man with glasses hanging precariously on his nose,
  grey hair and his pockets full of tools, instruments or
  documents. He is constantly on the watch for the Technocracy and
  its nefarious schemes, wherever or whatever they may be. He has
  discovered how the Technocracy plan to drain the Old City of
  Quintessence through a new system of railway tracks, the real
  reason they are fluoridating the water, the dangers of radiation
  from power lines, what chemicals are put in the junk food and how
  they use television to brainwash people. In fact, he is
  completely, clinically insane. However, while most other mages
  think he is a trifle too paranoid, they haven't realised this.
  His predictions and theories are far too often right.
   <p>
    Nils lab is filled with maps, instruments and documents where
  he plots all sorts of data, ranging from background radiation and
  Quintessence levels to the amount of rainfall per capita. He is
  constantly reading the papers and watching the news (through his
  shielded television set, which detects attempts of mind control),
  hunting to the latest attacks from the Technocracy. He is fairly
  convinced that they are planning to strangle the Quintessence
  inside the city by their latest highway projects, and that they
  somehow are using noise in phone lines to subtly reprogram the
  brains of people.

   Lars-Erik looks like the archetypal senior engineer,
  and usually dresses in lab coat or a grey suit. He is
  hyperactive, always planning his latest project and telling
  anybody willing to listen about his theories, wildly
  gesticulating with his unlit pipe (he only smokes when in deep
  thinking). He is also the representative from the Convivo
  Holmiensis when dealing with the School of Polhem, which he
  occasionally secretly meet at the
   <a href="Mage/conv_holm/others.html#ROYAL">
    Royal Institute of Technology
   </a>
   . Both sides find these meetings
  quite enjoyable, since they have the chance of demonstrate their

  to the party line.
   <p>
    He grew up in the chantry, and always marvelled at the power
  of magick and technology displayed by the Guilds. He decided to
  become a mage, made a record-breaking career and became one of
  the youngest Masters ever. However, he soon turned to more
  important pursuits, like machines.
   </p>
   <p>
    Lars-Erik is fascinated with building machines out of unusual
  materials or using alternative effects. After designing workable
  computers based on light or ropes and pulleys instead of
  electricity, he went on building them out of fluidistors and
  later turbulent flows in water. His latest model is a quite
  powerful computer which consists of butane gas flowing inside
  Plexiglas pipes. Beside this, he has also built a prism
  separating different resonances of quintessence and a lightbulb
  which runs on ether.

   <h3>
    <a id="LEVI" name="LEVI">
     Gesäll Levi Haugen
  (Pyramid)
    </a>
   </h3>
   Levi is a young man around 30, with long dark
  hair and deep, brown eyes which are always in shadow. He usually
  dresses quite informally in dirty jeans and t-shirts. His right
  lower arm is an advanced prosthesis, and he often disconnects his
  hand and links it directly into his computers instead. Levi was
  on his way to become an engineer when an accident cut off his
  arm. He became involved in some early experiments with
  myoelectrical prothesises and biofeedback. During these
  experiments he learned not only how to control his arm but also
  how to control other machines in his vicinity. The Virtual Adepts
  noticed him, and snatched him away from Iteration X. He has since
  then been involved in research on better prothesises and
  development of simple cybernetics.
   <p>
    His is the first Virtual Adept to be admitted by the Convivo
  Holmiensis, and it required quite a bit of political manoeuvring
  from the Guild of Vulcanus to convince the Guild of Bacchus to
  support them against the Guild of Mercury who was against the
  admission. Although Haugen is trusted by the Guild of Vulcanus
  and accepted by the Guild of Bacchus, several members of the
  Guild of Mercury (mainly the
    <a href="Mage/conv_holm/cabals.html#CONSERVATIVES">
     Conservatives
    </a>
    ) distrust him as a potential Technocracy spy
  and do their best to avoid him. Levi doesn't care, and does his
  best as a link between his tradition and the chantry. He has
  decided not to attempt to become a Master of the chantry, instead
  concentrating on more important plans, together with
    <a href="Mage/conv_holm/others.html#NULL">
     Null Pointer
    </a>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    Levi is responsible for the computers of the chantry. Although
  there are one or two personal computers at the Guild of Vulcanus,
  he runs the mainframes from his room where he lives among (and
  in) them. Normally he is apparently half asleep in a swivelling
  sofa, with his right arm linked into a tangle of cables and
  connectors, his left hand in a VR-glove and his head covered with
  a VR-helmet. Inside the Web he appears as Pyramid, a huge
  agglomeration of technology forming a pyramid with a glowing eye
  of chrome.
   </p>
   <p>
    Levi has a small kitten, Quantum, who usually sleeps in his
  lap. She is apparently the only living being which he shows any
  affectation for, and they are inseparable. The weird kitten often
  behaves as if she was linked to the Web, and she has an uncanny
  tendency to do what Levi wants before even he knows it. Often she
  just sits and looks at invisible objects, occasionally touching
  them with her paw. She also have the odd tendency to appear in
  the most inaccessible places, with no indication of how she got
  there.

   </h3>
   Ryger is a (former) apprentice of
   <a href="members.html#NILS">
    Master Nils
   </a>
   . He is a silent young man
  with an unkempt appearance and a furtive, scared demeanour. He is
  seldom seen except at nights, when he might be surprised prowling
  the corridors of the chantry with a pile of papers. Usually he
  quickly darts to his room and locks the door if seen.
   <p>
    Most of the inhabitants of the chantry have rarely seen him,
  and most regard him as completely insane. The only one he has any
  real contact with is
    <a href="members.html#NILS">
     Master Nils
    </a>
    ,
  who he sometimes silently helps. He absolutely refuses to engage
  in conversation, and usually just talks in single words. Even
  that is enough to drive him back to his room, a small chamber on
  the second floor whose door he always keeps locked and hidden
  behind a frayed drapery.
   </p>
   <p>
    Christoffer is quite busy reading every paper and magazine he
  can get his hands upon, scanning for strange events, misspellings
  or just patterns in the layout. He has collected a huge amount of
  clippings about weird events, which he keeps in jars and piles.
  He is in fact studying how reality may malfunction or distort,
  and what causes it. He is desperately afraid of saying too much
  about anything, since it might cause reality to change. He is
  hunted by his powerful Avatar, which manifests as synchronicities
  and weirdness. He is uncertain if he is going insane, are about
  to discover something big or just used as a plaything for the
  Powers That Be.

    <a id="GUILD_OF_BACCHUS" name="GUILD_OF_BACCHUS">
     Guild of
  Bacchus
    </a>
   </h2>
   The Guild of Bacchus is the newest guild, and has
  so far not been able to fit in very well. Originally the Children
  of Bacchus (Cult of Ecstasy) had their own chantry, located in
  the bohemian quarters of the city. But during the 60's the
  Technocracy drove them away, demolished the area and built their
  own city-core. The homeless mages were invited by Prahler to the
  Convivo Holmiensis, and joined the chantry as the Guild of
  Bacchus in 1970. After the death of Prahler the Guild have
  struggled to retain its status and acceptance against the
  conservative forces of the chantry.
   <p>
    The older mages from the previous chantry has mainly left or
  died off (their previous Nämdeman, Chris
  Fjällström, died of an overdose heroin a few years
  back). The main goal of the current mages are to become fully
  accepted by the chantry, but are forced to compromise their
  philosophy and lifestyle. Unfortunately most members are
  individualists, and the personal conflicts are slowly
  escalating.
   </p>
   <h3>
    <a id="KURT" name="KURT">
     Nämdeman Kurt
  Fjällström
    </a>
   </h3>
   Kurt is a middle aged man with a
  tired appearance. Using simple Life magick he keeps himself
  somewhat in shape, but he is feeling rather worn out. He has long
  brown hair in a horse-tail, a very high and pale brow and he
  usually dresses in black, all which combine to give him an
  impressive, moody appearance.
   <p>
    Kurt grew up in the Klara chantry, and was the son and student
  of Chris. When they moved to Convivo Holmiensis he followed and
  became apprentice. He was the first of the Children of Bacchus
  who managed to become Gesäll and Master, and he had to fight
  all the way against traditions and prejudices. This have made him
  quite critical against the old rules, and he has several times
  been cited for his comments about them. He is not on friendly
  terms with the conservative groups in the Guild of Mercury, while
  the more radical mages (especially the Virtual Adepts) like him.
  When his father died, he was the only Master of the Guild, and
  automatically became Nämdeman despite his views of the
  organisation. He also became Treasurer due to an accident. The
  previous Treasurer (
    <a href="members.html#SIMON">
     Master Simon
  Keijser
    </a>
    ) relinquished his office since he felt that he was
  not capable enough, and proposed that somebody with stronger ties
  to sleeper society should become taxmaster. Right then Kurt
  arrived at the meeting, half an hour late and carrying a pile of
  money he had won on Poker. Now he does his best as Treasurer, but
  he has realised that the finances of the chantry are almost a
  joke. He will need a financial miracle to pay all the bills.
   </p>
   <p>
    Kurt likes to use magick and to influence society (and the
  chantry) on a large scale, but he has noticed that he more and
  more have become a politician. To get anything done he always has
  to argue, convince and manipulate the other mages, which he
  really detests. He has realised that he has become a part of the
  system he hates, and he can't break free.
   </p>
   <p>
    As a mage, he is very skilled at Time and Entropy, and since
  these spheres are quite underrepresented at the chantry he has
  gained quite a reputation for them. He gladly teaches these
  spheres, but he is not a very good pedagogue. Another problem is
  that time around him seems to behave irregularly. He can never
  keep time, he always arrives too early or too late. No exact
  measurements of time around him are possible (which has made him
  somewhat unwelcome at the laboratories of the Guild of Vulcanus).
  The truth is that he is creating the effects himself, to hide his
  past. Nobody suspects anything, but he secretly fears that
  somebody will discover some dark secret of his. This secret is
  apparently so dark, that he is prepared to do
    <i>
     anything
    </i>
    to
  hide it.

     Master Carina
  Edgarth

   </h3>
   Carina is a striking woman; she has long blond
  hair, a laughing face and is almost a head taller than most
  people around her. She usually wears colourful clothes, their
  colours changing depending on her mood. Her familiar, a parrot
  named Alkibaldes, usually perches shoulder.
   <p>
    Carina became master just recently, after much trouble. She
  was handicapped both by her sex, her Guild and her youth, and had
  great trouble with the rigid bureaucracy of the chantry. Her
  early studies was done at
    <a href="Mage/conv_holm/others.html#CONSOCIATO">
     Uppsala
    </a>
    , but to become a Master she had to work at the
  chantry. Her thesis (a subtle effect involving Time and patterns)
  didn't pass the first time, since she didn't follow the arcane
  rules about the exact formalism of a Masters thesis. She
  eventually managed (supported by much lobbying from
    <a href="members.html#KURT">
     Kurt
    </a>
    ) to convince the other Masters, and
  she became the currently youngest master of the chantry.
   </p>
   <p>
    Carina is a very determined woman with unconventional methods.
  She completely refuses to follow conventions, which usually leads
  to trouble. Her main ambition is to become recognised, but she
  also tries to convey her vision of the beauty of life, which she
  constantly seeks to express through her magick and music. She
  sees infinite beauty and elegance in every breath, and regards
  living as an exquisite pleasure and art. Unfortunately she cannot
  explain it very well outside music, and few of the mages at the
  chantry understands her. Her main practical goal is to give
  Stockholm back some of the vitality stolen by the Technocracy,
  but she has gradually begun to realise the magnitude of the
  task.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her views on the other mages are mixed. She really likes
    <a href="members.html#KURT">
     Kurt
    </a>
    , but dislikes him for his
  involvement in politics and intrigue. She regards
    <a href="members.html#PETER">
     Peter
    </a>
    as a whining brat without
  knowledge and control. She also has a long standing grudge
  against the Guild of Mercury, especially the
    <a href="members.html#TIBERIUS">
     Magister
    </a>
    , since her fight for her
  thesis.
   </p>
   <p>
    She is also in contact with a group of mages known as the
  Children of Odin (Odins Barn), a group of
    <a href="Mage/asatru.html">
     asatru-mages
    </a>
    near Uppsala. She is in fact a partial member of
  their circle, something she carefully hides from the rest of
  Convivo Holmiensis. The Children are one of the few groups of
  mages she feels truly understands the beauty of life, and there
  she can show her true self without having to follow the unspoken
  conventions of her chantry. She has also learned some blood based
  Life magick from them. Its certainly not like the Swedenborgian
  theories taught at the chantry.

   <h3>
    <a id="PETER" name="PETER">
     Apprentice Peter
  Svec
    </a>
   </h3>
   Peter is one of the least liked mages of the
  chantry. The only reason for his membership was that the mages
  wanted to keep a close eye on him.
   <p>
    Peter is an Orphan mage. He grew up in a completely normal and
  boring middle class family in the suburbs, and revolted violently
  as a teenager. He did just everything he could to rebel against
  society, and became juvenile delinquent just to show how little
  he cared. Apparently he awoke when a few of his "friends" forced
  him into a bad LSD trip. Suddenly he saw through all the
  illusions around him, and realised that behind the comfortable
  confines of normal reality existed only eternal darkness and
  chaos. The revelation almost drove him insane for several days,
  until he managed to pull himself together and ask the big
  question: "So what?".
   </p>
   <p>
    Soon afterwards he became involved with some occult and
  Satanist groups. He slowly came to the conclusion that reality is
  just a comfortable illusion erected by people afraid of accepting
  the truth. There is no God, no real light and nihilism is the
  only ethic which works. He broke out from his old friends and
  founded his own sect, Draco Nigris. This sect is more an urban
  gang than an occult group, and Peter manipulates its members
  ruthlessly while trying to make them understand his vision. The
  members regard him as more than a little crazy, but they like his
  ideas about "Do what thou wilt" and total freedom.
   </p>
   <p>
    <a href="members.html#KURT">
     Kurt
    </a>
    discovered the sect on a
  rave in the southern suburbs, and alerted the chantry. After much
  discussion, the leading mages decided that although Peter was an
  unsympathetic person, it would be better to try to make him join
  the chantry to provide a modicum of control and maybe even calm
  him a bit, than leave him and his friends for the Technocracy to
  find. Surprisingly Peter accepted the proposal that he join the
  chantry, and became formally an apprentice of
    <a href="members.html#KURT">
     Master Kurt
    </a>
    . Unfortunately, he didn't
  become calmer, he didn't accept the old rules and he certainly
  wouldn't be controlled. He is a constant headache and
  embarrassment of
    <a href="members.html#KURT">
     Kurt
    </a>
    , and the
    <a href="Mage/conv_holm/cabals.html#CONSERVATIVES">
     Conservatives
    </a>
    are openly against his continued membership. He
  is the archetypal
    <a href="Mage/conv_holm/rules.html#RED_PAINTED">
     "Red Painted Apprentice"
    </a>
    . At the same time many mages
  reluctantly admit that Peter has a certain talent, and that he
  and his sect is a very good source of information about
  underground events in the southern suburbs.
   </p>
   <p>
    Peter's philosophy haven't become brighter, but he has found a
  certain peace in knowing that everything will sooner or later be
  destroyed and return to the darkness beyond. Most of people's
  fears of the darkness come from the fact that it reveals the
  truth, nor that there are many horrors in it. He has tried to
  explain this to the
    <a href="Mage/conv_holm/cabals.html#PHILOSOPHERS">
     Philosophers
    </a>
    , but after realising they just talk over his
  head he has ceased to try.
    <a href="members.html#KROOK">
     Richard
    </a>
    has amusedly remarked that the
  vision of Peter is exactly the same as the White Brothers: his
  darkness which flows through everything is just the same as the
  divine light of the One, just seen from a different and tragic
  perspective. Peter refuses to comment.
   </p>
   <p>
    He is an young man around twenty, wearing black clothes and
  leather with a silver necklace with a swastika inside a
  pentagram. He has long, brown and stringy hair and a short dirty
  beard. However, sometimes he appears very proper just to chock
  people out of their preconceptions and point out that "Satan
  hides among you". He tends to speak in long harangues, perhaps
  not very well argumented but with a certain emotional power. Most
  regard him as overly theathric and discreetly hope he will grow
  up fast.

   Jussi is the patriarch of the
   <a href="members.html#ULV">
    Ulv family
   </a>
   , a huge old man with a
  completely bald head carrying the immense key-ring of his office.
  He is respected even by the mages, who often invite him to
  discussions dealing with affairs of the chantry. And his
  relatives in the Guild of Vulcanus always support him (and vice
  versa). He is rather dominant and generally boss around the
  people of the chantry, but he is also quite good natured and
  would never consciously hurt somebody. Usually he can be found in
  the kitchen, drinking beer and giving orders.

    : Tell jokes and stories, while
