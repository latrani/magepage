  <h1>
   Weirdness
  </h1>
  The chantry is filled with odd nooks and
  crannies, and mages who have lived there for some time get used
  to strange noises or half- seen movements in the corner of their
  eyes. At day, the place is quite calm, but at night strange
  presences appear and walking in the dark hallways becomes a quite
  eerie experience.
  <p>
   The Night People lives in the cellar. At night they roam the
  hallways, whispering secrets and hiding in the shadows. It is a
  custom that people who walk around in the chantry by night should
  have a candle or a lamp, and either walk loudly or talk to
  himself in order to warn the Night People of his approach. Nobody
  knows what will happen if somebody actually met them, but
  everyone who have heard their whisperings during dark nights
  agree that its certainly best no to find out. However, there is a
  story that if somebody places a gift to them on a certain stone
  in the cellar on the midsummer night, they will give a gift in
  return. However, if the gift doesn't appeal to them their return
  gift will be subtly cursed.
  </p>
  <p>
   The geometry of the chantry is confusing, and directly
  contradictory in places thanks to the Correspondence magick of
  previous Forcemasters. Some rooms have subtly different
  paradigms, while other rooms change their size or location
  sometimes. At certain times of the year, when Quintessence
  surges, parts of the building which has long since vanished
  return to existence. An unwary person may walk down a hallway
  only to find himself in rooms which have not existed for
  centuries. Some contain traces that somebody has been there
  recently...
  </p>
  <p>
   The third floor doesn't exist. However, it can be seen from
  the Umbra, and sometimes from the courtyard (this is usually seen
  as a bad sign). Sometimes people can be seen through the windows,
  usually believed to be the mages or servants who died in the
  great fire 1777. At certain times, especially the 5th March or at
  dangerous times for the chantry, the fire is recreated; the ages
  mix together: the chantry is filled with the smell of smoke,
  flickering flames, mages rushing through the hallways trying to
  save their books, the screams of wounded and incantations against
  the fire. Its impossible to tell what is real and what is just
  illusions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beside this, there are other temporal quirks. The windows on
  the back side of the building sometimes show people in medieval
  clothes in the street or buildings demolished long ago. It has
  happened (at least according to rumour) that mages have met other
  people in the chantry who clearly don't belong in the 20th
  century or even were themselves. There is even a story about a
  servant who left the chantry and walked halfway down Priests
  Street before he noticed that the people he met all were clothed
  in old clothes and talked medieval German.
