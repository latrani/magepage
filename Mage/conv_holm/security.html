  <h1>
   Security of the Chantry
  </h1>
  The Chantry is very
  security-minded, to the verge of paranoia. To avoid discovery by
  the Technocracy, the mages use several elaborate ruses. Foremost
  is the prohibition of ever mentioning the Convivo Holmiensis to
  anybody who is not a member. The second level of protection is an
  attempt to create red-herrings about the location of the chantry,
  mainly supported by the Virtual Adepts and Guild of Vulcanus.
  They have carefully spread hints about a chantry in Ignatius
  Alley, a few blocks away. Mages going to the real chantry should
  enter a certain building, and escape on the other side (the
  building is very narrow). The responsible mages also have creates
  some small magickal "residues", making the building appear to be
  a very carefully hidden chantry.
  <p>
   Naturally, no mage is allowed to enter the chantry if he has
  reason to think he is followed. There are also many discrete
  traps and tricks hidden along Pr√§stgatan. If a mage enters
  the northern end, stops, looks up at the left roof and then
  continues, its a sign that he is followed and that the chantry
  could come under attack. To the left of the real entrance is a
  door leading into a building owned by the Ulv family, which could
  be used if a mage thinks he is followed or want to avoid casting
  suspicion on the real entrance.
  </p>
  <p>
   Behind a water-pipe in one of the buildings there is a small
  niche. This niche traditionally contains a small dagger, and its
  also colocated to a similar niche in the wall of the Alderman's
  office. This can be used to pass messages, assistance or other
  things to mages not willing to go near the chantry.
  </p>
  <p>
   At one place along the street there is a window into a cellar
  close to the street level, with elaborate cast-iron bars. On one
  bar, there is a small barb which has been enchanted. If a mage of
  the chantry pricks his finger on it, it will activate a link
  between him and the blood from him in the Scroll of Membership.
  This makes it possible for the chantry to use magick through him
  at possible enemies or help him.
  </p>
  <p>
   The street is constantly watched by the Guild Hosts from he
  guard room by the entrance. A small mirror in the window lets
  them see the street without being seen, and the room has a
  magickal bell signalling the approach of anybody along the
  northern end of the street. The bell will ring once for each
  person approaching, and its tone and volume will tell whether the
  person is a member of the chantry and the amount of quintessence
  they bring.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Weaponsmaster has restored and built a number of traps and
  defences in or on the chantry. He has wired the electrical system
  to the bars on all windows, which makes it possible to electrify
  every metal surface on the building. In the roof of the passage
  into the chantry he has restored a medieval portcullis, which can
  drop from the ceiling, completely sealing off the first section
  of the passage. It can also be electrified, and he is currently
  demanding to open up a hole from the room above (the office of
  the secretary to the Alderman), so that magick or boiling tar can
  be poured down.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Guild Hosts are the protectors of the chantry. They are
  ten strong men who have been trained by the Weaponsmaster to
  defend the chantry (although they are hardly as fanatic about it
  as he is). They are normally not armed, but in the guard room
  there is a locked cabinet containing a few guns and a full set of
  rapiers (which are used together with the old blue uniforms at
  official duties).
  </p>
  <p>
   Beside the offensive and defensive measures, there are many
  minor details which can be used in a crisis. There is a secret
  passage from the office of the Alderman to the neighbouring
  building, and in the cellar there are the crumbling medieval
  tunnels to the royal castle, the Dominican convent and the
  waterfront. Today the latter could be used to get into the sewer
  system with some work or magick in a desperate situation. There
  are also an old door in the tower which might lead out, but
  nobody has ever tried it.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Forcemaster can also use some defensive rotes to protect
  the chantry. One of is a Correspondence 4 rote making the passage
  from the entrance lead out on the other side of the chantry
  instead of to the courtyard. A more powerful rote can dissociate
  the chantry completely from the outside, but this can be
  dangerous due to paradox and shortage of Quintessence.
