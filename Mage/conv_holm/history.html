    History of Convivo Holmiensis

  <h1>
   History
  </h1>
  Convivo Holmiensis was founded on the Midwinter
  Solstice 1346 by Cornelius Beurraeus, Sten Knutsson and Olaus
  Gripius, three hermetic mages. It was the first real chantry in
  Stockholm, then more a German city than a Swedish. The original
  location of the chantry is not known, but is believed to have
  been in the eastern side of the city, near the harbour. A few
  years afterward the Celestial Chorus founded the order of the
  White Brothers who resided in the Dominican abbey, quite possibly
  to counteract the influence of the hermetic mages. The relations
  between the groups were always a bit strained, but they seem to
  have reached an understanding not to interfere in the business of
  each other.
  <p>
   For over 150 years everything was peaceful. The White Brothers
  tended to the souls of the city dwellers while the Convivo
  studied the arcane arts and made some decent profits from trade
  with the continent. Neither group cared much for politics, which
  was a fateful mistake. When the young noble
   <a href="Mage/history.html#VASA">
    Gustaf Vasa
   </a>
   made a successful uprising against the Danish
  king, they hardly noticed. In fact, the Convivo discreetly
  supported him together with their German merchant contacts. But
  soon they began to realise something was wrong. The new king
  brought the Reformation to Sweden, began to centralise power to
  himself and administrators loyal to the king searched the lands
  for unpaid taxes, insurgents and mages. The technomancers had
  arrived.
  </p>
  <p>
   The mages were completely surprised, and lost most of their
  political power and nodes before they knew what had happened, and
  then it was too late. The Technocracy had firmly established
  itself in power. The White Brothers, hard pressed by the
  reformators sought help from the equally desperate hermetic
  mages. They joined forces, and the White Brothers joined the
  chantry 1573. Among other useful resources, the hermetic mages
  had bought the house on Priests Street in 1499 to serve as an
  escape route and warehouse (they got it cheap. The part of the
  street was called Hell and had a thoroughly bad reputation due to
  the fact that it was north of the main church). For several
  decades the mages held out while the technomancers began
  reforming society. Finally they found and destroyed the old
  chantry, and the mages scattered.
  </p>
  <p>
   For a period there were no organisation of the mages of
  Stockholm or Sweden at all. The Technocracy strengthened its
  power and went on with its business unhindered. But in 1666
  Convivo Holmiensis was founded anew by the legendary Urban
  Hiärne. Its still not clear if he really was a hermetic
  mage, he seemed to have too many contacts in the Technocracy (not
  to mention the support of the Verbena, who he had saved from the
  witch-trials by scientifically demonstrating the silliness of
  belief in witches). The chantry managed to buy back the building
  on Priest Street and quickly regained power and vitality in its
  new incarnation.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1758 a great schism arose between different groups of the
  Swedish Sons of Ether, which had until then loyally served the
  Technocracy. One group, the School of Polhem remained loyal.
  Another group, led by the original scientist and spiritist
  Emmanuel Swedenborg (and thus called the School of Swedenborg)
  broke away after the Technocracy drove their leader into exile
  for his daring and heretic ideas about the spiritual world. The
  School of Swedenborg was severely attacked, but their founder
  managed to convince several prestigious chantries on the
  continent to demand that the Convivo Holmiensis should give them
  sanctuary. Pressed and not particularly keen on the project, the
  chantry agreed. The School of Swedenborg bought half of the
  building and moved in.
  </p>
  <p>
   The relations between the School and the Convivo became more
  and more strained, until the night of the 5th March 1777, when a
  great fire almost destroyed the whole building and killed several
  people. It was probably arson, and both groups threw accusations
  on each other. But as the rebuilding took more time and money
  than expected, both groups had to cooperate and slowly learned to
  get along. On Christmas Eve 1778 the two groups formally joined
  together. The Convivo Holmiensis became divided into the Guild of
  Mercury and the Guild of Vulcanus. The chantry was led by the
  Alderman who lead a council of three Nämdemän from the
  different traditions. In essence, statutes of the chantry became
  the same as they are today.
  </p>
  <p>
   The mages of the chantry were probably involved in the
  assassination of
   <a href="Mage/history.html#GUSTAF_III">
    king Gustav III
   </a>
   in 1792, and later the rulership of
   <a href="Mage/history.html#KARL">
    Count Karl
   </a>
   by using their Masonic contacts. For a short while
  the Traditions were the power behind the throne, but they soon
  found out that administrating an entire nation was a too complex
  task and that the Technocracy was too strong, too entrenched in
  reality to be overturned. When the backlash came, it almost
  destroyed the traditions. Under the cover of civil unrest and
  chaos the Technocracy tracked down and destroyed those
  responsible, and the few survivors scattered far and wide. The
  chantry was placed in the hands of loyal sleepers and the mages
  left.
  </p>
  <p>
   Under a long period the traditions in Sweden were scattered
  and disorganised. This was the true dark times of magick in
  Sweden. In Stockholm the Rosicrucians slowly regained structure
  after their total failure. However, a fraction actually changed
  sides and joined the Technocracy. The rest became more and more
  autocratic, and was more a magickal Mafia at times than true
  seekers of Ascension. Their last leader, Erland Staaf, demanded
  total loyalty of all mages in the city and surrounded himself
  with a court not unlike a vampire prince.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally the reaction came, as a cabal of young mages united
  all other mages in open revolt against Staaf in 1900. The leading
  members were the

   <a href="Mage/conv_holm/members.html#TIBERIUS">

   , the Chorist Oscar Krook and his wife Signe
  Krook, a powerful
   <a href="Mage/roci2.html">
    Rosicrucian
   </a>
   . They surprised Staaf and drove him away. He
  promptly defected to the Technocracy and vanished without a
  trace. To this day, this sorry episode remains taboo and is not
  discussed by anybody. The mages decided to found a new chantry to
  protect themselves from the technocracy, and refounded the
  Convivo Holmiensis for the second time. The old building had
  passed through several hands, but the mages managed to buy it
  again and collect the scattered parts of most of the library.
  </p>
  <p>
   Oscar Krook was a excellent leader, and under his leadership
  the chantry prospered. When he died in 1949, he was succeeded by
  the alchemist Ernst Prahler. Prahler had already made a name on
  the continent as one of the greatest modern alchemists, and it
  was no surprise he became new Alderman. While Krook had been a
  humble and discreet leader, Prahler was powerful, egocentric and
  extremely effective. When the Technocracy destroyed Klara, the
  last bastion of the Children of Bacchus (the Cult of Ecstasy) in
  Stockholm in 1970, he personally welcomed them to form a guild in
  the chantry. Despite many protests and misgivings, the Guild of
  Bacchus was formed and the old statutes rewritten and modernised.
  However, not far afterward, Prahler died under mysterious
  circumstances. He went out for a walk, and suddenly got a fatal
  heart attack on the street outside the chantry. The official
  explanation was a paradox backlash against his powerful longevity
  potions, but dark rumours circulated.
  </p>
  <p>
   Due to the surprise of his death, the forceful Prahler was
  succeeded by his student
   <a href="Mage/conv_holm/members.html#ALDERMAN">
    Gustaf Adelswärd
   </a>
   , a skilled alchemist but by no means a
  great administrator. The politics of the chantry, which had been
  dominated by Prahler for twenty years was in turmoil. The
  instability and uncertainty persists to this day, and has slowly
  worsened as Adelswärd sinks into disease and apathy.
