   Ceremonies
  </h1>
  There are several important ceremonies each
  year. The central celebrations are on Christmas Eve, when the
  Guild Toasts takes place and on Christmas Day, when a major rite
  is performed.
  <h2>
   The Guild Toasts
  </h2>
  On Christmas Eve all mages gather in the
  Banquet Hall in their full regalia. The Guild Hosts are dressed
  in their old blue uniforms, complete with rapiers and 15th
  century helmets, gärdemännen (the tax collectors)
  collect the annual charges. The Alderman raises the chalice of
  the Guild of Mercury and toasts:
  <p>
   Sanctus to, Dominus Orbi!
   <br>
    Sanctus tu, qui naturam non creavit!
    <br>
     Sanctus tu, Maximus et Dignissimus!
     <br>
      Imperator super Lucem et Tenebrae!
      <br>
       IAO! IAO! IAO!
       <br/>
      </br>
     </br>
    </br>
   </br>
  </p>
  <p>
   Coram Yod He Vau He, Raphael, Chassan, laudamus Aerum!
   <br>
    Coram El, Mikael, Aral, benedicimus Ignem!
    <br>
     Coram Elohim, Gabriel, Taliahad, adoramus Aquam!
     <br>
      Coram Adonai ha Aretz, Uriel, Phorlakh, glorificamus
  Terram!
      <br/>
     </br>
    </br>
   </br>
  </p>
  <p>
   The Nämdeman of the Guild of Mercury the toasts:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   O Mercurius, thou winged messenger of knowledge! Bless this
    year, so that knowledge, wisdom and insight will radiate in our
    temples. Show us the way towards Enlightenment! Protect us from
    our enemies with your cunning and power!
  </blockquote>
  The Nämdeman of the Guild of Vulcanus raises
  the chalice of his guild and toasts:
  <blockquote>
   O Vulcanus, thou strong master of art! Bless this year, so that
    skill, patience and success will be in our workshops! Show us
    your secrets! Protect us from our enemies with your strength
    and power!
  </blockquote>
  The Nämdeman of the Guild of Vulcanus raises
  the chalice of his guild and toasts:
  <blockquote>
   O Bacchus, thou intoxicated host of the celebration! Bless this
    year, so that pleasure, jubilation and joy will be guests at
    our festivities! Give us ecstasy! Protect us from our enemies
    with your laughter and power!
  </blockquote>
  <h2>
   Christmas Ritual
  </h2>
  On Christmas Day all mages gather in the
  ceremony room. In the middle of the pentagram a big brazier is
  lit by the Forcemaster, who intones:
  <p>
   From fire Above to fire Below,
   <br>
    from fire Within to fire Without,
    <br>
     may the spear of Michael from There to Here
     <br>
      make the magickal fire blaze.
      <br>
       Above, Below, Within, Without,
       <br>
        blaze, fire, blaze with light!
        <br/>
       </br>
      </br>
     </br>
    </br>
   </br>
  </p>
  <p>
   The Guild of Mercury steps forward and starts to chant:
  </p>
  <p>
   Precamur vires saceris
   <br>
    Precamur elementa quattuor
    <br>
     Precamur lucem candissimum
     <br>
      Precamur in nomine Dominus.
      <br>
       Sator. Arepo. Tenet. Opera. Rotas.
       <br/>
      </br>
     </br>
    </br>
   </br>
  </p>
  <p>
   Above the fire, the Forces gather in abstract form. The Guild
  of Vulcanus steps forward and starts to chant:
  </p>
  <p>
   Luft wie weht im Blasebalg und Sturm.
   <br>
    Feuer wie wärmt im Herd und Vulkan.
    <br>
     Wasser wie kühlt Stahl und See.
     <br>
      Erde wie stützt Hause und Berg.
      <br>
       Sator. Arepo. Tenet. Opera. Rotas.
       <br/>
      </br>
     </br>
    </br>
   </br>
  </p>
  <p>
   Around the fire the Elements gather. The Guild of Bacchus
  steps forward and starts to chant:
  </p>
  <p>
   We invoke the light of Happiness!
   <br>
    We invoke the light of Lust!
    <br>
     We invoke the light of Life!
     <br>
      Radiant light, which binds together the Universe!
      <br>
       Sator. Arepo. Tenet. Opera. Rotas.
       <br/>
      </br>
     </br>
    </br>
   </br>
  </p>
  <p>
   A network of light links together the Forces, the Elements and
  the participants. The Forcemaster draws a equal-armed cross
  within a circle above the fire, symbolising balance and harmony,
  while blessing the ritual: "In the name of the Wisdom, the
  Happiness, the Justice and infinite Mercy of the eternal Spirit,
  Amen".
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Midsummer Rite
  </h2>
  The second most important rite is the
  Midsummer rite. It is usually performed somewhere outside the
  city, in close contact with nature. It celebrates the forces of
  life, growth and rebirth.
  <p>
   The Forcemaster or Nämdeman of the Guild of Bacchus
  lights a bonfire, using the incantation from the Christmas rite.
  The participants form a circle around it, and start to sing and
  dance:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   May the Midsummer fire invite the Holy Ones! Io! Io! Io! Hail,
    Mighty and the sons of Mighty! We proclaim the summer! Come and
    dance around the circle!
   <p>
    May the Midsummer fire invite the older brothers of man! Io!
    Io! Io! Hail, masters and Adepts! We proclaim the summer! Come
    and dance around the circle!
   </p>
   <p>
    May the Midsummer fire invite the spirits of the elements!
    Io! Io! Io! Hail, Fire, Air, Water, Earth! We proclaim the
    summer! Come and dance around the circle!
   </p>
   <p>
    May the Midsummer fire invite men and women, boys and girls,
    bird and fish, animals and plants! Io! Io! Io! Hail, brothers
    and sisters! We proclaim the summer! Come and dance around the
    circle!
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   The participants throw seeds and sprinkle wine on the fire and
  on the surroundings. Afterwards, the celebrations turn into a
  party. The Guild of Bacchus are naturally the most active,
  although many of the other mages participate too.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Other Ceremonies
  </h2>
  Another rite, which is still observed,
  is the Mass held on the 5th March every year in memoriam of the
  mages and servants who died in the fire 1777. The Forcemaster
  leads the prayer for their souls, and then ceremonially lights a
  single candle on the altar. On this day no fire except this
  candle is allowed in the entire chantry. Anybody found lighting
  any form of fire, regardless of station, is punished by 10 raps
  of the chantry whip.
  <p>
   Beside the main rites, which everybody attends, there are
  minor celebrations held by the different Guilds. The Guild of
  Mercury observe complex rituals at the equinoxes and
  astrologically important days. The White Brothers celebrate
  Christian holidays. The Guild of Vulcanus celebrate the birthday
  of Swedenborg. Quite naturally the Guild of Bacchus celebrate (or
  rather party) the most. They especially celebrate the 1st of May,
  the crawfish première in August and the birthday of the
  poet Bellman. Everybody is invited to attend.
