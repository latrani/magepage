  Convivo Holmiensis
  is the only chantry of the Traditions in Stockholm, at least
  according to themselves. However, they are definitely not the

    <h2>
     <a name="ROYAL">
      The Royal Institute of Technology
     </a>
    </h2>
    The
  other major (obvious) chantry is
    <a href="http://www.kth.se/index-eng.html">
     KTH, Kungliga Tekniska
  Högskolan
    </a>
    (the Royal Institute of Technology). The
  School of Polhem have supported the Technocracy for a long time,
  or rather have helped them as long as the Technocracy have
  allowed them to pursue their own experiments. This has turned out
  to be a very fruitful collaboration, as the School of Polhem have
  developed into a responsible and efficient group which have
  supplied Sweden with many useful and reasonable inventions. They
  are more engineers than mad scientists now, and their work is
  widely respected in the Technocracy. As a kind of reward for
  their work the Technocracy gave them the
    <a href="http://www.kth.se/index-eng.html">
     Royal Institute
    </a>
    (which
  also made them easier to keep track of).
    <p>
     The Institute is a large campus, centred about the main
  buildings, a large complex of medieval-looking brick buildings
  around a big courtyard. Anybody knowledgeable in the occult
  studying the layout and decorations will soon notice odd
  allegories just about everywhere; mermaids holding alchemical
  symbols, frescoes depicting mans struggle against the five
  elements and small niches with idols of half-forgotten saints.
  Before the entrance, on two pillars, stands eight guardian wolves
  in etruscean style, forming two swastikas quite obviously filled
  with power. In fact, when the institute was built in the turn of
  the century, the Technocracy-loyal fraction of the Rosicrucians
  helped design it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Technocracy has given the institute a set of powerful
  nodes tapped from one of their main ley-lines. In return the
  mages have expressed their gratitude in decorating the subway
  station at the institute; along the walls important scientific
  laws and scientists are presented (especially Copernicus, Newton
  and Gallileo), and at the four corners they have placed symbolic
  sculptures corresponding to the conventions: The Progenitors are
  represented by a Icosahedron and Water, the Syndicate with a cube
  and Earth, the New World Order with a octahedron and Air and
  Iteration X with a tetrahedron and Fire. In the centre a big
  dodecahedron hangs from the ceiling of a cupola representing the
  Void Engineers (on the floor below is a schematic drawing of the
  properties of a black hole and its influence on space-time
  superimposed on a geometric drawing of the dodecahedron,
  suspiciously like a hermetic circle).
    </p>
    <p>
     The Institute is for all practical purposes run by the School
  of Polhem under Technocracy supervision (they control the
  funding). The mages are members of the Swedish Association for
  Technological Development, housed in a discrete building on the
  campus (its logo is a simple cogwheel). The current Chairman is
  the world-renowned
     <a href="http://www.plasma.kth.se/www/info/hannes.html">
      Professor Hannes
  Alfvén
     </a>
     . The
     <a href="http://www.plasma.kth.se/alfven-lab.html">
      Alfven Laboratory
     </a>
     is responsible for the Swedish part of the Technocracy program
  for developing fusion power, and houses a small test reactor. The
     <a href="http://www.plasma.kth.se/www/info/hannes.html">
      professor
     </a>
     hopes to be able to introduce useful and economic fusion into
  consensus reality, but has begun to notice that the Technocracy
  aren't as interested as they once was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite the fact that he has been awarded with a Nobel prize
  for his research into magnetohydrodynamics, he isn't completely
  loyal to the Technocracy. He has publicly denounced nuclear power
  as dangerous, costly and an environmental hazard. He has written
  a satirical science fiction novel about the dangers of
  computerisation. And he has developed his own cosmological
  theory, which goes against all the models of the Void Engineers.
  Most of his colleagues regard him as a bit eccentric, maybe
  senile, and quietly wait for his successor. The only thing which
  keeps him safe is the strong support from the Void Engineers, who
  apparently still likes him. The Traditions have begun to become
  interested in him, and may want to try to recruit him.
    </p>
    <p>
     The School of Polhem and the School of Swedenborg have a kind
  of gentleman's agreement about not directly interfering with each
  other. In fact, they get along much better than the other
  Traditions and the Technocracy thinks. The School of Swedenborg
  mainly interfere with the projects of the Technocracy, or invent
  theories far outside of static reality, while the School of
  Polhem create socially useful inventions and theories, but not
  always what the Technocracy might want. Of course, from time to
  time individual researchers cannot resist making fun of or
  subverting their competitors theories, but this is usually more
  posturing than actual attacks. What neither group fully realises
  is that the Technocracy always seems to profit, whatever
  happens.
    </p>
    <h2>
     <a name="NULL">
      Null Pointer
     </a>
    </h2>
    This is a cabal/virtual
  chantry of Virtual Adepts centred around Scandinavian affairs.
  Its members may be anywhere, but most of its activities centre
  around finding bugs and loopholes in the Swedish system and using
  them in various ways. It can provide new identities (most
  valuable in Sweden since the system of personal numbers makes it
  harder to "disappear"), information from police computers and
  similar things.
    <p>
     They meet only virtually in a system run on the chantry
  computers with Haugen as sysop. While they officially aren't
  involved in the internal politics of the chantry (they are not
  members, and are formally not allowed to even know of its
  existence), they know a great deal. Haugen has leaked quite a
  bit, and the group are watching things. So far they haven't done
  anything, but will if necessary supply mages they support with
  help or information.
    </p>
    <p>
     The group is centred around and founded by Angel, a mysterious
  figure which so far nobody have evaded all attempts to discover
  its true identity. Angel never reveals if it is male or female,
  human, spirit or AI or where it is. Its e-mail address implies
  that its located at the uninhabited Bouvet Island in the south
  Atlantic, but that's probably only a red herring. In the web it
  manifests as a simple white sphere, always talking politely and
  exactly with people. Its goals and plans are as inscrutable as
  everything else about it. Several other members have done their
  best to trace Angel, but none have succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like most Virtual Adepts, the group is rather anarchistic and
  is run by consensus.
     <a href="Mage/conv_holm/members.html#LEVI">
      Haugen
     </a>
     is the Sysop, responsible for the hardware and most
  software of the meeting place, but anyone can download it to
  their own machines. Everybody listens to Angel, but he certainly
  isn't a leader, more a kind of advisor everyone takes with a big
  grain of salt. There are no major disagreements, since anyone not
  content with how things are run simply leaves for another team.
  But the members seldom agree on anything without fierce debate
  and detailed simulations before deciding.
    </p>
    <h2>
     <a name="TECHNOCRACY">
      Technocratic Constructs
     </a>
    </h2>
    The
  Technocracy runs Sweden from Stockholm. They have done so for 450
  years. They gradually tighten their grip more and more, slowly
  transforming the city into a tool for their total domination.
  Currently around half of the Quintessence in Sweden are drained
  by highways, powerlines and railroads and transported to
  Stockholm. The main conduits are the E4 highway (which has
  replaced the Brunkeberg-ridge as the main north-south ley-line)
  and the main railroads. They all link together in a complex web
  of infrastructure, which leads the Quintessence into the core of
  the city. Here they have demolished all previous buildings and
  created a totally technocratic area, where they have unlimited
  control.
    <p>
     Downtown, Hötorgs City, is a bleak place. The Technocracy
  doesn't care that much about appearances, and have let the area
  decay a bit. Its centrum is the plaza of Sergels Torg, a
  wasteland of concrete and glass. The plaza is cold and dirty,
  patterned in regular black and white triangles. Above it is a big
  fountain containing a big pillar of glass. This pillar is the
  focus for huge amounts of quintessence which have been patterned
  by the city, and now are broadcast across the nation again. The
  result is that the technocratic paradigm are imprinted into the
  very essence of everything in Sweden, forcing everything to obey
  the laws planned in Stockholm. Even the small villages in the far
  north look not too unlike the suburbs of Stockholm.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Traditions avoid downtown at all costs. Its a monument to
  the power of their enemies, and under constant surveillance.
  Myriads of cameras record everything, and the Technocracy
  probably watches through them.
     <a href="Mage/conv_holm/members.html#NILS">
      Nils Ulv
     </a>
     have theorised that the junkies and criminal
  elements which gather around the plaza are not always human, but
  could be camouflaged HIT-marks. Everything has a resonance of
  grey stability, squashing all thoughts about freedom and
  creativity. Consumption and conformism abounds.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Technocracy has several vital installations in the area,
  mainly underground and linked to the subway, the departments of
  the government and the main bank buildings. In the empty back
  streets of Hötorgs City many smaller constructs work,
  camouflaged as official organisations or corporations. The worst
  thing is that there is almost no difference between the
  Technocracy and the sleepers here. This is the centrum of
  Technocracy power in most of Scandinavia.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are however some other places the Traditions know are
  probably Technocracy constructs. One is Wenner-Gren Center at the
  northern end of Sveavägen avenue (which is the main ley-line
  of the city, connecting the construct with the pillar at
  Hötorgs City). Its a single skyscraper placed at an old
  node, filled with offices of minor corporations, strange
  foundations and other unknown groups. This is the centrum of the
  Syndicate. From the bar at the top floor they can look down over
  the city they run.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the other side of the city, directly south, is the tax
  department skyscraper, an imposing building in grey concrete
  placed by the second largest ley-line, Götgatan avenue. This
  is probably the headquarters of the New World Order according to
  the traditions. What they don't realise is that imposing
  buildings doesn't mean the leaders are there. The real central
  constructs are anonymous buildings nobody would notice.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Technocracy in Sweden is so powerful that it has become
  practically invisible. Its ties to the government and industry
  are so close, that there is absolutely no difference. When the
  mages of Convivo Holmiensis discuss the New World Order, they
  discuss the Government. The Syndicate is the Market. Iteration X
  is the Industry. The Progenitors are the health-care system. The
  only group not represented is the Void Engineers, who are mainly
  active in Kiruna in the far north instead. The technomancers are
  never seen. They might not even exist...
    </p>
    <p>
     The conventions, however, are very active. The most powerful
  convention is the New World Order. However, inside the convention
  there is a minor schism between one fraction of hard-liners,
  which wants to turn Sweden into an overt police-state, and the
     <a href="Mage/social_engineers.html">
      Social Engineers
     </a>
     , who has run things the last 60 years. The
  Engineers prefer a more indirect approach, and wants to create a
  society so stable and safe that no citizens will ever want
  anything else, or be able to imagine it. They would be closer to
  their goal if not the Syndicate had interfered.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Syndicate is nearly as powerful as the NWO. For a long
  time it had been slightly subordinated to the NWO political
  agenda, but now it has begun to act on its own, trying to wrest
  control over the future of Sweden from the other convention. This
  is a subtle battle, which in a typical Swedish manner isn't
  acknowledged by any side (they still cooperate excellently on
  almost all levels). The Syndicate made great progress after the
  assassination of prime minister Olof Palme, which severely
  weakened the
     <a href="Mage/social_engineers.html">
      Social Engineers
     </a>
     But the Engineers managed to regain their
  control, and now both groups discreetly manipulate events against
  each other. The only fraction which remains outside the struggle
  is the hard-liners of the NWO, who covertly support both sides
  and gain power from it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Iteration X has been allied with the NWO for a long time, so
  long in fact that it has become almost a part of it. The
  convention doesn't care about the struggles between the NWO and
  Syndicate, except that it complains that its industries get hurt
  economically by the "fluctuations". Its current main project is
  the SAAB JAS Gripen fighter plane, which is intended to usher in
  a new era of computer- assisted fighters. Unfortunately, the
  project has suffered two dramatic and very visible paradox
  backlashes, and is now very over budget. However, the NWO
  supports it, at least for the moment. They don't have any obvious
  large constructs in Stockholm.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Progenitors keep a low profile, and mainly deal with
  pharmaceutical research right now. A sizeable fraction of the
  convention has left for the NWO, where they run the sizeable
  Health Care System together with the Social Engineers (despite
  the attacks from the Syndicate). They have one of their main
  constructs at the
     <a href="http://www.mic.ki.se/ki.html">
      Karolinska Institute
     </a>
     , located
  at another ley-line (Solnavägen).
    </p>
    <p>
     The Void Engineers have very little presence in Stockholm.
  Their main interest in Sweden is
     <a href="http://aurora.irf.se/">
      Esrange Space Centre
     </a>
     in Kiruna in the
  far north. Some temporarily arrive in Stockholm to meet with the
  other conventions or the School of Polhem, but that's all.
    </p>
    <h2>
     <a name="INDEPENDENTS">
      Independents
     </a>
    </h2>
    There are few
  independent mages in Stockholm, neither tied to the Convivo
  Holmiensis, Technocracy or the Royal Institute. Few stay (or
  survive) long. There are persistent rumours of an Euthanatos
  somewhere, who discreetly kills elderly people with no friends or
  possibilities.
    <p>
     Sometimes Verbena from the countryside appear, but they
  usually avoid the city for good reasons. It embodies everything
  they fight against. They hate the Technocracy, and still remember
  how the Celestial Chorus forced Christianity onto the Swedish
  people.
    </p>
    <p>
     There have been one independent mage in Stockholm of
  international note, the author August Strindberg. His attacks on
  the establishment interested the Traditions and infuriated the
  Technocracy already when he was a sleeper. During a visit to
  Paris he experienced his so called Inferno Crisis, and awakened.
  He began alchemical and occult experiments. The Alchemists and
  School of Swedenborg were very interested in him, and wanted him
  to join, but his paranoia made him suspicious of their
  representatives. He returned to Sweden, where he apparently
  calmed down somewhat. The Traditions didn't dare to come too near
  him (besides, they were too busy fighting among themselves),
  although they tried to support him in his battles against the
  establishment. Unfortunately the Social Engineers managed to
  partially subvert him in the end, using him as a symbol for the
  growing working class movement. Despite this, many Tradition
  mages find his play "A Dreamplay" (Ett Drömspel) one of the
  most significant magickal plays ever, containing many deep
  secrets.
    </p>
    <h2>
     <a name="CONSOCIATO">
      Consociato Upsaliensis
     </a>
    </h2>
    There is
  another chantry nearby which often gets involved with the mages
  of Stockholm, in the old city of Uppsala about 50km north of
  Stockholm. In fact, Uppsala has a much longer tradition of mages
  than Stockholm, dating back of the days of the great pagan
  temple. After the defeat of Asatru, the Celestial Chorus had
  their main chantry of Sweden there, until it was destroyed by the
  reformation. Afterwards, some mages grouped around the
    <a href="http://www.uu.se/blurb_eng.html">
     university
    </a>
    and church, and
  formed a much more modest and discreet organisation which
  survives today.
    <p>
     The Consociato Upsaliensis, as they call themselves, is a
  loose alliance of mages around Uppsala. They lack any central
  chantry, but usually meet at the university. The organisation is
  much looser and smaller than the Convivo Holmiensis, and lacks
  the rigid rules. Members help each other if they wish, but they
  are not forced to. It has a leader, who is informally elected
  every tenth year. The leaders duties are mainly to represent the
  group and coordinate it in times of danger. The current leader,
  Professor Axel Vikland, is an influential
     <a href="Mage/roci2.html">
      Rosicrucian
     </a>
     of the old school, as opposed to the more
  political modern Rosicrucians like
     <a href="Mage/conv_holm/members.html#SODERBERG">
      Master Söderberg
     </a>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     The atmosphere is rather academic, and most members are from
  the Order of Hermes and School of Swedenborg. However, its the
  centrum of the remaining Swedish Choristers, who have slowly
  begun to regain strength (
     <a href="Mage/conv_holm/members.html#KROOK">
      Forcemaster
  Krook
     </a>
     often visits and helps them, although he is a bit
  worried that they might be too aggressive). The mages of the
  Stockholm and Uppsala chantries usually get along quite well, and
  its not uncommon that they visit each other or exchange
  apprentices. However, the Consociatio Upsaliensis is secretly
  wary of the Convivo Holmiensis, which they fear one day might
  attempt to try to incorporate them.
    </p>
    <p>
     They have some reason to believe this. The countryside around
  Uppsala is rich in magickal power, especially linked to the old
  pagan sites and runestones. When the Celestial Chorus took power,
  they concentrated towards the cathedral, where much of it still
  collects (unfortunately the Technocracy now run the Church, and
  they gain the Quintessence). Still, there are many nodes and holy
  sites in the area, and the Consociatio knows or controls several
  of them. Unfortunately the Technocracy isn't their only
  competitor; the pagan Children of Odin have laboured for
  centuries to gain control over many of their old holy sites, and
  sometimes mages from Stockholm seek power in the area.
    </p>
    <h2>
     <a name="KINDRED">
      The Kindred
     </a>
    </h2>
    The mages of the
  chantry don't know anything about vampires. Most don't believe
  they even exist. The older mages of the Guild of Mercury know the
  truth, and a search through the old annals might reveal a thing
  or two. The few kindred of Stockholm are adept at hiding, and
  won't let anybody find them. Most of them have never heard of
  mages either, but some of the older vampires know of the
  existence of the chantry, although not its location or exactly
  what powers the mages have.
    <p>
     The last time a kindred became involved with the mages was
  before the turn of the century, when one discreetly approached
     <a href="Mage/conv_holm/members.html#TIBERIUS">
      Tiberius de Wrang
     </a>
     . Although Tiberius have almost forgotten
  about the discussion he had with a pale stranger about the
  animating essences of life, the being have discreetly watched him
  through the years, waiting for its chance.
    </p>
    <h2>
     <a name="FAERIES">
      The Faeries
     </a>
    </h2>
    There are no faeries
  around Stockholm. The Technocracy long ago realised that cold
  iron repels them, so they built the great railroads across
  Sweden, imprisoning the faeries and other beings into the deep
  forests.
    <h2>
     <a name="WRAITHS">
      The Wraiths
     </a>
    </h2>
    The mages of Convivo
  Holmiensis have very little contact and experience of wraiths.
  There are a few haunted buildings in the old town, but nothing
  they have worried about. The only exceptions are the ghosts
  sometimes haunting the chantry, but they are quite benign and
  seem to only repeat their last actions of desperately trying to
  save the chantry from the fire. However, there have been some
  rumours among the mages about some kind of "ghost- Technocracy"
  running the afterlife. The source of these rumours or their truth
  is not known. Most mages ignore them.
