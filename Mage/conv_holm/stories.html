    The Convivo Holmiensis in Stories

  <h1>
   Using the CH in stories
  </h1>
  The Convivo Holmiensis could
  easily form the basis for a chronicle. One of the most obvious
  ways would be to have the player characters begin at the chantry
  as apprentices, and then try to advance into the hierarchy (this
  is essentially the "Retainers of a chantry" chronicle idea).
  Gradually they learn about the chantry and the quirky mages
  inside, and begin to understand some of its dark secrets.
  <p>
   Another use would be to let mages from another chantry visit
  the CH. Its not entirely forgotten by others, and some mages may
  even have visited it once. Certain traditions encourage young
  apprentices to travel to distant chantries to learn other
  perspectives on magick. Scandinavia is still very rich in
  magickal power, and what better place to start an expedition but
  CH, and its world-renowned library about Nordic magick? Another
  possibility would be that the characters are sent to secretly
  investigate about the death of Ernst Prahler: was it really a
  paradox backlash? In this case they have to pose as travelling
  mages or diplomats, while secretly trying to find out what really
  happened.
  </p>
  <p>
   A third possibility would be to have the CH as enemy. Maybe
  the characters try to create a new chantry in Stockholm,
  something many of the more conservative mages would dislike
  intensely. The players could be members of the
   <a href="Mage/conv_holm/others.html#CONSOCIATO">
    Consociato Upsaliensis
   </a>
   , trying to stave of the approach of
  Stockholm mages, the Verbena and Technocracy. Or maybe the
  characters are technomancers, trying to find and eliminate the
  tenacious mages of Stockholm. And what about the renegade
  Rosicrucians? Do they still exist?
  </p>
  <h2>
   Story Ideas
  </h2>
  There is something rotten... : The players
  come upon some of the old secrets certain mages want to keep
  hidden. It could be the renegade Rosicrucians, or the
  transgressions of Prahler... or his death. Will they preservere
  digging in old scandals, even if the Masters disapprove and
  unknown mages try to sabotage the investigations? And is the
  truth more important than the continued functioning of the
  chantry?
  <p>
   The Quest for Tass: The chantry is low on Quintessence, and
  the supply is slowly strangled by the Technocracy. The characters
  must find new sources... somewhere. The problem is of course that
  the ley-lines and nodes of Stockholm has all been exploited by
  the Technocracy. Or are there some left? The players may have to
  find creative and dangerous solutions to find the
  Quintessence.

   God and Plasma: Will
   <a href="http://www.plasma.kth.se/www/info/hannes.html">
    Professor Hannes
  Alfven
   </a>
   of the School of Polhem defect? The Masters want to
  know, and want the characters to investigate. Its dangerous,
  since the Technocracy watches his every move, but could be worth
  it. His theories about fusion could mean a renaissance of cheap
  and safe energy... and unlimited Quintessence released from the
  fusion reactions. They could also spell the doom of reality as we
  know it, if one is to believe a series of prophetic nightmares
  which haunt
   <a href="Mage/conv_holm/members.html#SIMON">
    Master Keijser
   </a>
   . He thinks a working fusion reaction might
  burn through the Horizon and start a chain reaction where reality
  unravels into Quintessence. Alfven would only laugh at the
  prospect, and point to the fact that fusion is self-limiting. Is
  the professor an ally, or is he more dangerous than everybody
  thinks? And how will the White Brothers deal with a man who sees
  Quintessence, the essence of the One, as something which could be
  described by second-order partial differential equations and
  controlled with magnetic fields?
  </p>
  <p>
   The King is dead, long live...? : The Alderman finally dies.
  Who will succeed him?
   <a href="Mage/conv_holm/members.html#SODERBERG">
    Nämdeman Söderberg
   </a>
   is the logical and formal
  successor, but nobody likes him.
   <a href="Mage/conv_holm/cabals.html#CONSERVATIVES">
    The Conservatives
   </a>
   wants one of their own as Alderman, or at
  least a controllable Alderman. On the other hand, they would
  never risk doing anything unethical and the only formally correct
  way they could get one of their own close to the office is by
  having the
   <a href="Mage/conv_holm/members.html#TIBERIUS">
    Magister
   </a>
   or
   <a href="Mage/conv_holm/members.html#KROOK">
    Forcemaster
   </a>
   step down, an administrative impossibility. And
  the choice of a new Nämdeman of the Guild of Mercury is even
  worse. There is no candidate anybody wants. The young and radical
  mages see their chance, and the Virtual Adepts of
   <a href="Mage/conv_holm/others.html#NULL">
    Null Pointer
   </a>
   will support them in their bid for renewal...
  which will make all the Masters join together against them. This
  is war, waged with rules, old statutes, formalism and diplomacy.
  The winner will be the one who can bend the rules without
  breaking them.
  </p>
  <p>
   Stockholm by Night: Of some reason, the vampires of Stockholm
  has taken an interest in the mages. Various factions of vampiric
  society try to gain power over the mages or the cabals, using
  them as pawns against each other and their enemies. This can
  range from subtle manipulations of individuals over threats to
  direct attacks and the Blood Bond. The mages don't know much
  about vampires, but the vampires seems to know a lot about the
  mages... or do they? The mages must survive the secret game where
  they don't know the rules, can't see the players and don't know
  the goals.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Heart of Darkness: A member of the chantry has been
  incautious, and the Technocracy has arrested him. All available
  resources must be used to prevent them from learning about the
  identity of the other mages and the chantry. The players have to
  journey into the grey and cold heart of the city to find their
  friend, before it is too late.
  </p>
  <p>
   A Matter of Public Opinion: The characters become involved in
  the latest Technocracy attempt to strengthen their control over
  the city and its inhabitants. It could be a new highway, which
  would seal off most of the city from any natural source of
  Quintessence. It could be the public demand for a safer city and
  more law and order which will lead to a stronger police and more
  surveillance. It could be the proposed railway, which would
  re-route the Quintessence of the chantry directly to Downtown.
  The characters have to avert the danger, by manipulating public
  opinion, cutting through red tape and somehow overcome the
  bureaucracy. And somewhere out there among the faceless experts
  and politicians, the Technocracy waits...
  </p>
  <p>
   Nature Holiday: What about the rural areas of Sweden? There
  are many mysteries even the Swedish mages don't know about. Does
  the faeries still live in the deep forests? Why does the
  Technocracy have such problems with the area around Sundsvall?
  What are the Void Engineers doing around Kiruna? What about the
  sightings of strange wolves in Jämtland? What is the real
  cause of the "Russian submarines" in the archipelago of
  Stockholm? And does paganism still survive in some backwaters?
  The characters may not like the answers...
