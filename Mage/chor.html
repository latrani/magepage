   Choronzon, also known as 333, Lord of Hallucinations, is one of
  the most feared umbrood in existence. Many mages have fallen prey
  to its cunning plans, and its power can't be ignored. It is a
  preceptor, which some claim is one of the Wyrm's most dangerous
  servants. Other mages whisper that it is a part of Wyrm capable
  of independent action. Some mages claim Choronzon
   <em>
    is
   </em>
   the
  Wyrm. The truth is not known. Choronzon appears to sometimes be a
  group of entities, and sometimes a single entity (My name is
  Legion).
   <p>
    Choronzon is a spirit of dissolution, physical, mental and
  spiritual. Everything around it will begin to decay. It will do
  its best to hasten the dissolution of everything it can reach.
  Matter will slowly dissolve. Living beings will age and sicken.
  It derails the trains of thought, and turns people insane. In the
  vicinity of it, nothing remains untainted.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is said that every mage must some day confront and overcome
  it in order to ascend. Choronzon will do its best to hinder
  anybody from reaching Ascension or any other goal. Its greatest
  triumph is when a mage loses Arete. On December 6, 1909 Aleister
  Crowley foolishly let himself be possessed by the demon (Se Liber
  XXX Aerum, The Vision and the Voice, for more detailed
  descriptions). The end result was close to a disaster, and
  according to many mages Crowley lost the path towards
  Ascension.
   </p>
   <p>
    Choronzon is confused and often quite stupid. But it is also
  extremely cunning and dangerous. It can manipulate people subtly
  while appearing to make crude attacks. The demon will almost
  always retreat from any attack, not even defending itself. But it
  will never give up, and will reappear later, in a more insidious
  form. The only thing it cannot abide is order and discipline. Any
  form of highly ordered thought, speech or behavior is abhorrent
  to it, and it will flee if possible (unless it could topple the
  order in a subtle way).
   </p>
   <p>
    The demon seldom appears threatening to a mage. Instead it
  appears to be a quite confused and irritating little being,
  unable to do much harm. In fact, it often behaves entertainingly,
  incoherently discussing things that seem important to the mage.
  While the mage listens to the confusing demon, it will slowly
  plant the seeds of dissolution in the soul of the mage. Choronzon
  will strengthen the flaws and illusions in the victim, making the
  victim believe in his own self image. As the demon works on, the
  mage will be derailed from the path towards Ascension and turned
  towards dissolution and insanity. A mind infected by Choronzon
  will slowly decay, and the victim will be a simple matter to
  possess for the demon, regardless how strong-minded the victim
  believes he is.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is thought that Choronzon dwells somewhere near The
  Horizon, in an area known as the Abyss (Which could be another
  name for the Deep Umbra). According to some rumors, he must be
  defeated by anyone venturing out into the Deep Umbra searching
  for a place among the Oracles.
   </p>
   <p>
    To summon Choronzon is quite simple, almost any fool with
  Spirit 2 can do it. It sometimes acts as a kind of freelance
  paradox spirit, appearing when a mage has used spectacular
  entropy-prime effects. In many cases it has secretly encouraged
  the mage to continue, thus spreading entropy even more.
   </p>
   <p>
    Choronzon very seldom manifests physically, preferring to
  possess people. It does this with great skill, making his victims
  think they are in perfect control over their own minds. When it
  does manifest, it will only appear as a voice. Sometimes it will
  manifest using many bodies and voices, giving the impression of a
  great horde of demons.

    Typical Effects:
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Dissolve Structure (Prime 4 Entropy 3/4/5)
    </b>
    Choronzon
  initiates decay wherever he goes. This effect will make anything
  start to dissolve into nothing. Most of the time it uses this
  effect coincidentally, preferring to let dissolution take its
  time. Sometimes Choronzon dissolves things quickly, often for no
  reason. The process is subtle, but when initiated it cannot be
  stopped except by more powerful magick. The dissolution slowly
  spreads, turning matter into dust which blows away and
  disappears, killing life and making people slowly go insane.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Dissolve Mind (Entropy 5 Mind 2)
    </b>
    Choronzon implants a
  destructive, irrational or confusing impulse in the mind of
  someone. This impulse will not go away, but will slowly grow
  until it becomes an obsession. Usually Choronzon implants
  distortions in the self image, turning people into unknowing
  caricatures of themselves. Sons of Ether will slowly become
  complete egomaniacs. Celestial Chorus will slowly become
  fanatics. Choronzon will quickly become even more confused.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Sow the Seed of Entropy (Entropy 3/4/5 Prime 2)
    </b>
    The
  demon plants a small entropy seed inside something or someone.
  Most of the time it will remain there, unchanging but when
  stressed, it will release its entropy. A rope will suddenly break
  when someone's life depends on it, a horse will bolt, a mirror
  will crack and faith will momentarily crumble in a crisis.
  Choronzon does not have any control over these seeds, but spreads
  them liberally.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Confused Knowledge (Mind 3)
    </b>
    The demon is almost
  constantly using this effect. It opens the user's mind to every
  other mind in the area, especially nearby ones. The user will
  know everything anybody knows, feel every desire and fear and
  generally understand the secret motivations of people.
  Unfortunately the user is completely confused, and his own
  personality and knowledge is submerged. This doesn't matter to
  Choronzon, who hasn't got much personality in the first place.
  Using this rote, the demon will always talk about things that
  interest the listener, have beliefs somewhat like his and a
  uncanny way of revealing the deepest secrets of a person in an
  offhand way.
