   This powerful paradox spirit is rarely seen, but greatly feared
  by those few mages who know of his existence. The Judge is
  generally believed to be connected to the sphere of Prime, but
  can appear from the misuse of just about any type of True Magick.
  Only the most powerful offenses against the laws of reality are
  enough to warrant his attention. In fact, some mages believe that
  the Judge will only punish "evil" uses of magick, though the
  definition of "evil" seems to be based off of the common
  consensus of morality rather than some absolute standard. It is
  said that the Judge sometimes notices horrific non-magickal
  violations moral "laws" as well, either those of man or nature.
   <p>
    Once a mage has attracted the Judge's attention, he is
  implacable in prosecuting his victim, but not always swift.
  Often, he will haunt the hapless mage with visions of past crimes
  and her upcoming judgement. At first, the Judge will alter the
  mage's dreams, forcing the mage to relive her "crimes", often in
  the role of the bystanders or victims of the event. Next, the
  Judge will create a series of minor incidences in the mage's
  life, to remind her of her trespass against reality.
   </p>
   <p>
    Only when the mage is truly terrified, dreading her fate, will
  the Judge finally appear. The Judge always stands at least a foot
  taller than the mage in question, with a stern and jagged face
  and short cropped white hair, bald in the center. He usually
  wears flowing robes of a deep purple hue, with a gold-bordered
  white sash thrown over his shoulders. He carries an elaborate
  wooden staff of office, carved with the Hermetic symbols of the
  nine spheres. He is completely resistant to the use of anything
  short of Oracular magick.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Judge will reveal himself, and his nature, and give the
  mage a few minutes to gather whatever materials she may need for
  her defense during the trial. This includes any witnesses the
  mage needs to call, such as the mage's companions. The mage will
  be whisked off to a barren Paradox realm for her trial, where she
  will remain until her fate is decided. Any witnesses for the
  defense will be guaranteed safe passage.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Judge brings the mage before a tribunal of nine mysterious
  cloaked and shrouded figures, who will remain silent throughout
  the trial. The tribunal floats in a circle surrounding the
  proceedings. The exact trial varies in style, and often drawing
  on elements of the legal system most familiar to the mage. The
  Judge states the charges against the mage, and the mage has an
  opportunity to defend herself.
   </p>
   <p>
    Often the charges are undeniable, that the mage caused a some
  sort of irreparable breach in reality. The only viable defense is
  to convince the tribunal of the validity of that breach, and the
  mage's worth as a mover of reality. Though never explicitly
  stated, the trial is not about the mage's Paradox "crime", but
  about whether the she is effective at altering and improving
  reality.
   </p>
   <p>
    The mage may have his witnesses speak for him, but the Judge
  has the opportunity to cross-examine them, working to undermine
  their claims and their reliability as an unbiased witness. The
  Judge may also bring forth witnesses against the mage, who appear
  in the court at his beckoning; the Judge's power is great enough
  to call forth the dead. Witnesses for the prosecution seem to be
  in a dazed state, and never remember the experience.
   </p>
   <p>
    The trial proceeds with statements and rebuttals from both the
  prosecution and the defense until at some point the tribunal of
  nine rises. This is the sign that the tribunal has reached its
  decision. At this time, all witnesses are returned to wherever
  they came from, and only the mage, the Judge and the nine remain.
  The nine intone their decision, and if found innocent, the mage
  is returned to her home. No one knows what becomes of mages that
  are found guilty, but they are never seen again.
