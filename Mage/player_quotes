Some more player quotes from my current chronicle:

There is wisdom in this pizza.

Paradox is your friend.

Botch is beautiful.

- Goetic mages are not evil by principle.
- Only in practice.

- It doesn¹t work.
- *Nothing* has ever worked in our chantry.

- WHAT? You are cautious for once?
- I¹m possessed by a demon!

The horror is that he knows what he is doing.

When travelling back in time with a SoE:
- When was the phonograph invented?
- Now, if you like it.

Naughty, naughty Storyteller!

- I¹m a hermetic, I have respect for the bible.
- I¹m a Chorist, and I think it is full of shit.

In the car:
- I¹ve got Forces-Paradox...
- No! Not here!
- But I have to!

- No, I don¹t want to copulate with imaginary people. 
- That gladdens me. I have been around idiots far too long.

They should not be victimised, even if they are just imaginary 
people.

When the female VA began to think about creating a cyborg child:
- Dreams should be in your heart, not in your womb.

At the hermetic bookstore:
- Do you have Krarechxxqkk?
- No, but we will get it next week.

- You have given him the key to total power!
- Cool!

- He is a demon lord!
- That doesn¹t necessarily mean he is evil.

- You really want to live in the 19th century.
- Rather the 14th.

We live in a free society where everybody has equal rights, even 
demon lords.

- Just because I¹m a woman you think I do stupid things.
- We think you do stupid things because you are you.

We are no maniacs, we are completely rational idiots.

- How did he feel after you chopped off his head?
- Angry.

Angels are parsimonious. Demons are greedy.

Liquid mescaline? I thought it was moonshine, and mixed it with 
my cola!
