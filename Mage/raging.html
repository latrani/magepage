   The Temple of The Raging God
  </h1>
  <i>
   by Anders Sandberg

  <blockquote>
   We had come to seek the Raging God, but so far I had mostly
    seen an incomprehensible jumble of places, pictures, sounds and
    ideas. Inviolata called it the purity of experience, and said
    it was really just a new way of seeing the world that was much
    truer than the ordinary one-dimensional perspective. Personally
    I thought she made it up as she went on, just as she made up
    the way we travelled by mumbling free associations and throwing
    her bible pages into the air. Of course she was insane, and I
    was just as mad - but at least she made the Things go away.
   <p>
    Suddenly she stopped, whirled around towards me and shouted
    "Glory be to those who build their houses on sand!". She threw
    a couple of fluttering pages at me, and the view cleared. We
    were standing in a nightly desert. A breathtaking place: rocks
    and dunes stretching forever beneath a sky so clear and sharp
    that the stars felt painful, and lit up by flickering auroras:
    red, green, purple.
   </p>
   <p>
    "So, is this the home of the Raging God?" I asked, somewhat
    relieved by the normality of the place. Inviolata just laughed,
    and began to skip across the dunes. Tired, hungry and afraid
    that They would appear even here (are there any places safe
    from Them?) I followed her.
   </p>
   <p>
    Just a few hundred meters away, we suddenly came upon a
    structure. One moment I was limping after the maniac Inviolata
    in an empty valley, and the next we were standing just before a
    huge cubical building. The stone was black as space itself,
    dimly reflecting the auroras and our shadows in a way that it
    shouldn't. I think I would have noticed it long before we got
    this close. Inviolata didn't care, she just burst out in some
    kind of benediction and began to search along its side.
   </p>
   <p>
    The entrance was a big block of solid steel, cold to the
    touch and with no hinges. In the middle there was a depression
    shaped like a hand. Inviolata asked me: "So, do you really want
    to behold the face of the Raging God, my son? Do you want to
    know the fire in the equations?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Will it drive away the Things?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "No, YOU will drive away them. Once you have awakened the
    wild power in yourself - by basking in the fire of God". She
    pressed her hand into the depression, and ripples spread over
    the metal. She stepped into it as if it was a liquid, leaving
    me alone. I hesitated just for a moment, already hearing the
    wailing of the Things from the desert. Fearful, I put my hand
    into the depression (it fit perfectly), and felt something
    inside me move, dissolving the strength of the steel. Holding
    my breath I stepped through the cold metal liquid...
   </p>
   <p>
    ... and emerged from a liquid metal rectangle set in the
    face of a jet- black cubical building standing in a desert. The
    stones were identical, even our tracks in the sand looked
    exactly like on the other side. But the sky, oh the sky! It was
    fire and light and power - a wild and untameable power raging
    against the tame reality outside. It was beyond life,
    sentience, stability. Pure divinity. I fell to my knees beside
    Inviolata to worship the Raging God.
   </p>

  Marauders are not known for their religiosity, so
  the Temple comes as a much greater surprise to everyone who
  encounter it.
  <p>
   The Temple is located in the High Umbra, said to lie not far
  from the Shard realm of Forces. From the outside, the Temple is a
  forbidding cube of black stone, standing in an immense nighttime
  desert lit by constant auroras. Its surface seems to reflect
  shadows a few seconds after they had occurred, warping them and
  giving them a life on their own.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Entrance is a simple rectangular opening flanked by two
  heavy pillars. The door is a single massive steel slab absolutely
  impossible to move without superhuman strength. At the centre
  there is a depression, a handprint in the metal surrounded by
  concentric circles. If visitors places their hands there, all
  Paradox is suddenly drained and the steel becomes liquid for
  them, allowing entrance.
  </p>
  <p>
   The interior is also the exterior - visitors emerge from a
  rippling steel surface set in the face of a cubical temple
  identical to the first, set in a desert landscape similar to the
  landscape on the outside (inside?). But here it is day - the
  entire sky burns with a fierce light as if it every part of it
  was the sun. The light twists and turns, erupts and reforms in
  unimaginable ways, sometimes sending down streamers of power that
  almost hit the ground before arching back.
  </p>
  <p>
   The desert is hotter than any earthly desert, and farther away
  from the Temple it becomes more and more impassable and
  dangerous. It is as if it moved closer to the raging sky, and the
  stones began to reflect its fierceness. And the Presence of the
  Raging God becomes ever stronger.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Raging God is the supreme manifestation of the wildness of
  existence, the intensity of being and non-being that cannot be
  tamed or limited. It has no form, no goal, no allegiance, just
  sheer Will. It is the blazing sky of the Temple-desert, the
  sharpness of the rocks, the hate and love between the sky and
  ground. Anybody in the realm will begin to reflect it, becoming
  wild and powerful.
  </p>
  <p>
   Many Marauders have made pilgrimage to the Temple, to gaze
  with awe upon the manifestation of the God. Few could resist the
  temptation to wander farther out into the desert; some died, but
  several reached their destination and merged with the God at the
  horizon in ecstatic union.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Story ideas
  </h3>
  A group of Marauders have had a vision
  uniting their Quiets: they will set the Raging God free from its
  temple. Together they begin to travel to the realm and to seek
  for the means of permanently open the portal between the inside
  and outside.
  <p>
   Disturbing new images and ideas are appearing in rock videos,
  suggesting to knowledgeable (high Cosmology) mages that someone,
  or something, in the music industry is aware of the Raging God.
  Who? And why? Is somebody trying to create a true cult of the
  God? Or is it a Syndicate plot to make money on Its power,
  rendering it a saleable symbol for middle-class teenage
  rebellion?
  </p>
  <p>
   A Master needs rocks infused with the essence of the Raging
  God for his supreme ritual. Guess who is sent to fetch them as
  payment for their education? Right.
