There is a realm known among mages of the Batini, and houses Shaea and 
Jannisary. it has gone by many names down through the mists of 
antiquity, some have called it Rhagadosia, some have named it Khalat al 
Magat, but most know of it by it’s more colloquial name...The Turgid 
Places.
  The Turgid places was created as a realm of punishment by incarna of 
the Egyptian Court.  It began as a place where rebellious spirits would 
be consigned and those who had failed their masters would be tossed 
there for an indefinite time. Other incarna seeing the effectiveness of 
this, have created similar realms with similar characteristics.
  The realm resembles a very large sphere of shiny clear liquid.(for 
those of you who have seen the movie “Stargate” it is much like the 
liquid in the gate.) The sphere trembles and joggles in place as if were 
held together only by surface tension. Suspended within the realm are 
the clearly visible ephemera of any spirits trapped there up to a 
distance of 10 feet or so. After ten feet in the spirits are less 
visible.
   Spirits trapped within the sphere are ungoing a hideous form of 
torture. allthough it is not discernable from the outside the sphere 
contains a very strong tidal force that slowly tears the ephemera of any 
creature trapped within apart and then forcibly reforms it. this process 
takes about an hour. Because of the nature of this force and the pain 
involved,any spirit of less than incarna level that become trapped here 
are unable to leave under their own steam. Incarna level spirits have 
been trapped here as well but they are almost allways able to win free. 
It may take months, it may take years but they almost allways are able 
to tear free.(and boy will they be pissed.)
  The only ways for a spirit to be released from this bondage is to be 
summoned forth, (this is simple requiring only the name of the spirit 
and Spirit 2) To promise service to someone who can scry within the 
realm( also pretty easy, requiring only Correspond-ence 4 and spirit 2) 
or to have someone physically lead them out of the realm.
(very hard, you’ll see why in a moment.)
  Mages and Garou who would visit this place should be aware of a few 
things. for one, they are also subject to the tidal forces within and 
will suffer 1 health level every 5 minutes they stay within the 
realm.(once dissipated, the visitor then regains 1 health level every 
five minutes.) it require either the Concentration merit or a point of 
willpower to manage to work any kind of magick or gift at all. Mages and 
Garou who end up spending any amount of time(say a few days)  here being 
torn apart and put back together will gain a serious 
derrangement.(hydrophobia is usual.) Gates into and out of the realm 
erode at a rate of one magickal success per minute and those wishing to 
pierce the gauntlet of the realm from the inside must make 7 successes 
against a 9 difficulty. Mages and garou should also be made aware that 
touching the exterior of the realm is a good way to get dragged in by 
the surface tension.( one would the think that high level forces magick 
might be enough to fragment this realm. sadly, that is not the case.)
  The only way to safely interact with this realm is through scrying 
gates and combinations of Correspondence and spirit.(such magick is easy 
in comparison requiring only knowledge of where such realms are and 4 
successes.)
     Spirits trapped within this place will promise nearly anything to 
be free of it, and in many cases this means that such spirits can be 
coerced into servitude. however it should be noted that many of these 
spirits were put here for a reason. Some might pervert the terms of 
service while others might have angry masters who seek them out.
    Consigning a spirit to the Turgid places is a ticklish thing for 
mages. Mages who threaten spirits with consignment there had best be 
able to back it up or the spirit will find out. Those who actually do 
consign a spirit to the turgid places had better expect that the spirit 
will be an undying enemy forever and will get as many of his friends to 
help with bedeviling the mage. It should be noted that some communities 
of spirits are very close knit and will come the aid of a trapped 
spirit. This is why attempting to trap Paradox spirits in this realm is 
an incredibly bad idea. Trap a Hawk Jaggling here and you’d better be 
prepared to have trouble with other Hawk spirits from then on.
   Many of the denizens of the turgid places are inept spirits or 
actively malevolent spirits. Such include: demons of all sorts, 
Rhakshasi,cranky Elementals, Cranky Djinn,Efreet,Marids,and Dao, Disease 
spirits and spirits of madness,Various banes, Mad perceptors, and other 
such. (it should be noted that ghosts cannot be trapped here.)
   The interior of the realm appears to be entirely featureless and 
without gravity. although atmosphere appears to be liquid it is still 
ephemera and is breathable as usual. Characters that are stuck without 
some means of propulsion drift lazily unless dragged into one the 
currents which will toss them about quite a bit. Seeing in the realm is 
akin to seeing underwater and words tend to be somewhat garbled.(making 
communication with other spirits a bit difficult but not impossible. 
Strangely, this is not a problem when speaking to a spirit through a 
gate.
