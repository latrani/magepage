   The Chaos Butterfly (Entropy 2)
  </h1>
  <i>

  <p>
   This paradox being is the manifestation of all small things
  that make a large difference, the unpredictable randomness that
  always brings down complex plans. Usually it appears to mages who
  control randomness too much, and give them a taste of the random
  in life. It has even manifested in the digital web, causing
  trouble for the Virtual Adepts.
  </p>
  <p>
   The butterfly is a normal sized yellow butterfly, with the
  edges of the Mandelbrot-set decorated wings serrated in a fractal
  pattern.
  </p>
  <p>
   Usually it just flitters around inconspicuously, but in a
  critical situation it might land on a vital part or flap its
  wings. It has the power to cause a tiny disruption that will have
  great and unexpected consequences. When a hermetic mage draws his
  elaborate magickal circle, the butterfly might discreetly land
  and erase one line with its wings, causing the ritual to
  backfire. It lands on a dial of a Son of Ether gizmo, upsetting
  its delicate calibration. As a Verbena tries to brush it aside,
  she accidentally tips over a powerful potion into her cauldron.
  It flies over a gaming table, distracting the players, which
  changes the outcome of the game despite the attempts of a mage to
  control it.
  </p>
  <p>
   The butterfly sometimes makes a powerful attack against a mage
  by causing a lot of random events conspire against him. As the
  mage drives to his chantry, the driver in the car before sneezes
  (because of butterfly dust in the air) and brakes unexpectedly,
  making the mage run into him. The brakes on the car behind him
  doesn't work properly (because the repairman was distracted by an
  unusual butterfly), and it crashes into him too. And it happens
  to be filled with Men in Black on their way to an important
  meeting...
  </p>
  <p>
   Weather control: Yes, the chaos butterfly has the ability to
  control the weather in the future. Since it never does anything
  it is told, this is of limited utility.
  </p>
  <p>
   There are stories about how mages who misuse entropy too much
  get visited not by the chaos butterfly, but by millions of them.
  This massive entropy paradox backlash leaves a devastated place
  where just about everything went wrong.
