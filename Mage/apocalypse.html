    The Horsemen of the
  Apocalypse

   <p>
    The Horsemen of the Apocalypse is a group of mages dedicated
  to the downfall of the Technocracy and modern civilization. They
  have realised that it is corrupt to the core, and the only way to
  save humanity is to purge the disease before it hardens the
  paradigm forever.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Horsemen was founded shortly before the turn of last
  century. A group of mages, watching how the Technocracy was
  reshaping the world using the Industrial Revolution, realised
  that modern civilisation was sick, and would in the long run only
  lead mankind into a blind alley, from which escape and eventual
  Ascension was impossible. People were turned more materialistic,
  rational and deeply asleep for every day. The only way to stop
  this, and to return to a more primal state of being, was to
  destroy civilisation. Through the cleansing fire of this
  catastrophe, mankind would be given a second chance. A few of the
  most devoted and knowledgeable mages founded the Horsemen of the
  Apocalypse to achieve this goal.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Horsemen soon realised that the only way to defeat the
  Technocracy was to use their own methods against them. The
  technomancers had carefully planned against any form of magickal
  attack, but one using their own paradigm would be much harder to
  stop, since that would require the technomancers to fight their
  own paradigm. The mages of the group decided to use the upcoming
  war as their tool of Armageddon. They carefully extrapolated
  developments in weapons technology, economics and magick, and
  came to the conclusion that the World War would quite possibly
  spell the end of civilization in Europe, taking the Technocracy
  down with it. They set to bring it about, manipulating people and
  nations to make the war as destructive as possible.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unfortunately they were wrong in their predictions, or they
  failed somehow. The War to End All Wars bogged down into the
  trenches, and soon became just a matter of attrition. The
  Horsemen lost their fire, and while the chaos and changes in the
  aftermath temporarily gave the Traditions some new chances, the
  group more or less disbanded.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, during the Second World War, some of the old members
  began to realise what was about to happen. They intuited some of
  the plans of the Technocracy, and realisedthat It planned to
  divide the world between the Superpowers. They also realised the
  awesome potential of nuclear energy long before the sleeper
  scientists did. The Horsemen reformed, and set to the work of
  helping the Technocracy with the Cold War. Now they were a much
  more powerful organisation, their leaders were both experienced
  and pragmatic and their mundane assets quickly began togrow,
  using the remains of the intelligence network of the old
  group.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Cold War was a masterstroke from the Technocracy. By
  pitting the superpowers against each other, they forced both
  sides to develop more and more advanced technology, to ursup more
  power from lesser nations and impose their own ideas on them.
  This suited the Technocracy perfectly, who was the puppet master
  behind the scene. The nuclear weapons were intended as the basis
  for this structure, and was never intended to be used except as
  deterrence and as a possible way to scare the Traditions into
  submission. But the Horsemen sabotaged the plan, and the arms
  race got out of control. Their agents inside the military and
  intelligence community spread paranoia and revanchism, and by
  leaking information between the superpowers they encouraged the
  development of the arms race. Soon the Technocracy had to adapt
  to the new situation, and they had to plan for a world with
  superpowers engaged in an eternal race of destruction. That
  wasn't so bad, although some technomancers disliked the
  instability of the situation.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Horsemen waited for the spark which would ignite the
  apocalypse. During the Cuba Crisis they were almost sure it would
  happen, and they didn't use all their forces to finally push the
  world over the edge to nuclear war because they were so sure it
  would start by itself. Unfortunately, the Technocracy intervened
  and the crisis was averted. The next major crisis, the "Jewel
  Crisis" 1980 (which was never made public), was so close that the
  Technocracy had to use magickal sabotage to prevent the automatic
  launching of hundreds of missiles as the American systems went
  haywire. This time, a few of the agents and members of the
  Horsemen had to be terminated to prevent discovery.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unfortunately, the Horsemen failed to cause nuclear holocaust,
  and as the Syndicate pulled the plug on the East Block, their old
  plans were similarly thrown into chaos. They could no longer
  count on direct means, and their goal seemed further away. For a
  short period the Horsemen aimlessly supported whatever groups and
  phenomena they thought could start the Third World War, but they
  lacked unity and coordination. But then they found new strength
  and direction as their new Central Coordinator, the Euthanatos
  Georgios Papadimitriou created the Millennium Project.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Millennium was a radical new idea. Instead of just trying
  to make the historical developments of the Technocracy to fail
  catastrophically, the Horsemen will try to cause the Apocalypse
  themselves by subverting technocratic reality. This goal will be
  brought about using a complex strategy, involving many mutually
  enforcing factors. One one hand, the Horsemen have started to
  develop their already sizeable economical assets into a huge but
  invisible economic force, with ties into almost every nation and
  industry. Their network of agents infiltrate both political,
  military and intelligence agencies, but also education, religious
  groups and society in general. Some members work inside the
  Traditions, supporting the Ascension War. Others work as double
  agents, leaking information to the Technocracy.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Horsemen are planning to increase social, economical and
  military tensions slowly, using whatever methods works. At the
  same time they try to heat up the Ascension War, forcing the
  Technocracy to turn more and more repressive and direct itself
  against fighting the Traditions instead of securing their
  reality. Around the year 2000, when the world should be
  completely out of the Recession according to Syndicate plans, the
  Horsemen suddenly will pull the plug. Their financial empires
  will collapse overnight, taking the international stockmarkets
  and monetary systems with them. Multinational Corporations and
  whole nations will be ruined overnight. The chaos on the market
  will be amplified by their agents and the paranoia and
  insecurity
    <br>
     they have sown.
    </br>
   </p>
   <p>
    At the same time, the agents inside youth gangs and criminal
  organisations will cause even more chaos as the international
  drug market collapses and a crimewave of titanic proportion
  causes widespread destruction. Terrorist groups suddenly strike
  using chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. Agents in
  intelligence and military organisations will initiate conflicts
  and make leaders make hasty and unwise decisions. Religious cults
  will proclaim the Apocalypse to the masses. The assassins of the
  Horsemen will terminate popular leaders, celebrities and
  important people. The Technocracy will be completely surprised,
  and
    <br>
     their reaction will only worsen things. The world will be plunged
  into complete chaos and destruction. If this succeeds, the
  resulting chaos will soon escalate as war, pestilence and famine
  ravage the world. This will hopefully destroy the Technocracy and
  modern civilisation.
    </br>
   </p>
   <p>
    Today the Horsemen work silently and efficiently on the
  Millennium Plan. To implement it, they use minimal magick and
  relies instead on use of the Technocracy paradigm, which is much
  harder for the enemy to discover. Limited divination in the form
  of financial forecasting is used to invest their huge wealth,
  Mind is camouflaged as advertisements and psychology and is used
  to manipulate people, and experience from the CIA and KGB is used
  to build the huge networks of the agents the Horsemen use. Of
  course, this raises the risk that the Horsemen are slowly
  becoming more and more like their enemies, and such accusations
  are not entirely unfounded.
   </p>
   <p>

      Organization:
     </span>
    </b>
    <br>
     <br>
      The Millennium Project is so huge and secret that it requires
  very careful administration. Each mage in the Horsemen controls a
  tiny part or runs a special project, often with many subordinates
  and with no overall knowledge. These are coordinated by local
  Coordinators, who either runs operations in a geographical area
  or of a certain type (like fundamentalist Christianity or Left
  Wing politics). Above these Coordinators are the members of the
  Coordinator Council, who organise the large scale planning and
  develop general policies. It is led by the Chief Coordinator,
  currently the Euthanatos Georgios Papadimitriou.
     </br>
    </br>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p class="c6">
    <span class="c5">
     Resources:
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    The Horsemen have access to huge mundane resources. Most mages
  can easily build a great base of power and wealth, but the
  Horsemen has been working on it for decades. However, their
  magickal resources are not as strong, since they prefer to use
  mundane methods.
   </p>
   <p>
    Economically, the Horsemen control several apparently
  unrelated financial empires, with ties into almost every part of
  the world and every trade. Their influence is mostly passive, and
  they only intervene to make sure their assets grow and prosper.
  However, they have arranged things so that when the Millennium
  comes, the empires will all collapse in the worst possible way.
  They have also designed them to fall if the Coordinators vanish,
  to make sure at least the possibility of apocalypse remains if
  the Horsemen would be destroyed.
   </p>
   <p>
    The intelligence networks of the Horsemen are almost
  unrivalled, except by the Technocracy. Their agents are
  everywhere, and practically none know their real purpose. Many
  are simply normal people who think they help out some patriotic
  organisation or government group. Others are professional agents
  who think they work for some secret branch of some intelligence
  agency. A few are defectors from intelligence agencies who know
  they are working for some kind of conspiracy (they have often
  been misinformed to get a very erroneous image of what type of
  conspiracy it is. Many think they serve the Technocracy). And
  many are simply unwitting victims of deep hypnotic suggestions
  and mind control. Beside these agents, the Horsemen has lots of
  contacts and allies in every area, ranging from fundamentalist
  churches to the military-industrial complex.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Horsemen has also worked on acquiring as much surplus
  weapons from the fallen East Bloc they can, and stockpiling them
  in secret caches around the world. They have nuclear weapons,
  biological and chemical weapons, lots of firearms and a few
  heavier weapons. They intend to give them to terrorists,
  extremists and criminals just before the Millennium, to ensure
  maximum random destruction. Before that stage, they seek to limit
  such spread to create maximum effect when the bombings start.
   </p>
   <p>
    Magickally they are not very strong. They control a few nodes
  and have a Horizon Realm, but not much more. This is a conscious
  policy to avoid arousing the suspicion of the Traditions and
  Technocracy. The realm, mostly known as Command, is a captured
  small NWO construct. A group of tradition mages captured it
  during the 60ps, and it got into the hands of the Horsemen. They
  have not changed it very much. Its central part is the War Room,
  a meeting room with great screens and maps showing current world
  situation, where the Council of Coordinators meet. Around it are
  a complex of offices, computer rooms, corridors, warehouses and
  small living units, not unlike the inside of some military
  installation. The realm is reachable through its elevators; a
  mage can simply step into an elevator, press a code on a panel
  and the elevator will rise to any floor in most buildings around
  the world. This doesnpt work the other way, somebody wanting to
  enter must signal it to the Construct, and they will send an
  elevator. Everything is clean, efficient and slightly
  technocratic. Most members find it very oppressive, but its also
  the only safe place for the Horsemen and the Central Coordinator
  actually lives here.

      The Coordinator Council:
      <br>
       <br/>
      </br>
     </span>
     Central Coordinator Georgios Papadimitriou
    </b>
    <br>
     <br>
      Georgios is the Central Coordinator of the Horsemen. He is an ex-
  member of the Euthanatos, who he voluntarily left to work totally
  for the Horsemen. Using his Entropy and Mind, he has erased the
  memory of himself from everybody except his closest associates,
  and nobody knows anything about his earlier history.
     </br>
    </br>
   </p>
   <p>
    Georgios is a middle aged man with dark hair and eyes. He
  always dresses impeccably in dark suits, and always seems to sit
  in a pool of shadow. He is polite, quiet and seems to spend most
  of his time just studying people with his unsettling gaze. He
  never seems to get angry or have any other strong emotion except
  for determination.
   </p>
   <p>
    He is actually not completely happy with the current
  situation. While he thrills at the thought of attempting to give
  the Technocracy and Modern Civilisation the Good Death, he also
  longs for personal involvement. Manipulating the destiny of
  mankind is not as rewarding and merciful as actually help people
  as individuals, like the rest of his tradition does. He actually
  longs to join it again, but feels that he is more needed here.
  However, he sometimes takes a walk through the city, just to feel
  the presence of normal people, to share a bit of their lives and
  deaths.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p class="c6">
    Military Coordinator Laura Peterson
   </p>
   <p>
    If Georgios is darkness and death, Laura is fire and blood.
  Shortly after her initiation into the Verbena she witnessed how
  the Technocracy destroyed her whole coven with a chemical
  "accident". After that she wowed to destroy the Technocracy and
  all of the decadent, sick, modern civilisation.
   </p>
   <p>
    She is a red-haired woman in her late forties, with an
  impressive build and an iron-will. She is outdoors as much as
  possible, and always wear practical, rugged clothing. She is
  currently involved in the survivalist movement, and actually runs
  a secret survivalist camp with strong ties to the Verbena. Her
  main area as Coordinator is contacts with the Traditions and
  Military. She is the secret face of the Horsemen to the
  traditions, where she is known as a very radical mage, often
  inciting other mages to strike harder at the Technocracy or
  modern society. She is the center of a network of similar-minded
  mages in the Traditions, from whom she sometimes recruits new
  members to the Horsemen.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her connections with the military are indirect, through her
  staff of subordinate Coordinators. They are all highly competent
  and fairly independent, and her main task is just to coordinate
  them. She dislikes just developing strategic planning, which she
  often leaves to Dr Hill. She wants to get personally involved,
  and thus has taken as her personal responsibility to organise
  para-military groups around the world.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p class="c6">
    Economical Coordinator Charles Liddenbrook
  (Flood-which-sweeps-the-plain)
   </p>
   <p>
    Despite his name, Charles is a full-blooded Indian. He grew up
  without acknowledging his heritage, trying to fit in with the
  white man by turning his considerable intelligence and willpower
  into a business career. When he was called by the spirits, he
  refused until they forced his eyes open to see what had been done
  to his people, the world and to the spirits. Then he swore
  vengeance, took his new name and joined the fight against the
  Technocracy. He soon proved his worth to the Horsemen, and became
  one of the youngest Coordinators ever. He is currently
  responsible for the financial side of the organisation, pulling
  the strings to the different financial empires.
   </p>
   <p>
    Charles appears to have two personalities, one of a cunning
  and hyper-efficient businessman always clad in conservative
  suits, one of a raging shaman invoking great spirits of
  destruction against the oppressing white man. His talent for
  financial destruction is great, and Georgios is very confident
  that he will be able to bring the world economy crashing down
  when the time is right. However, Charles disagrees with the two
  others about how to deal with the Traditions. He wants to warn at
  least some mages about the Millennium in order to give them a
  better chance to survive the cataclysm. The others want to keep
  it a total secret for security reasons.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p class="c6">
    Strategic Coordinator Dr. Alexander Hill
   </p>
   <p>
    Dr. Hill is a small, bespectacled man with sparse grey hair, a
  hunched posture and a freckled, wrinkled face. He is the oldest
  of the Coordinators, and have been with the Horsemen since the
  early Cold War (in fact, he was one of the founders of the modern
  group). He is the resident expert on all forms of nuclear
  weapons, chemical weapons and especially bioweapons.
   </p>
   <p>
    He is one of the few Sons of Ether involved in the Horsemen.
  He started as a military analyst during the 40's, and with his
  keen mind and ruthless efficiency gained widespread recognition.
  That he was serving the Technocracy didn't bother him the least.
  Then one day he made a simple extrapolation of current research
  and politics, and he was horrified. He suddenly realised how the
  Technocracy would trap mankind in eternal stasis with no way out,
  and worse, they had all but succeeded. He joined the Horsemen,
  and remained inside the defence sphere as a valuable agent until
  the late 50's, when he left and became Coordinator.
   </p>
   <p>
    Dr. Hill is the Coordinator responsible for terrorism and
  intelligence. He runs his intelligence networks with ruthless
  efficiency through his underlings. While he often falls back into
  classical Cold War rhetoric against the Technocracy, he is always
  coldly planning for all eventualities and developing new ways to
  make the Millennium as devastating as possible. It was his idea
  to acquire as much Soviet military material as possible, and he
  has even made some slight improvements in the bioweapons-field.
  He is genuinely interested in seeing how they will work out.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p class="c6">
    <span class="c7">
     Story Ideas:
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    The characters might be approached by agents from the Horsemen
  if they appear to fight the Technocracy hard enough. At first the
  agents may pose as members of a radical cabal, and subtly test
  the characters to see how far they are prepared to go in the
  fight. When they have truly proven themselves (and preferable are
  too deep in the war to back out), they might be offered to join
  the Horsemen.
   </p>
   <p>
    The players by chance stumbles upon some old technocracy
  documents which imply that some external force tried to worsen
  World War I in many ways. The Horsemen might become worried if
  somebody starts to dig in their past, and send out their agents
  to lead the characters astray or remove them, posing as the
  Technocracy.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the player characters are members of the Technocracy, they
  might start to notice that there is some other force influencing
  things subtly. When they start to dig, they might find disturbing
  correlations between some old files from the Cold War, current
  economics and a slow rise in societal tensions.
   </p>
   <p>
    Everywhere in the World of Darkness there are whispers of an
  imminent disaster; vampires dream daymares about Gehenna,
  werewolf shamans see frightful visions they do not dare to tell
  anybody, the wraiths grow uneasy and mages feel a building
  tension in the tapestry. The Horsemen are working towards the
  Millennium, unknowingly serving greater forces which slowly bring
  the world towards the brink of destruction - or Ascension?
