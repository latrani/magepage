   "Sammy"

  <p>
   Background: Sammy was born in 1982. His mothered abandoned him
  at age 4. He went out onto the streets of New York, and soon
  noticed something odd. Some of the stars seemed to move, and
  others didn't. Perhaps they weren't stars at all. For Sammy was a
  certifiable genius. In a week, he had deduced the laws of motion
  and the inverse square law. By age five he had figured out
  Mendelian genetics, the valence shell electron pair repulsion
  model of the atom, and general relativity. By age six, he had
  deduced the existence of the uncertainty principle, the superego,
  space-time curvature and pretty much everything else known to
  modern science. All without any schooling at all. He couldn't
  even read. At age eight, he chanced upon a battle between a
  Akashic Brother and a HIT Mark. He gave some thought to it, did
  some spying, and in a week had deduced the existence of the
  Ascension War, as well as all the factions involved. The next
  day, he walked up to the nearest Void Engineer base, and asked to
  be made a member.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, he just couldn't deal with it. All of the
  Technocracy's theories were
   <i>
    wrong
   </i>
   . Couldn't they tell? The
  same was true of the Traditions. Pretty soon, the Oracles noticed
  him. Sammy was too polite to tell that Oracles how wrong
   <i>
    they
   </i>
   were.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now, at age 14, no one can decide what to do with him. The
  Oracles find him an extreme embarassment, as it is hard to accept
  that a sleeper knows more about the universe than they do.
   <i>
    Everyone
   </i>
   wants him one their side, but Sammy exists in his
  own little world. No one knows his motivations, but he wanders
  around Earth and Umbra, to no apparent end.
  </p>
  <p>
   Appearance: A 14 year old, he is of medium height, medium
  weight, and has medium brown hair of medium length. The kind of
  huy you always miss in a crowd. Wherever, he goes, however,
  everyone notices
   <i>
    something
   </i>
   about him. This is a side
  effect of the Oracles who constantly accompany him, ready to
  protect him from all threats until they decide if they are going
  to kill him themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
   Roleplaying Hints: Sigh. Can't these people just take their
  own theories to their logical conclusions? They'd see how wrong
  they are, and then maybe they'd wise up. Awakened, schakened.
  You're not Awakened, but that hasn't kept you from gaining
  understanding. All the same, you have bigger fish to fry. The
  things beyond the Tellurian are waiting to come in, and only you
  can stop them.
  </p>
  <p>
   Note: Sammy is not a combatant, so no stats are needed for
  him. However, his Oracular protectors make him effectively
  invulnerable. He is obsessed with destroying the Outsiders, and
  all his actions are calculated to this end. He may ask the
  characters for help, give them strange bits of advice, or
  anything else. A great way to get a campaign with the Outsiders
  going.
