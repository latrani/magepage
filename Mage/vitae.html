  <h1>
   Regarding the Nature of Vampiric Vitae
  </h1>
  <i>
   By Frater IAM,
  Magister Templii of Ordo Rosae Crucis Vienna.

  <p>
   Currently much debate rage among our collegues of the former
  house of Tremere regarding the true nature of vampirism and its
  causes. This may seem ironic, due to their first-hand information
  on the subject, but may also be seen as a sign of an unfortunate
  decline in scholarship and magickal knowledge among our esteemed
  colleagues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Our study team has examined the traditions regarding vampirism
  and its effects, and cross-correlated this with our own
  information, samples from vampiric beings and some discussions
  with our undead colleagues. We can now present our findings:
  </p>
  <p>
   The most important aspect of vampiric existence is the blood,
  the Vitae. In the following discussion, we will use the term
  "blood" to denote the bodily fluids of mammalian creatures, and
  "vitae" to denote the fluids infusing the undead bodies of the
  vampires. As is well known, vampires needs a steady supply of
  blood to survive. They can reproduce by draining the blood of a
  human and replacing a small part of it by vitae, which will
  result in the transformation of the body to an undead state. They
  can also strongly influence mortals by giving them small amounts
  of vitae over a long time, and bind mortal (and vampires) to
  themselves by making them dependent on their blood (so called
  "ghouls" and "thralls" respectively).
  </p>
  <p>
   Its immediately clear to anybody who studies a vampire from a
  hermetic standpoint that they are composite creatures, consisting
  of a dead body animated by some animating principle. This
  principle seems to be the vitae. Analysis has revealed a very
  high Quintessence content, not unlike Tass, in a material basis
  quite similar to normal blood. In fact, vitae is not as much a
  substance as a parasitic being, using the undead body for
  protection and to influence the material world. Left on its own,
  vitae is rather inert although it will not decay normally and
  retains its unusual properties for a long time. It is quite
  sensitive to sunlight and fire, which destroys it (possibly due
  to the existence of a strong flow of radical quintessence).
  </p>
  <p>
   But when it enters a dead body, it will infuse its tissues,
  transform the dead flesh into a more stable form which does not
  decay normally (vitae seems to be a natural preserving fluid) and
  can animate almost as in its living state. Another, more subtle
  effect is the reanimation of the nervous system, or more exactly
  the resident spirit (as opposed to the Anima, life force, and the
  Avatar, the divine aspect, which has already left the dead body).
  Apparently the vitae reanimates the spirit of the body, restoring
  it to full or near-full function. It will retain all memories,
  personality traits, skills and similar traits, but will lack the
  true Avatar, the soul, making it unable to use magick or reach
  salvation. In place of the Anima the Vitae takes its place as
  animating agent.
  </p>
  <p>
   The goals of the Vitae are simple, as one can expect from such
  a simple spiritual organism: survival and spread. To resupply
  necessary nutrients and more importantly Quintessence, the vitae
  has to convert blood into vitae. The process is mainly spiritual
  in character, and is enforced by filling the vampire with intense
  feelings of hunger. It seems that the consciousness of the vitae
  completely lack anything higher than instinctual responses, and
  has to rely on the rational intellect of the host for planning
  and practical matters. It influences the host by creating
  intense, primal emotions linked to itself. This also explains the
  extreme fear of sunlight and fire most vampires feel, as their
  vitae recognizes a dangerous threat. Due to the atavistic nature
  of the vitae, it will also activate many of the more primal
  layers of consciousness, causing the phenomenon known as "the
  Beast", an amalgam of normal human subconscious desires combined
  with the influence of the vitae.
  </p>
  <p>
   Note that the quintessence of vitae gives the vampires the
  ability to mimic true (or hedge) magickal effects. This has been
  developed to a great extent by the former house of Tremere, in
  lieu of the ability to create true magick. Other effects seems to
  be quite tied to the vitae, like extreme strength or resilence,
  mental powers and other supernatural effects. All are tied into
  the magickal nature of the vitae, and can be controlled from a
  conscious level by the vampire with some training.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ghouls are an interesting phenomenon. Apparently the vitae is
  much a kind of spiritual infection, and can be repulsed by the
  normal astral immune system of normal people. A person ingesting
  vitae will become influence by it, becoming slightly modified by
  is tissue-transforming effects and more irritable due to "The
  Beast". But the effects will not last long, as the living pattern
  and the protective presence of the Holy Guardian Angel will
  destroy the vitae in the system.
  </p>
  <p>
   Blood bonding is the final problem in this model. Apparently,
  vitae is highly addictive (which is reasonable, due to its high
  quintessence content). An individual drinking vitae from a
  certain vampire (each vampire seems to have his own unique type)
  will become profoundly psychologically addicted to the person,
  perhaps through the interaction between the two types of vitae.
  One theory claims that the normal blood-converting processes will
  work extremely well on the vitae, causing the "Beast" to search
  for more similar vitae. This spreads upwards through the
  subconscious, creating an effect not unlike falling in love.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another result of the profound addictivity of vitae is
  so-called diablerie. This consist of one vampire draining another
  until the other suffers final death (when all vitae is gone, the
  tissue and spirit animating principle ends). In this process the
  diablerist seems to gain power from the victim. This is of course
  easy to explain. Normally ingested vitae in a vampiric body is
  re-integrated into the vitae of the body, not unlike how a living
  body converts vitae to normal blood. But large amounts of vitae,
  especially the vitae saturated with the animating principle which
  result from extreme distress (it seems that in certain situations
  the vitae normally bound to the tissues leave them, maybe as a
  protective response), can overwhelm this system and cause a
  merging or "take-over" of vitae. In essence, the vitae of the
  victim replaces the vitae of the diablerist. Since the spirit of
  the diablerist is not influenced, individual identity is not
  lost.
