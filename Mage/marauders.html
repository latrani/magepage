   How do marauders see magick? And why don't they suffer from
  Paradox? Here are some theories:
   <p>
    Marauders see the world slightly differently from normal
  mages. Normal mages tend to view it in self-consistent way,
  mainly based on their Traditions and personal experiences. Things
  happen for a reason, and although it sometimes can be hard to
  find the true causes, they exist somewhere. A mage can manipulate
  reality and get predictable changes in response, as long as the
  mage performs his magick correctly. Marauders doesn't agree. They
  don't demand that reality should make any sense or behave in any
  predictable pattern. It is meaningless to speculate on why
  something happens, although there are sometimes apparent
  explanations. A marauder wills changes into reality, which may or
  may not respond as the marauder wants. Sometimes the result is
  completely different, sometimes it's more useful than the effect
  the mage had originally intended.
   </p>
   <p>
    This alternative way of seeing things makes marauders very
  different from normal mages. First, their perspective makes them
  appear completely insane to everybody. All normal humans
  (including mages) presuppose that things should make at least
  some sense, not just behave as they want. If a rock would start
  to fly, it must have been caused by something (like an act of
  magick). A marauder just accepts the fact.
   </p>
   <p>
    Since marauders bend reality just like ordinary mages, their
  acceptance gives things in reality much greater freedom than
  usual, and rocks may start to fly in the vicinity of a powerful
  marauder just for the fun of it. These random effects are not
  very controllable, but tends to reflect the current way the
  marauder sees things. If a marauder is angry, violent effects
  will appear (windows breaking, nasty insects appearing and things
  catching fire), and if the marauder is happy, entertaining
  effects will tend to appear (voices sounding funny, inanimate
  objects moving and unusual people appearing). These are actually
  the same type of subconscious effects which surround many mages,
  albeit much stronger and vulgar. Hermetic mages tend to cause
  hermetic coincidences around them, Trenchcoaters spread their
  gloom with them and everything becomes rational and efficient
  around technomancers.
   </p>
   <p>
    The most famous power of the marauders is their reputed
  immunity to paradox. This is in fact not true. Marauders suffers
  as much Paradox as normal mages, but the main difference is how
  they deal with it. Normal mages fear it, and try to control it.
  Marauders just accept it as a way of life and doesn't care what
  form it takes. Illogical events are just a way of life for them,
  so the occasional paradox flaw or backlash isn't that unusual.
  This acceptance paradoxically makes marauders much safer from
  Paradox. Most of the time, the Paradox will not hurt the
  marauder, it will ground in the surroundings causing even more
  odd changes. When it attacks the marauder, it will not really
  hurt him, just warp him even more. Marauders doesn't try to
  distinguish Quiet and Paradox Realms from normal "reality", they
  deal with Paradox Spirits just as if they were normal spirits.
  Occasional backlashes are a part of life, and can be enjoyed. In
  fact, many marauders are "paradox-junkies", attracting out great
  amounts of paradox and then releasing it just to see what
  happens.
   </p>
   <p>
    Another effect of the marauder mentality is that the Spheres
  doesn't work in a normal way. The effects which appear often
  doesn't match the effects the mage intended (marauders doesn't
  expect them to). They often have about the same result, and
  frequently do things in very warped ways. This seems to be
  dependent on how deep into Quiet the marauder is, as a general
  rule the effects become more weird the more paradox he has
  accumulated. A marauder deep into Quiet who creates a lightening
  strike against somebody may create a swarm of rainbow colored
  confetti, which strikes the target and kills him.
   </p>
   <p>
    Marauder countermagick also works differently from normal.
  Marauders doesn't resist magick like most mages do, they seek to
  warp it before it hits them. Their countermagick, if it succeeds,
  will simply turn the effect into something else (at least
  partially). If a mage attacks a marauder with a electric attack,
  the marauder might respond with countermagick using Life. If the
  marauder succeeds, the electric discharge manifests as a pigeon.
  A partial success will create something in between, like a
  coruscating pigeon striking the marauder.

   <h2>
    <a name="ROTES">
     Marauder Rotes (a contradiction in terms, I
  know...):
    </a>
   </h2>
   <b>
    Anti-Reality (Prime 4):
   </b>
   This is
  essentially the exact opposite of anti-magick (see BoS for
  details). The marauder dissolves the supporting threads of the
  local Tapestry, allowing reality to flow more freely and adding
  excess quintessence to it. This creates a local region of dynamic
  reality, where the normal laws are temporarily suspended. A kind
  of anti-paradox zone, where vulgar magick may become
  coincidental. However, the rote itself is
   <em>
    very
   </em>
   vulgar.
  It will attract Paradox Spirits as honey attracts bees. But if
  the spirits enter the area, they become influenced by the local
  paradigm and may begin to behave in unexpected ways. In fact,
  they might start defending the
   <em>
    local
   </em>
   rules instead for a
  short time, in opposition to their unchanged brethren. Very
  confusing.
   <p>
    Another side-effect is that the dynamic reality and free
  quintessence makes random events occur. This ranges from weak
  effects like having a glass coincidentally break or insects
  behaving strangely when the rote hasn't turned reality very
  dynamic, over more dramatic effects like potential fire becoming
  real or spirits manifesting to truly bizarre and dangerous events
  like objects changing shape, breaches of the Gauntlet and reality
  behaving like a surrealist painting.
   </p>
   <p>
    [Each success will make vulgar effects of less or equal levels
  coincidental. For example, with 3 successes all magick up to
  level 3 in any sphere is coincidental, while Life 4 would still
  be vulgar. It will also allow random effects up to this level,
  but they are completely uncontrollable.]
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Domino Fall (Entropy 3 Prime 2):
    </b>
    The marauder draws
  more randomness and weirdness into the local area, empowering
  them. Unlikely things start to happen, people get straight
  flushes all the time, long lost relatives pay visits, bullets
  ricochet along truly absurd trajectories and so on. This doesn't
  necessarily cause any vulgar effects at first, but quite soon the
  number of improbabilities builds up, and the domino effect causes
  a massive backlash.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Call Forth the Forgotten (Life 5, Prime 2, Spirit 2):
    </b>
    see
    <em>
     Book of Shadows
    </em>
    , page 147. Summons a mythical
  being.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Transformation Rotes (Prime 4, Sphere 1, Sphere 2/3/5):
    </b>
    Marauders excel in changing the forms of things, just to
  demonstrate the possibilities. This is both highly vulgar and
  entertaining. The marauder simply dissolves the pattern of
  something old and creates a new pattern for it, while keeping the
  essence unchanged. This works mainly on the pattern spheres, but
  enterprising marauders have experimented with turning people into
  patterns of randomness or spatial relationships.
   </p>
   <p>
    The new pattern will still retain the essence of its previous
  form. Radioactivity turned into Life will appear as scorpions,
  air turned into life will become birds or butterflies. Gravity
  turned into matter will become lead, while Gravity turned into
  life will become an Elephant or something heavy. And so on.
   </p>
   <p>
    [To transform a pattern of one type to another, the marauder
  must perceive it (using level 1 of the sphere), take it apart
  using Prime 4 and rebuild it using Prime 2 and the new
  pattern-sphere (Matter 2/4, Life 3, Forces 3/5). The number of
  successes will tell how well the transformation went and how
  stable the new pattern is. Most changed patterns don't survive
  very well.]
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Summon Being of Change (Spirit 2):
    </b>
    This rote summons
  one type of spirit, known just as the Beings of Change. They
  don't have any visible appearance, but can be seen due to their
  effects. The Beings are roughly shaped like thin surfaces, which
  sweep through matter as if it wasn't there. As they pass through
  things, they change them. Weak beings just change small things
  like orientation and placement, like making things appear in
  other places or turned upside down. More powerful beings change
  inanimate objects into new objects, like turning rocks into piles
  of paper or pencils into glasses of whiskey. After that, the
  beings can start to change living beings slightly, or add new
  things. Ants turn into butterflies, electronic components appear.
  Very powerful beings can twist living and dead things into new
  shapes, add new beings or truly bizarre dead matter. The most
  powerful beings twist not only the body, but the mind. They can
  change personalities and appearances, create completely unreal
  things and erase things with equal ease.
   </p>
   <p>
    [Each success will summon a more powerful being, or several
  smaller ones. The number denotes the level of spheres the beings
  can emulate. However, they cannot change the amount of
  quintessence in reality, just what structures it is tied into. To
  create something, something else have to go. The beings will not
  last very long, since paradox quickly dissolves them. However,
  they are not influenced by any form of Prime or Pattern magick,
  which they simply transform into another form.]
