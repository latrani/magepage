   <h2>
    Summoning and Employment of Spirits
   </h2>
   <h3>
    New Skills:
   </h3>
   <b>
    Savoir-Faire (Umbrood) M/H
   </b>
   <br>
    <b>
     Defaults to Spirit Lore-4
    </b>
    <br>
     Umbrood often have very alien minds, and correspondingly arcane
  social practices. Gaining their aid or service is helped by
  knowing how to address them with appropriate respect and
  negotiate properly.
     <p>
      <b>
       Spirit Lore M/H
      </b>
      <br>
       <b>
        Defaults to Spirit Sphere skill-2 or Occultism-4
       </b>
       <br>
        The study of spirits, their summoning and behavior, including
  True Names. A roll on Spirit Lore can add successes to a
  summoning. The GM should only allow experience points gained in
  direct study of texts or real experience to be invested in this
  skill.
       </br>
      </br>
     </p>
     <p>
      Mages may also develop Reputations among spirits. This can
  help in gaining a spirit's cooperation or service, or negotiating
  the Guerdon down to something more reasonable. A court, pantheon
  or general cultural mythos counts as a large group. A specific
  type of spirits (elementals, domoviks) counts as a small group. A
  mage who is a demon queller or exorcist may possess a positive
  reputation that is only useful when fighting or intimidating
  spirits. Charisma usually helps with spirits, but Appearance
  seldom does.
     </p>
     <h2>
      The Summoning of Spirits
     </h2>
     An ever present concern when
  summoning beings from the umbra is the possibility of summoning
  the Nephandi by accident or even intention. All traditions are
  very cautious about the spirit lore they pass on to their
  students. There are large texts cataloguing various types of
  spirits, and carefully developed procedures for containing and
  dispelling hostile entities. Most Disciples of Spirit only know a
  small fraction of their tradition's total knowledge of Umbrood,
  limited to safe and cooperative entities that are open to
  negotiation. The Order of Hermes and Akashic Brotherhood maintain
  large indexes of Umbrood, and Dreamspeakers and Verbena are
  taught lengthy oral records. The Celestial Chorus is the
  strongest opponent to summoning servitors, and with rare
  exceptions never summon spirits themselves.
     <p>
      The greatest problem is that of temptation. Telling students
  of the existence of powerful, malevolent beings, despite all the
  cautions added to the lessons, may spur them to attempt study of
  said beings and risk accidentally summoning them. However, if
  students are not told of the hostile beings, they may stumble
  across them by accident and be unaware of their danger. Hollow
  Ones, having no accumulated lore like other traditions, are the
  most at risk of opening Pandora's Box.
     </p>
     <p>
      When discussing Umbrood, it is important to realize that any
  listing of spirit beings is merely one taxonomy. The same being
  may be known by different names in different cultures and times,
  ie. the being known as Athena of the Ancient Greeks manifested to
  the Vikings as Sif and as Draupadi to the Hindus. Alternately,
  some Umbrood may take the guise of a mythic figure from another
  culture. For example, if appearing as the Virgin Mary will make a
  manifestation of the Celestine Gaia more acceptable to the
  Sleepers, Gaia will do so. Keep in mind that many spirits seem to
  be incapable of blatant lies, but this does not stop them from
  letting sleepers jump to the wrong conclusions.
     </p>
     <h2>
      Guerdon
     </h2>
     There's no such thing as a free lunch, and that's
  just as true in the Umbra. Gaining an Umbrood's aid always costs
  something, be it time, effort, Quintessence, blood, favours in
  return or even money (in a few cases); this is known as Guerdon.
  A few spirits will assist mages without any reward, but these
  almost always have ulterior (and malevolent) motives. A very few
  will aid a summoner for nothing but only if the summoner displays
  some extraordinary character trait in keeping with the spirit's
  general orientation.
     <p>
      The most common forms of Guerdon:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Payment:
      </b>
      Many spirits seem to derive sustenance and/or
  pleasure from absorbing offered Quintessence. Some will accept
  any form of raw Quintessence or Tass. (Prime 2, Spirit 2)
     </p>
     <p>
      Others insist upon having certain Patterns converted into
  Quintessence; the summoner must obtain a specific life form,
  substance, object or energy to satisfy the entity. Note that
  these offerings cannot be created by the use of Life, Matter or
  Forces; they must be naturally occurring items. Generally, the
  more powerful the spirit, the rarer the desired item will be.
  (Spirit 3, Prime 3)
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Challenge:
      </b>
      The summoner must win a contest of some
  kind. This may be anything from actual physical combat to
  Certamen to a riddle contest. Others arrange cunning tests of the
  summoner's moral character.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Favours:
      </b>
      The spirit performs its service in the
  understanding that the summoner will perform a service in return
  in the future. Some creatures even include a signed written
  contract, and may even demand blood oaths, first born children or
  the like. Darker beings have demanded prices so terrible that the
  only worse fates are those which befall mages who have tried to
  welch out on their deals.
     </p>
     <h2>
      Servitors
     </h2>
     Disciples of Spirit are taught the summonings
  of a general class of Umbrood that may be easily employed by
  mages, distinguished by having useful abilities and amenable
  natures, referred to as servitors. They are fairly easily
  summoned, and negotiation is seldom necessary. The price is fair
  and they don't haggle.
     <h3>
      Common Servitors
     </h3>
     <b>
      Paracelsian Elementals:
     </b>
     A class
  of Umbrood that are often summoned by Hermetics and Etherians.
  They are reliable and cooperative for the most part, so long as
  they are properly rewarded with Quintessence.
     <p>
      <b>
       Sylphs:
      </b>
      Air spirits, resembling wispy smoke in the
  shape of birds or serpents. Sylphs are often flighty and easily
  distracted, and are adept scouts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Nymphs:
      </b>
      Water elementals resembling humanoid globs of
  fluids. Their behavior is the most variable.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Gnomes:
      </b>
      (Not to be confused with Faerie gnomes) Earth
  elementals, and resemble humanoids of soil or stone. They are
  often inflexible and dogmatic in obeying their orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Salamanders:
      </b>
      Fire elementals. Short tempered and
  violent, they serve best as soldiers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Virtual Adepts and Sons of the Ether have also employed
  elementals of glass, metal, plastic, electricity and even
  information (though the latter may actually be daimons (qv.))
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Summon Elemental: Spirit 2, Matter/Forces/Mind 2
      </b>
      <br>
       <b>
        Sample Elemental: "Mudhoney"
       </b>
       <br>
        An earth elemental employed by a cabal of Verbena and
  Dreamspeakers to guard their Louisiana bayou Node, Mudhoney
  manifests as a quadrupedal lump of mud, vines and algae.
  Intruders in the Node, deliberate or accidental, will find their
  way blocked by bogs, thickets of vines, swamp gas pockets and
  other hazards of the environment.
       </br>
      </br>
     </p>
     <p>
      Mudhoney's Guerdon is live music, preferably acoustic blues
  guitar. It is satisfied with an hour of play each week, during
  which it manifests and does a peculiar kind of dancing.
     </p>
     <h2>
      Golems
     </h2>
     A servitor similar to elementals in many respects.
  However, they cannot manifest by themselves, and require the mage
  to create a body for it to inhabit. Golems are more reliable than
  elementals but less intelligent and independent. They are seldom
  capable of understanding commands more complex than "Pick this
  up, stack it over there and come back," or "Grab anyone who tries
  to enter this room except members of the cabal." They are usually
  incapable of speech.
     <p>
      A golem body may be constructed out of almost anything, from
  paper to armor alloy. Hermetics use sculpted forms, while
  Etherians build clockwork or electrical automatons. A rule of
  thumb is that the more labor invested in the construction of the
  vessel, the easier it is to have a servitor inhabit it. Also, the
  summoner must be intimately involved in the construction of the
  vessel.
     </p>
     <p>
      A golem need not be shaped like a human or animal. A popular
  choice is a car.
     </p>
     <p>
      Craft Golem: Spirit 2 Matter 4. The vessel may require Craft
  or Technical skills for its construction.
     </p>
     <h2>
      Daimons
     </h2>
     Spirits who provide primarily intellectual
  advice. They are often cryptic, and may be malevolent or
  benevolent, or motivated solely by intellectual challenge. Some
  are autistic-savant-like calculators or stores of information.
  They seldom, if ever, manifest as actual beings, but may
  communicate through visions, reflections in water, online
  databases or anonymous phone calls.
     <p>
      These are not to be confused with the Avatar, which some
  traditions refer to as the daimon. Some Choristers also refer to
  them as angels or demons. A daimon who has a lasting relation
  with a mage may qualify as a Contact.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Summon Daimon: Spirit 2, Mind 1
      </b>
      <br>
       <b>
        Sample Daimon: The Operator
       </b>
       <br>
        This being, known to Hollow Ones and Virtual Adepts, has the
  peculiar ability of finding people and organizations. It
  manifests through telephones as a nasal, irritating voice, with
  an unpleasant disposition. The summoner asks the Operator where a
  given person or group is, and the Operator tells him. The answer
  may be a mailing address, latitude and longitude coordinates, or
  some arcane system of Umbragraphy if the target is outside the
  Realm. The Operator will provide absolutely no other information,
  and will get very belligerent if asked to do so. Its Guerdon is a
  pure silver coin of any nationality or denomination.
       </br>
      </br>
     </p>
     <h2>
      Incubi/Succubi
     </h2>
     Most of these creatures are servants in
  the employ of Nephandi. More than a few mages in search of
  pleasure have fallen to malevolent beings. Among the Cult of
  Ecstasy, enjoying the favours of one of these beings and living
  to tell the tale is very prestigious. They tailor their
  appearances and behavior to be most attractive to their targets,
  and are actually both genderless and sexless. There are
  persistent stories of these beings developing real feelings and
  falling in love with their targets, but these are probably spread
  by them for their own ends.
     <p>
      <b>
       Summon Incubus/Succubus: Spirit 2, Mind 2/4 if the spirit
  is to be sent to a target other than the summoner.
      </b>
      <br>
       <b>
        Sample Succubus: The Girl in the Picture
       </b>
       <br>
        This Succubus first manifests to "her" target as an image on a
  billboard, magazine ad or TV commercial, which repeatedly appears
  to the (heterosexual) man selected. The target assumes this is
  just a coincidence, and begins to fantasize about the image,
  building up an character in his mind. The Girl in the Picture
  tailors its behavior and personality to match the target's
  imaginings. When enough information is gathered, the succubus
  manifests itself as a humanoid body and arranges a meeting. As
  the succubus closely matches his fantasy, there is little
  resistance. After enough time for the target to be truly
  infatuated, the succubus withdraws its affections, vanishes from
  the Realm and follows its target in the Umbra, from where it can
  draw its Guerdon, the emotional pain of rejection.
       </br>
      </br>
     </p>
     <h2>
      Zombies
     </h2>
     The most common servitor used by the Euthanatos,
  there appear to be several types of zombies.
     <p>
      Some are the bodies of dead humans which are used as the
  vessels of servitor spirits, mostly golems. [Spirit 2, Matter
  3]
     </p>
     <p>
      Others are corpses who retain a fragment of their former
  intellect, but the dead person is absent and has gone on to the
  afterlife. The Euthanatos claim that this makes no real
  difference to the departed person, and sometimes even perform
  this rote to honor those granted the Good Death. This rote must
  be performed at the moment of death. This type often has access
  to the memories of the former life, but a lack of free will.
  [Mind 4 Spirit 4]
     </p>
     <p>
      A third type is the deliberately created zombie, a person who
  is magickaly "lobotomized". The Avatar is separated and most free
  will and intelligence is likewise excised. The Euthanatos employ
  this technique as the harshest punishment for those who commit
  crimes against their Tradition, and as a reminder to others who
  would cross them. [Spirit 5 Life 4 Mind 4]
     </p>
     <h2>
      Domoviks
     </h2>
     Appearing in many cultures around the world,
  domoviks are household spirits. They inhabit a given area (seldom
  greater than a large house) along with a certain group of people
  and perform simple maintenance chores (dusting, washing dishes,
  sharpening pencils, backing up files). All this work occurs out
  of sight; the residents leave and come back to find the work is
  done. They have a lesser ability of providing minor security. If
  a person enters its domain who is not welcome, the domovik will
  mercilessly harass the intruder with "accidents", and alert its
  master if possible. If treated with respect and the occasional
  bit of Tass (no more than one pawn per year), domoviks are
  cooperative and helpful, but they can be mischievous and even
  vicious if offended, resulting in poltergeist-like phenomena.
  Domoviks almost never manifest visually, but can make their
  presence known. Many chantries keep domoviks for housekeeping and
  light security. Vandalism or destruction of a domovik's domain
  may cause it to go mad, resulting in a "haunted house."
     <p>
      <b>
       [Spirit 2 Matter 3]
      </b>
      <br>
       <b>
        Sample Domovik: File Manager
       </b>
       <br>
        A computer housekeeping system, File Manager indexes and backs up
  files and protects against voltage spikes, electric static and
  viruses. It also sends holiday messages.
       </br>
      </br>
     </p>
     <p>
      File Manger has one rather odd quirk; for some reason it
  objects to foul language. Use of profanity or obscenity will
  result in mild static shocks, light bulb burnouts, munched
  computer disks and other persistent nuisances. Text or graphics
  files of prurient interest will be lost. File Manager's Guerdon
  is to have copies of itself distributed as shareware and backup
  copies.
     </p>
     <h2>
      Maxwellian Demons
     </h2>
     A perennial favorite of the Sons of the
  Ether, these beings create small temporary zones with a paradigm
  tailored to a specific effect. In effect, they change one thing
  from impossible to possible. When this spirit is in effect,
  Vulgar effects with witnesses are treated as Vulgar without
  witnesses, Vulgar without witnesses becomes Coincidental, and
  Coincidental will never produce Paradox.
     <p>
      For the usefulness of these beings, they demand suspiciously
  little reward; perhaps they eat Paradox. They also invariably
  have very unpleasant personalities and will complain, insult,
  pester, and be stubborn. If attacked, they vanish instantly. It
  is speculated that Maxwellian Demons are an odd form of Paradox
  spirit, that acts preemptively.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Summon Maxwellian Demons: Spirit 2
      </b>
      <br>
       <b>
        Sample Maxwellian Demon: Abner
       </b>
       <br>
        A small monkey-like, leather-winged creature, Abner specializes
  in thermodynamic effects, such as creating systems that emit no
  waste heat.
       </br>
      </br>
     </p>
     <p>
      Abner freely insults his summoner and anybody else handy.
  However, these aren't run-of-the-mill insults. He has an uncanny
  ability to hit psychic nerves, sometimes even knowing obscure
  facts and guilty secrets about others. Its Guerdon is a live rat,
  which it eats in a rather disgusting fashion.
     </p>

      Notable Texts Concerning Spirits
     </h2>
     <b>
      Rota Fidus
  Spiritus:
     </b>
     One of the most comprehensive lists of beneficent
  spirits known to the Order of Hermes, contained in a series of
  handsome leather bound tomes with beautiful illustrations.
  Unfortunately, the entries date back to the Age of Myth, and are
  organized very poorly by modern standards. It is also written in
  a mixture of Latin and Hermean. The Rota focuses on elementals
  and daimons.
     <p>
      <b>
       Concordance of Self-Actuating Devices and Paranatural
  Intelligences (18th Edition):
      </b>
      Published by the Sons of the
  Ether and available to any subscriber of Paradigma, the
  Compendium offers a number of designs for golem vessels and the
  procedures for summoning many golems, daimons and Maxwellian
  demons. It comes in two wire bound editions. New editions come
  out ever five years or so. Chapbooks and monographs on other
  beings are circulated as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       ftp.virads.org /pub/AI/source/:
      </b>
      A large archive
  maintained by the Virtual Adepts and containing the source codes
  (summoning rituals) of many data elementals, daimons and
  domoviks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Song of True Names:
      </b>
      An oral record of helpful beings
  passed down from Dreamspeakers mentor to apprentice since time
  immemorial, primarily concerning elementals and naturae such as
  glade children and totems. It requires at least eight hours to
  recite entirely, and there are many alternate versions.
  Dreamspeakers pride themselves on treating Umbrood as respected
  equals and not as servants or tools, as they see other Traditions
  doing. Several transcriptions of this epic or parts of it have
  been made by scholars from other Traditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Records of the Celestial Bureaucracy:
      </b>
      A set of fifteen
  scrolls in Mandarin Chinese that provide descriptions and
  summonings of many Taoist and Confucian beings. These are often
  ancestor spirits, rather than non-human entities.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Lex Maleficus, also known as Project Black Book, the Real
  Necronomicon, the Hidden Song, Incarnations of the Black Mass and
  others:
      </b>
      This text is more myth than fact, an apocryphal
  collection of sketchy accounts of Nephandi, Umbrood Lords and
  Wyrm creatures of horrific power and malevolence, containing just
  enough information to piece together the summonings. According to
  the most common story, it is kept with other arcane books in a
  hidden cell in the Chantry of Doissetep and only the direct
  authority of the Council of Nine will allow anyone to see even
  one of its volumes. Some say the Lex Maleficus is a myth created
  by the Oracles as a red herring to distract mages searching for
  such knowledge.
