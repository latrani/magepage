   Iteration X Paradigm

   <h2>
    The Paradigm
   </h2>
   <b>
    The System
   </b>
   : The System encompasses
  everything that exists. The different parts and subsystems
  interact in complex ways, sometimes clashing or degrading in
  unpredictable ways which increases Entropy. Our duty is to
  redesign the System, remove inefficient or faulty parts and
  replace them with more appropriate systems according to the
  Program. In the end this will make the System both stable and
  optimal. No resources, no time and no energy will be wasted, and
  Ascension will occur.
   <h2>
    Magick
   </h2>
   <b>
    Design and Application
   </b>
   . The System can be
  modified by the design of new subsystems or the removal of old
  subsystems. This requires expertise and planning. It is often
  easier to change the System by introducing carefully designed
  subsystems (especially technology) which change it, than to try
  to change the System directly.
   <h2>
    Spheres

   <ul>
    <li>
     <b>
      Correspondence: Geometry
     </b>
     . By studying the proper use
    of space and distance, a unit can learn to use it optimally.
    Designs can be designed which conform better to the local
    geometry or take advantage of it and distances and shapes can
    be accurately analyzed. At higher levels the application of
    General Relativity allows manipulations of Space-Time on a
    macroscopic scale.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Entropy: Statistics
     </b>
     . Many processes in the System
    are so complex and chaotic they can only be described in a
    statistic form. Since any system will move to states of higher
    probability, which equals Entropy, statistics also deal (in the
    form of Thermodynamics) with the dynamics of Entropy and
    randomness. Statisticians are able to use their knowledge of
    such processes to influence them or even halt the increase of
    Entropy.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Forces: Physics
     </b>
     . Physicists study what effects
    applications of different types of energy has on systems, and
    how these can be employed in an optimal fashion. By using the
    tools of physics, all forms of energy can be studied,
    transformed into each other and modulated.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Life: Biology and Medicine
     </b>
     . Biology is the general
    science which deals with the structure and function of living
    beings, while Medicine studies the human anatomy in detail. The
    knowledge from these studies can then be used to modify these
    structures for various purposes (most notably
    biomechanics).
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Matter: Materials Science and Chemistry
     </b>
     . These
    sciences deal with the properties of different materials and
    chemicals, and how they can be changed. By designing a certain
    manufacturing method virtually any possible material or
    chemical can be produced.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Mind: Psychology
     </b>
     . Complex systems, most notably
    humans and Artificial Intelligences, exhibit complex internal
    states which process information. These states can be studied
    and modified with the proper application of psychology, which
    leads to subsequent changes in behavior.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Prime: Energy
     </b>
     . Everything in the System is composed
    of interacting structures of energy. In most cases these
    structures can be controlled and changed without having to deal
    with the underlying energy, but such operations tend to loose
    energy and increase Entropy. By controlling the energy
    directly, such inefficiencies can be removed.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Time: Special Relativity
     </b>
     . Causal processes can be
    simulated by applying statistics to the known laws of causal
    relations. By using the more advanced technologies of Special
    Relativity and Chronological Engineering the subjective or
    objective flow of time can be controlled.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h2>
    Arete
   </h2>
   <b>
    Expertise
   </b>
   . To be able to understand and
  apply the sciences, an unit must have the necessary expertise
  beforehand. This includes previous experiences, the correct
  education and the correct mental states to properly integrate
  knowledge with the current situation. First when all these
  factors are linked the unit will be able to design and apply his
  skills.
   <h2>
    Quintessence
   </h2>
   <b>
    Pure Energy
   </b>
   . Normally energy is bound
  in different forms of matter or energy (e.g. chemical energy,
  electromagnetic energy, thermic energy). It can however be
  transformed from these states into pure energy, or stored and
  transported as bound energy (which is safety-efficient). By
  activating a system with energy, it will become more active and
  productive.
   <h2>
    Paradox
   </h2>
   <b>
    Errors
   </b>
   . Errors occur when a design or an
  application did not fit properly in the system, causing a
  dissonance. Such errors must be immediately corrected before
  their unpredictable and often destructive effects spread. Often
  random side-effects occur, which has to be neutralized.
   <h2>
    Awakening
   </h2>
   <b>
    Initialization
   </b>
   . Before an unit can be
  employed in changing the System, it has to be initialized. This
  involves training and education in relevant skills and sciences,
  loyalty and ideological conditioning, and integration of the
  different mental subsystems into an efficient whole.
   <h2>
    Mage-specific Backgrounds
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <b>
      Arcane: Stealth
     </b>
     . To be able to change or study
    systems more efficiently and without causing undue
    disturbances, many units attempt to minimize their side-effects
    on systems.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Avatar: Mental Integration
     </b>
     . Certain units have
    greater grasp of how to apply the sciences or handle energy due
    to their particular neurological structure.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Destiny: Criticality
     </b>
     . Certain units have high
    significance for the Program, either due to their expertise or
    skills, or due to unknown factors decided by Autocthonia
    Central Core 0000.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Dream: Associative Abilities
     </b>
     . Some units exhibit
    above-average associative abilities, giving them greater
    flexibility at the expense of stability. Such units are
    carefully conditioned and used in data-processing.
