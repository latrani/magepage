   <h2>
    Sapphire and Steel:
   </h2>
   "All irregularities are to be handled
  by the forces controlling each dimension. Trans-Uranic heavy
  elements may not be used where there is life. Medium atomic
  weights are available; Gold, Lead, Copper, Jet, Diamond, Radium,
  Sapphire, Silver and Steel. Sapphire and Steel have been
  assigned" (opening credits)
   <p>
    Werewolves have often been described as the immune system of
  Gaia. However, they are not Gaia's only such expression. Another
  group which defends Gaia is the Elements.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Elements:
   </h2>
   Throughout the course of time, human beings
  have characterized the world as being mage up of various
  elements. These elements have a spiritual representation which in
  mythic times was represented by elementals (Fire, Earth, Air, and
  Water in the Western tradition). With the growing complexity of
  the models used to describe the components of the world, the
  spiritual manifestations have grown more complex as well. The
  modern forms of these elements are in many ways equal to mages.
  Because they are themselves are defined by consensual reality,
  such self-aware modern forms, known as Elements, serve to help
  define reality. They serve to protect Gaia, and consensual
  reality, from intrusions from beyond the Horizon. Some have
  argued that because the effect of these spirits is to protect
  static reality, they are a form of weaver spirit. In fact,
  because their true function is to protect Gaia from paranormal
  damage, the best description is that just as the Weres are the
  Wyld defenders of Gaia, Elements are the Weaver's defenders (with
  both springing from Gaia).
   <h2>
    Nature of Elements:
   </h2>
   Because Gaia and the Umbra are but
  reflections of each other, there is not a direct correspondence
  between the periodic table of the elements and the spiritual
  versions. Many elements (the spirits) survive from alchemical
  times (such as Sapphire), while others appear as the form more
  commonly thought of by people (Steel rather than Iron, Diamond
  rather than Carbon).
   <p>
    The home of the Elements lies in the gauntlet rather than in
  the Umbra. They are sensitive to breaches created in the gauntlet
  and will emerge to restore any breaks. As they are not true
  Umbrood, and never actually have to cross the gauntlet, the
  strength of the gauntlet in the vicinity does affect their
  materialization. Indeed, they are unable to manifest in areas
  where the strength of the gauntlet has been reduced to zero.
  Rather, they must emerge nearby, then travel to the site of the
  breach.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Aim of Elements is to stabilize reality: Sealing breaches
  in the gauntlet, neutralizing the source of the breach or
  otherwise stopping the weakening of static reality.
   </p>
   <p>
    One danger to mages is that Elements may mistake paradox flaws
  as disruptions to reality and seek to remove the disruption. This
  is only going to happen if the flaw (or the mage) is stationary.
  On the bright side, a paradox spirit operating within a very
  small area could also attract their attention.

     Essence:
    </b>
    Pattern. They reinforce static reality, what
  else do you expect?
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Appearance:
    </b>
    When manifested, elements appear as human,
  to avoid causing disruption. While in human form their appearance
  (and behavior) is related to the (physical) element on which they
  are based e.g. Steel appears as a man in a grey suit with a cold,
  rigid manner. When using magic their eyes, in which the pupil
  color relates to their basis, glow brightly with the color of
  their element.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Tactics:
    </b>
    Cause as little disruption to reality as
  possible. Avoid direct confrontation and don't use vulgar magic
  in front of witnesses. Contain, then seal off breaks in reality
  after first having gotten back anything (that was taken away)
  that will be missed and sending back anything that has come
  through (that will be noticed). Elements operate in groups of 2
  (or at most 3), each Element having complementary spheres and
  abilities. In dealing with any particular disruption, the other
  Elements will defer to the one with most relevant experience.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Attitude toward mages:
    </b>
    If they knew of us they would
  seek to interfere for their own ends. Avoid them, or if you
  cannot avoid them do not let them know what you are.
   </p>

    Stats:
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     These stats were produced before the Book of Madness came
  out, and even now I wouldn't change much because I find werewolf
  style powers too fiddly to keep track of when running
  Mage.
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    For those who want stats I suggest Attributes 7/6/4, Skills
  16/10/6, Background of Arcane 3. Arete 6. Willpower 8. Health
  Levels: Human + 1 extra O.K.
   </p>
   <p>

     Power: Manifestation
    </b>
    Elements can move freely in and
  out of the Gauntlet (Though prefer not to be observed when doing
  so). While in the Gauntlet (and in spirit form) they can travel
  very quickly, so often step into the Gauntlet to move from one
  physical location to another. Elements can look out from the
  Gauntlet to determine if they will be observed emerging.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Magic:
    </b>
    Mind 3 + 7 more points in spheres
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Foci:
    </b>
    None (-1 to Difficulty for Coincidental Magic, +1
  for vulgar w. witness)
   </p>
   <p>
    Elements are subject to paradox as per mages (in the final
  series of Sapphire and Steel they are trapped in a Correspondence
  Paradox realm for eternity).
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     A note on 'Heavy' Elements:
    </b>
    Heavy Elements (those
  relating to radioactive elements of the periodic table) are much
  more powerful than other Elements. Also, as befits their name,
  they are somewhat unstable (Dynamic Essence). Because they cannot
  be trusted to preserve static reality, they are only ever
  deployed outside of the Gauntlet to deal with powerful
  threats.
