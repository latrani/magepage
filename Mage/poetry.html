   Anton was a chemical engineer at a petrochemical plant until
  recently. He was not a very notable person, just another man in
  white coat and helmet busy checking the purity of certain
  compounds and living an unremarkable life. A serious accident
  happened when a large tank filled with partially refined oil
  became contaminated and exploded. Dozens of employees were killed
  or seriously injured, and a part of the plant collapsed into a
  raging inferno. Anton was nearly killed when a large pipe crashed
  down on him, trapping him inside the burning ruins. Almost by a
  miracle the fire-fighters managed to rescue him against all odds.
  He was in a coma for several weeks, badly hurt by the fumes and
  with severe burns. He was paralyzed from the waist down.
  Strangely, when he awoke he seemed not to be horrified with his
  state, but almost peaceful.
   <p>
    When Anton was trapped inside the raging inferno he had a
  vision. He saw the roaring flames, the boiling chemicals, the
  collapsing walls and the total destruction. In that moment he saw
  through all of them and saw what was behind it. He saw the Face
  of the Wyrm. And he fell in love. After leaving the hospital, he
  devoted himself to poetry to celebrate and worship the power he
  saw in his vision. Money was not a problem, since the company was
  forced to pay large amounts to survivors and next of kin in
  damages. Anton retired to his home, and started to write.
   </p>
   <p>
    Anton's poetry isn't terribly good. Most normal people would
  think it quite morbid, but also rather boring. Endless lists of
  accidents, sprinkled with chemical and medical terms and odd
  metaphors. The few publishers he showed his poetry to politely
  rejected him, but Anton didn't care. He writes because he likes
  it, not because he expects anybody else to understand. While
  normal people find it somewhat boring and not very avant-garde,
  other beings understand it far better. Shortly after his second
  attempt to get published, he had a visit from three persons.
  These persons disturbed him, but he also felt something else.
  Perhaps kinship. They demanded to hear his poetry, and were quite
  violent. Their reaction to his
    <em>
     Elegy to Dioxin
    </em>
    was
  astounding; they started to rave and pray to something they
  called "the Wyrm". After that, Anton got a regular audience.
  Strange visitors arrive to hear his poetry, and they seem to
  appreciate it greatly. Sometimes they tell him stories, which he
  weaves into his poetry.
   </p>
   <p>
    Anton is in fact a quite normal human being. He is not
  possessed by anything, and he has no special abilities. He is
  just a middle aged handicapped man, who writes bad poetry. The
  poetry isn't that special, except its subject. It has practically
  no effect on normal people, except boredom and maybe nausea at
  some of the themes. But any Garou will feel the presence of the
  Wyrm in his praise of death, entropy and corruption. The strength
  of his poetry is not its literary qualities, but his intense
  feeling for the Wyrm and its works. He is quite popular among the
  servants of the Wyrm, and copies of his poems are spread in
  secret.

     Whereabouts:
    </b>
    Anton spends most of his time in his
  house, a rather nice place in the suburbs. It was built to
  accommodate a wheelchair, and has several modifications to help
  Anton in his daily life. Inside it is neat and tidy. Anton spends
  most of his time in the living room, where he writes his poetry
  or reads. The walls are covered with shelves filled with books
  about chemistry, poetry, medicine and environmental issues. A
  perceptive visitor may notice marks of claws on the rug.

     Description:
    </b>
    Anton is a middle aged man in a
  wheelchair. He is slightly ruddy, and his hair is slowly turning
  grey at the temples. He speaks in a low voice, sometimes
  interrupted by coughs (but never when reading his poetry). His
  left arm is heavily scarred, and he has several burn scars on his
  body. He has always a couple of pencils and a notebook with
  poetry and notes in his breast pocket.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Personality:
    </b>
    His only solace in an otherwise quite
  dreary existence is his poetry. He can spend hours thinking about
  a single line, and completely forget his disability. In ordinary
  matters he is efficient, if not terribly enthusiastic. But as
  soon he gets onto the subject of his poetry or the works of the
  Wyrm, he becomes a new person. He can sit for hours and describe
  the beauty of burning oil or the cold elegance of the Third Law
  of Thermodynamics.

     Quote:
    </b>
    "The sacred oil mixes slowly with the curdling
  blood, into the... no, it doesn't work! I have this vision, but
  it simply won't stay on the paper... broken glass reflecting the
  flames... so beautiful!"

   <h2>
    Story Ideas:
   </h2>
   The Pack follows a servant of the Wyrm, and
  finds the poetry meetings. If they take the time to talk to Anton
  they might find that he is a rather nice man, who just happens to
  be in love with the Wyrm. He might even be useful, since he has
  an intuitive understanding of the Wyrm.
   <p>
    An Euthanatos mage stumbles upon Anton and his poetry. Is he
  ready for the Good Death? Or would he perhaps be an even greater
  Euthanatos? The appearance of a couple of Anton's "friends" may
  make things dangerous.
   </p>
   <p>
    A Toreador Antitribu learns about Anton's poetry, and will do
  anything to sire him. He is so perfect! This can create
  interesting problems for all involved, especially if the above
  scenarios are combined with this.
