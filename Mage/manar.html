   MANAR: Mana Activated by Naturally Asynchronous
  Resonance
  </h3>
  The technology behind MANAR is based on Resonant
  Crystals. These crystals are grown in zero gravity environments
  by Void Engineer masters of Matter. They are composed of free
  Quintessence hardened into a solid state and subsequently exposed
  to dynamic (vulgar) sphere magick causing them to resonate in
  quantum sympathy with the sphere magicks. Resonant crystals can
  thus be calibrated to vibrate at linearly related frequencies
  when exposed to specific types and amounts of magick. It is
  possible to set a threshold for certain sphere ratings.
  <p>
   The specific resonance effect prevents other sources of
  quintessence from interfering with mana scans, a substantial
  improvement over the wide spectrum MANAR which was subject to
  signal interference from Garou Cairns, Nodes, and powerful
  supernatural entities. Interference is still possible due to
  extraordinary levels of Quintessential discharge, Paradox Storms,
  and other forms of extreme reality alteration.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the more numerous amount of crystals increases the
  production and operating costs of MANAR apparatus by an estimated
  67.984% (twice as much quintessence expenditure, and one more dot
  in talismans). Although requiring at least nine crystals to
  detect all forms of reality alteration with no interference, and
  even more to detect other sources of Quintessence, MANAR
  apparatus has shrunk in size due to improvements in crystal
  purity and nanoprocessor technology, enabling final product size
  at least 1/10 the size available only three years ago.
  </p>
  <p>
   A typical MANAR apparatus now includes a wide spectrum crystal
  and several specifically resonant crystals connected to a
  Iteration X corresponding nanoprocessor. A standard display is
  color coded by Sphere/Quintessence type and appears on a
  flatscreen. The display can be made three dimensional if Comglass
  (by moolick) or holographic display technology is utilized. Most
  larger MANAR stations now include Comglass to handle the
  Corresponding necessary for the crystals to resonate, bypassing
  the need for a Corresponding nanoprocessor (but not for a
  non-corresponding processor of some sort).
  </p>
  <p>
   Technomancers have long known of resonant crystals which occur
  naturally as Tass near certain isolated nodes. Usually these Tass
  crystals displayed wide spectrum resonance unless exposed to a
  mage who used them in spellcasting. The drained crystals became
  resonant with the type of magick they powered, if they survived
  the magick intact. The first artifically resonant crystals were
  created in 1957 onboard Sputnik. These crystals were not recoved
  when Sputnik was recovered by Soviet Void Engineers and are
  presumed to have been destroyed by the pressures of atmospheric
  re-entry.
  </p>
  <p>
   In an emergency situation, resonant crystals from MANAR
  apparatus' can be kitbashed and utilized as a source of energy.
  This essentially ruins the apparatus by altering the resonance of
  the crystals. The crystals are not mana batteries and may shatter
  during use. Purification and restoring the original resonance is
  a tedious and expensive process, crystals spoiled in this manner
  are typically recycled into raw materiel.
  </p>
  <p>
   Project: Windchime was responsible for the improvements to
  MANAR, the project is still working on refinements to MANAR
  technology but has been the subject of severe cutbacks now that
  the initial goal of the project has been reached.

  <h3>
   GAME MECHANICS:
  </h3>
  Specifically Resonant MANAR costs one dot
  more in the talisman background (from two to five dots, depending
  on size) than the cost in Technocracy: NWO. It uses two points of
  quintessence per scanning duration (scene) and reduces the
  difficulties of the Arete activation and Perception+Awareness
  rolls by one.
  <p>
   The amount of information received by scanning with MANAR is
  still determined by Perception + Alertness, difficulty based on
  range, density of supernatual activity etc.
  </p>
  <p>
   With one success the Sphere used or type of Supernatural
  Entity and the general location of the disturbance can be
  determined. Nodes' locations are revealed exactly.
  </p>
  <p>
   Two successes the Level of Sphere/Blood Points spent/Gift
  level etc.. and general location can be determined. A Node's
  exact rating is determined.
  </p>
  <p>
   Three successes allow the Level of Effect, and a specific
  location to be revealed (within 100 feet) giving a -1 difficulty
  to subsequent attempts to track. A Node's current level of tass
  is determined. The current amount of Tass at a Node is
  determined.
  </p>
  <p>
   Four successes allow a Target Lock on the subject and gives a
  -2 difficulty to track them. A Node's specific bent (whether it
  is a Cairn/Freehold/Haunt) can be determined.
  </p>
  <p>
   Five successes Locks on, as well as revealing exactly how much
  quintessence/blood/gnosis/glamour/pathos is present in the zone
  being scanned.
