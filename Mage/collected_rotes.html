   INTRODUCTION TO THE ROTE LIBRARY
  </h1>
  If you hold this tome,
  you already know too much. Any good Technocrat would kill you and
  your cabal just to get a glance at this list. Use it wisely.
  <p>
   The Rote Library (v. 1.0) is the opus of a group of dedicated
  online individuals. Favorite rotes were sent in, and were
  subsequently compiled into a compact text file. This is only the
  first incarnation of the rote library. In the coming months, the
  RL will become a living Web page, where visitors are free to
  borrow and deposit rotes. Excelsior!
  </p>
  <p>
   DISCLAIMER: The editor has repeatedly spellchecked and laid
  out this file for your convenience. He does not vouch for the
  game mechanics, accuracy, or consistency of any rote included in
  this tome. For that matter, he is not responsible for any rotes
  that you may find stupid. Remember, that same stupid rote may be
  the one a Man In Black fries you with. Lighten up, its just a
  game.
  </p>
  <h1>
   THE ROTES
  </h1>
  <h2>
   ICE
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Mind 1, Life 1, Prime 2, Entropy 2 or 5
  </h3>
  <h4>
   Virtual Adepts
  </h4>
  This rote was created by a VA who was
  humiliated at being Dominated by a vampire. It functions like the
  Encrypt Thoughts rote from the VA, with the added benefit of
  protecting against all non-magickal attempts to control the
  user's thoughts or emotions. (The Entropy component provides a
  scrambling effect.)
  <p>
   [Each success removes two success from any Discipline, Gift,
  or Arcanos roll to influence the protected mind. If Entropy 2 is
  used, it provides protection against attacks that are ranked less
  than or equal to the user's Arete. If Entropy 5 is used, it
  shields against all levels. (Encrypt Thoughts can provide some
  protection, but only against attacks ranked equal to or lower
  than the user's Sphere level.) Forces 3 or Mind 3,4 or 5 may be
  added toautomatically attack any would-be controller, but this
  usually makes the rote vulgar.]
  </p>
  <h2>
   HOMONCULUS
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Matter 4, Life 3, Prime 2, Spirit 2
  </h3>
  <h4>
   Sons of Ether
  </h4>
  This lovely Rote was designed by a Son of
  Ether, Ephriam Leeds, who desired the perfect companion. Of
  course, his ideals for perfection were a little warped. He
  decided that the only way he was going to find this companion was
  to build it himself. Using his knowledge in the sphere of matter
  he created a fully functioning automaton of Iron. But it was sill
  unliving, he wanted it to live. So he gave it life, and bound the
  two together with the Prime. But it was purley an instictual
  creature, Ephraim wanted a thinking companion, with a spirit.
  This being the case Ephraim sought out a spirit that was both
  trustworthy and willing to be his companion. The spirit for his
  companion now found, he proceeded to bind it to his machine, for
  that is truly what his companion was, a living, thinking machine.
  <p>
   [Functionally this Rote makes use of a relatively simple
  Matter 4 effect in the construction of the Homunculus. Next the
  Life sphere, aided by the spark of Prime, grants the form true
  life, and binds the pattern in to permanence. Great care must be
  taken in the design of the pattern as any(!) flaw in the pattern
  can cause the creature to die an agonizing death immidaiately
  after it's creation. As such, most mages who use this Rote take
  there time to insure that the patter is in no way flawed, designs
  of such intricacy have been known to take a full year or better
  to complete, as such this is not a rote to be under taken
  lightly. An umbrood spirit is then bound into the machine by a
  variation of the rote Imbue Flesh (Mage pg. 224 (1st Ed.)).
  </p>
  <p>
   [The more successes rolled, the greater the chance that the
  machine will be self sufficient. Three successes is the minimum
  needed to create a viable homunculus. Any less and all that is
  created is a perfect, non-living, unreceptive to spiritual
  inhabitation, robot. At three successes the homunculus, is
  capable of survival on it's own as long as its physical
  requirements are provided for by it's master (i.e. it's alive it
  needs to eat, but it doesn't know how to find what it needs). At
  four successes the creature inherently knows it's needs and can
  acquire them without the aid of its master. At five successes,
  the creature is completely self-sufficient, and in fact
  instictively knows it's master's dietary requirements, and may
  even be capable of taking care of an ill creator. Note that as
  the Spirit sphere is used, to give it a "soul" the Mind sphere is
  not needed.]

  [ Used with a focus. It stops time until
  the action triggering the rote is redone. Examples: snapping the
  fingers, removing glasses, switching on a vibrator. Vulgar

   SCHNIDER’S BUTTLINE
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Correspondence 3
  </h3>
  Schnider liked to look good for the
  babes, but his wallet ruined the smooth seat of his pants,
  obscuring the view. So he makes it appear that all that cash,
  credit cards, IDs, etc come from this slim wallet.
  <p>
   [The Mage keeps his items in a safe place and reaches to it
  when needed. Sometimes he will use this method to pop into other
  places to get cash. Why use the ATM when you can access the
  vault?&gt;
  </p>
  <h2>
   YID’S MENTAL ANSWERING MACHINE
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Mind 3, Time 1
  </h3>
  Annoyed by the mental interruptions his
  companion made, Yid came up with this rote using a form of
  Multi-Tasking.
  <p>
   [When the Mage is concetrating on a problem, mental visitors
  receive this message, "[Mage’s name] is busy at the moment.
  Please leave a message at the gong." Note that Time can make this
  a more structured event.]
  </p>
  <h2>
   BALL OF GATHERED FLAME
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Forces 2, Prime 1
  </h3>
  <h4>
   Order of Hermes
  </h4>
  [The Mage moves her hands about the air,
  fingers lightly spread while speaking the correct magickal words
  to congeal the light. It takes on a cob-webby texture and begins
  collecting in the Magi's hand as if it were indeed cob-webs the
  Mage was raking her hand through. As the Mage collects this
  light, she leaves behind darkness, which commonly appears as
  shadows hanging in mid air. After several swipes, enough light is
  collected in the hand to form a ball that just fits in the hand.
  Charging this with 1 point of Quintessence (which makes it glow
  brightly). The Mage then hurls this at her target, rolling Dex +
  Athletics diff 6. The ball itself can travel until it comes in
  contact with something, and will continue in exactly the same
  direction it was going when it was released. Upon impact, it
  bursts into an area of intense light twice its diameter, doing
  Magickal Successes in aggravated damage.]
  <h2>
   WOLF BIND
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Life 3, Spirit 3
  </h3>
  <h4>
   Dreamspeakers
  </h4>
  This rote alows the mage to attempt to
  suppress or "bind" the form of a Garou. It attemps to both
  physically and spiritually bind the Lupine. [Diff # = Rage of
  Target, cumulative successes must = or &gt; Gnosis. If successful
  the Garou will either revert to lupus, homid, or the individaul's
  natral form (making this a bad thing to use against metis.)
  <h2>
   CIRCLE WARD
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Entropy 2, Prime 2, Spirit 3
  </h3>
  <h4>
   Order of Hermes
  </h4>
  This rote enables the user to subtly
  alter the umbral area around him to set up a protective shield.
  <p>
   [Entropy/Prime causes the incoming effect to "leak"
  quintessence and thus lose its reality. Prime/Spirit sets up the
  Spirit field and supplies it w/ quint. Successes = # of automatic
  countermagic dice the mage gets. Unfortunately, the area is
  immobile. Normal "non-magical" effects would get through
  normally.]
  </p>

  <h3>
   Correspondence 3
  </h3>
  <h4>
   Akashic Brotherhood
  </h4>
  [You throw a knife. A foot from
  hitting the target you co-locate the knife five times around the
  target - the target is now hit by 5 knifes, not one! Or you spray
  a target with automatic fire, as above, co-locate the bullets
  making several copies that surround the target - so the target
  can be hit by literally dozens of bullets. This can be explained
  by either saying you have incredible control over automatic
  weapons, or your shots riccochet (rebound?) and just so happen to
  hit the target.]
  <h2>
   MSHIELD
  </h2>
  <h3>
   All 1
  </h3>
  <h4>
   Virtual Adepts
  </h4>
  This Rote solidifies the mage's personal
  reality. The effect is limited to her own Pattern and any
  patterns of matter that she is carrying when it begins. MShield
  has no effects on spells already affecting the mage, but all
  magic directed at her while the Shield is up is opposed, even the
  mage's own.
  <p>
   [This rote lasts the standard duration. The highest level
  effect that can be opposed is equal to the number of success
  gained. Such an effect loses one success. For each level below
  the maximum, an additional success is taken away. This effect is
  cumulative with the mage's countermagick and resistance rolls, so
  it can render her nearly invulnerable to lesser magicks. However,
  any magic the mage casts on herself is also affected. Unlike
  regular countermagick, MShield does not offer any help to others
  targeted by the same spell as the caster, nor does it stop
  indirect effects (those that are not resisted by Willpower). This
  rote is static magic.]
  </p>
  <h2>
   1-800-QUINTESSENCE
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Correspondence 2, Prime 1
  </h3>
  <h4>
   Virtual Adepts
  </h4>
  [This rote was invented by Virtual Adepts
  having problems with getting Quintessence when they were far from
  their nodes. However, by using the ordinary phone-network or
  internet to call a computer or phone near their home node, the
  Adepts can connect to it and absorb needed quintessence. This
  rote has been expanded to higher levels, using the networks as
  conduits for quintessence to their uses.]
  <h2>
   PATTERN LOCK
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Correspondence 2, Life or Matter 1
  </h3>
  <h4>
   Virtual Adepts
  </h4>
  This Rote traces a designated pattern
  (life or matter) anywhere within range. The effect lasts until it
  wares of, is dispelled, or the pattern being followed changes.
  While in effect the caster knows the relative location (direction
  and distance) of the pattern regardless of how it moves.
  <p>
   The Mage plants a bug on the target, target inadvertently
  leaves an obvious trial (mud on his shoes, distinctive scent),
  bystanders point out the target, mage dusts the target with an
  invisible radioactive powder, mage tracks target using spy
  satellite, mage brilliantly deduces target's destination.
  </p>
  <p>
   [The number of success rolled determines how long and at what
  distance (using the Correspondence range chart) the Lock can be
  maintained. Note that patterns of life change slowly over time,
  so a living creature could be traced for no more than a few days
  regardless of the number of success obtained. The caster knows
  the locked pattern's location well enough for it to be considered
  within line of sight. The spatial distortion caused by a Pattern
  Lock is much less obtrusive than normal Correspondence
  Perceptions, unless specifically searched for, it can be detected
  only by disciples of both correspondence and pattern magic,
  specifically looking for it, who make a Perception + Awareness
  roll (difficulty 8).]
  </p>
  <h2>
   CD (CHANGE DIRECTORY)
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Correspondence 3
  </h3>
  <h4>
   Virtual Adepts
  </h4>
  Also called GOTO, this Rote allows the
  V-dept to instantly move to a different locality. Localities must
  be previously designated by a name (label or line number) and
  have a defined 'pointer' to their position in three-space. Short
  'hops' to nearby areas are not possible, nor can the mage go to
  places he has never seen or heard of.
  <p>
   [This is a straight forward teleportation rote. Between two
  and four successes are usually needed since line of sight is
  disallowed as is the 'anywhere in the world' range. The Rote only
  takes the mage to a general area, the exact point of arrival is
  random. The mage should keep a listing of her 'directory tree.
  This Rote is usually Vulgar&gt;
  </p>
  <h2>
   R.A.D.S.
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Correspondence 3, Forces 1, Matter 1, Life 1, Entropy 1
  </h3>
  <h4>
   Virtual Adepts
  </h4>
  The mage dodges, opponent telegraphs her
  blow, mage slips and falls out of the way, a moving vehicle
  blocks the attacker's line of sight, the mage is blown clear of
  the exploding fireball and lands in the midst of an outdoor
  mattress sale.
  <p>
   The Rapid Avoidance Defensive System is an ongoing
  conjunctional effect that analyzes patterns that are about to
  contact the mage and, if they prove dangerous, removes her to the
  nearest safe location. It is imperfect - the mage can be hit by a
  skilled opponent. Less advanced RADS versions simply gauge the
  magnitude of forces involved and avoid those beyond a certain
  threshold. This can be annoying since the forces involved in a
  friendly pat on the back can exceed those of a curare-tipped
  dart. The rote takes into account only immediate, physical,
  threats so a mage could find herself displaced from a hiding
  place, separated from an injured comrade, or face to face with a
  Neqhandus master. If the displacement occurs when the mage is
  making an attack, her attack is usually spoiled as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   [RADS can move the mage anywhere within range (based on the
  correspondence range chart) but always minimizes the distance
  travelled. Each success removes one success from any attempt to
  hit the mage that has the potential to do the threshold level of
  damage. This is cumulative with dodging, but the mage must decide
  to dodge before the attack is rolled. If RADS activates at the
  mage's initiative, she suffers the same penalty to her attack and
  may have to make a Wits + Alertness roll to retain her bearings.
  If the mage is caught in an area attack or attacked by forces
  magic, RADS will take her out of the area or break line of sight
  with the attacker. This often involves a long distance teleport
  to a familiar location - and the accumulation of paradox.]
  </p>
  <h2>
   RANDOM ACCESS MATERIALITY
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Correspondence 3
  </h3>
  <h4>
   Virtual Adepts
  </h4>
  The mage is hidden by smoke or fog and is
  only intermittently visible; she leads her opponents into a well
  known maze like area, hall of mirrors etc, where her location is
  hard to determine and she may appear to be in places she is not;
  the mage has previously set up mirrors, dummies, and or disguised
  sleepers to mislead her opponents.
  <p>
   This Rote allows the mage to move to any location within line
  of sight. A skilled caster can 'blink' among multiple locations
  almost instantly. Remember that correspondence sensing and
  co-location sensing provide line of sight. One common tactic is
  to use co-location sensing to remain aware of two different areas
  and then blink back and forth between them.
  </p>
  <p>
   [The mage can make a number of blinks each turn equal to the
  number of successes scored. The mage controls both when and where
  she goes. Blinking will spoil one opponent's attack if the mage
  times it properly. All opponents trying to hit the mage have
  their difficulty raised by one per blink the mage has made so far
  that turn. In any turn that she blinks, the mage's own
  difficulties for physical actions are raised by one. The Rote
  lasts a normal duration but only those locations in line of sight
  during casting are accessible.]
  </p>
  <h2>
   REMOTE ACCESS
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Correspondence 3, Mind 1
  </h3>
  <h4>
   Virtual Adepts
  </h4>
  Basic Remote Access is just our version of
  Divided Sight (see MAGE p.186). Hackers add a twist by
  conjunctionally Multi- Tasking so that they can keep track of
  more locations without 'burning out.' They then recursively
  invoke the module at each new location, forming a chain or mesh
  of 'links' and 'nodes' (nodes in the sense of telecommunications,
  not mystical Nodes where Tass collects). When angry technarcs try
  to Stalk the Void (see Mage p.188) to the offending mage, there's
  time to break the connection before they arrive. I only tried
  this once, but it worked like a charm.
  <p>
   [The maximum number of 'nodes' the mage can maintain is equal
  to his Perception attribute times the number of success obtained
  in Multi-Tasking (not the total number of 'Tasks' since one is
  used to co-ordinate). The numbr of links established at each
  casting is one plus one per success beyond those needed for the
  most difficult node. For instance, a mage trying to establish
  three nodes, two in familiar locations and one that he has only
  heard of, would need six successes - four to establish the node
  in the location described to him and one for each of the familiar
  areas. Nodes created in a single casting are in a 'star topology'
  - each one is connected only to the mage's location. To create a
  link between two distant nodes the mage must cast the spell from
  one node using the normal range chart instead of the
  Correspondence one. Since the node is in line of sight, four
  successes are required (unless the new node is totally
  unfamiliar). Note that this range is from the mage to the node
  from which the link is to be established, not the range from the
  established node the new one. When someone Stalks the Void from
  an end node, he simply reaches the next node in the network. If
  there are several connections the one found is random. Adepts who
  are wise to this trick can 'trace' the links - cascading across
  one link per success. However, in a complex network, it is likely
  the tracer will loop as it randomly chooses a path. The only
  coincidental effect I've ever heard of for this Rote is
  'Hacking.' The mage simply 'breaks into' computer systems at each
  location she wishes to view, establishing a convoluted path of
  communications lines that enemies must trace to find her.]
  </p>
  <h2>
   SITE TO SITE TRANSPORT
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Correspondence 3, Mind 1
  </h3>
  <h4>
   Virtual Adepts
  </h4>
  This Rote takes the mage to a specific,
  pre-determined location. Often, a series of locations is
  'programmed' ahead of time. All such locations must be personally
  memorized by the mage (thus the mind aspect, for eidetic memory).
  This rote is very simple, often requiring only a single key
  stroke like [HOME] or [RETURN].
  <p>
   [Site to Site Transport differs from the classic Seven League
  Stride primarily in that the target location is always well
  known. Two successes are all that is needed to remove the mage to
  the next programmed location. Extra successes are required if the
  mage wishes to 'cascade' through several localities, spending
  anywhere from a fraction of a second to a few turns in each
  intermediate location. As long as her computer is up and running,
  the V-dept can activate this Rote with no initiative penalty.
  This Rote is almost always Vulgar magick.]
  </p>
  <h2>
   VECTOR MATRIX COMPUTATION
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Correspondence 3
  </h3>
  <h4>
   Virtual Adepts
  </h4>
  The mage leaps upon a passing vehicle, is
  picked up by a helicopter, dons a pre-placed jet pack, had a
  parachute carefully packed in her backpack when she jumped from
  the plane.
  <p>
   This unusual Rote causes the mage to move through space with
  an apparently smooth motion through a series of micro-teleports.
  She can appear to walk, levitate, or even fly. The main advantage
  of this kind of movement is that it can be more easily covered by
  static effects. Even though she appears to be moving, the mage
  has no momentum and causes no damage in a collision.
  </p>
  <p>
   [One success allows the mage to move at normal human speeds -
  no more than about 10 mph, two success allow ground vehicle
  speeds (under 100 mph), three grant aircraft-like speeds of
  hundreds of mph, four success allow super-sonic flight (no sonic
  booms though), and five will let the mage move at basically any
  speed she wishes.]
  </p>
  <h2>
   THREAT ASSESSMENT
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Forces 1, Entropy 1, Life 1
  </h3>
  <h4>
   Virtual Adepts
  </h4>
  The mage has heard (accurate) rumors about
  the subject, is familiar with subject's style (Ah...You trained
  with Master Wu.), has made a study of the types of weapons being
  employed, etc.
  <p>
   The Virtual Adepts use this Rote to estimate the relative
  danger posed by an opponent or other hazard. Threat Assessment
  does not reveal unknown dangers, it merely quantifies those the
  mage is already aware of. Thus, it is usually used in conjunction
  with another sense such as normal sight, Inertial Location or
  Composite Virtual Imaging. Threat Assessment gives the mage a
  good idea of the power of attacks the opponent can throw and of
  the attackers' speed and skill. Use of this Rote can make dodging
  attacks a little easier but does no otherwise overtly effect
  combat.
  </p>
  <p>
   [The 'area' affected indicates the number of opponents
  'Assessed.' For instance, one success would give the mage
  information about a single attacker in melee. Regardless of the
  number of successes, the mage can tell the approximate size of
  the subject's attack and damage dice pools. Assessed attacks can
  be dodged at a -1 difficulty. It has no effect on magical attacks
  unless the mage is a disciple of all the spheres involved.]
  </p>
  <h2>
   RIKER'S ISLAND
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Mind 1, Life 1
  </h3>
  <h4>
   Virtual Adepts
  </h4>
  No man is an island - except for this guy.
  The mage is a sociopath, completely cut off from normal human
  interaction, or has been trained using bio-feedback or self
  hypnosis, or just has the perfect poker face (like a certain 1st
  Officer in a popular SF series).
  <p>
   Many V-depts are classic 'computer nerds' with limited social
  skills. Sure, you can countermagick Thought Probes in your sleep,
  but the wily Toreador can tell almost as much from the way your
  eyelid's flutter when she asks you a question. This is what we
  call a non-trivial problem. The answer is Riker's Island, a
  Module that edits out unconscious reactions and body language -
  even controls respiration and galvanic skin response. With it you
  have the ultimate poker face and can even beat lie detectors.
  Iteration X uses this Rote under the name 'Machine Interface' and
  the Men In Black seem to have it hardwired into their brains.
  </p>
  <p>
   [For the duration of the magick, all attempts to read the mage
  using skills like Subterfuge as well as non-magical lie detectors
  automatically fail. Users of subterfuge will note that the
  character is concealing something (even if he isn't) but can't
  tell what.]
  </p>
  <h2>
   COMPOSITE VIRTUAL IMAGING
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Correspondence 1, Mind 1 or 2, Any other spheres 1
  </h3>
  <h4>
   Virtual Adepts
  </h4>
  This Rote integrates a mage's various
  senses (as a Disciple of multiple Spheres) into a single virtual
  reality (cf Landscape in the Mind). Patterns are represented by
  'icons' and quintessence and ley lines are superimposed in
  glowing gold, while a clock icon measures time to the nearest
  nano-second. The mage can 'select' patterns for a complete
  analysis, 'switch screens' to view the Near Umbra or invoke a
  'diagnostic' to assess the entropy of the area. Skilled Disciples
  can also detect the presence of minds and correlate them to the
  patterns they inhabit. Of course, magical effects going off near
  the mage are immediately noted. All this assumes a disciple of
  nine spheres - a rare mage indeed, However, any number of spheres
  may be used.
  <p>
   [Range of this rote is more limited than for other
  Correspondence effects:
  </p>
  <pre>
   # Successes/Radius Perceived
1       6' - mage's personal space
2       20' - large room
3       20yds - good sized house
4       100yds - stadium, high rise
5       1/4 mile - city block, industrial park
  </pre>
  Furthermore, if more than four spheres are being used,
require an additional success. Remember the mage only gets all the
above effects if she casts the Rote conjunctional with all nine
spheres. Also note that all the mage gets for using Mind one is the
ability to detect incoming Mind effects. Few coincidental effects
will cover the broad range of senses granted. Examples include
Sherlock Homes-like deduction, a 'thorough' briefing of the area,
or (for short durations) lucky guesses or intuition.]
  <h2>
   EXTENDED MEMORY MANAGER
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Mind 1
  </h3>
  <h4>
   Virtual Adepts
  </h4>
  This Rote allows the mage to remember
  large amounts of data with perfect clarity. It can be used to
  preserve specific memories or to retrieve largely forgotten ones.
  Mages who store too much information can experience side effects
  like confusion as sensory cues cause a flood of associated
  memories or an inability to remember without using the Rote. Some
  mages find it necessary to 'purge' old memories to make way for
  fresh data. Combined with other senses and Mind effects, the EMM
  becomes even more useful. For instance, the mage can flip through
  a book, then Multi-Task and have one task carefully read it from
  memory or 'rewind' her memory of a recent encounter to look for
  details that her conscious mind overlooked.
  <p>
   [To imprint a photographic memory, the mage rolls her Arete
  with the number of successes indicating how long (on the normal
  duration chart) the memory is retained with perfect clarity.
  During this duration the mage can look back just as if she were
  still experiencing the memory even to the point of noticing
  details for the first time. After the duration is up, the memory
  fades to normal levels of recall. To retrieve a forgotten
  experience, the mage rolls with successes read on the duration
  chart to indicate how far back she can remember. Clarity is high
  but she cannot notice new details - only those which she noted at
  some point but has forgotten. Photographic and Eidetic mnemonic
  abilities are a documented fact, making this Rote static
  magic.]

  <h2>
   MATH CO-PROCESSOR

  <h3>
   Mind 1
  </h3>
  <h4>
   Virtual Adepts
  </h4>
  Virtual Adepts view the human brain as
  nothing more than a tremendously complex, biological computer.
  This Rote allows them to tap the brain's vast, untapped
  computational power. While it is in effect, the mage can perform
  mathematical calculations at a rate rivalling the most powerful
  computers.
  <p>

   The V-dept version of a classic Akashic Rote, Signal Filter
  evaluates incoming neural signals, intercepting excessive pain

  Filter is dangerous because the mage using it cannot tell the
  severity of her injury without carefully examining her pattern.
  She can feel enough to tell she was hurt and where the damage is
  but not how dangerous it is. In any case, the Rote in no way
  reduces the damage taken.

  the wound chart by one level. The mage can even act while
  Incapacitated for up to one turn per success. Duration is

  positively ID the spirit. She can then tell whether it is a

  Presented with the severed finger of an
  unknown murder victim, Tony King set about attempting to discover
  the full physical appearance of the deceased. By using a number
  of carefully calibrated electrical fields, he extrapolated the
  full physical form of the victim's etheric pattern in
  three-dimensional space, then carefully sculpted a large block of
  soft clay using strong electromagnetic fields in order to produce
  a life-size model of the victim's body, in quite superb detail.
  <p>
   [The mage must have some part of the corpse from which to
  extrapolate the physical form, and a fair amount of some kind of
  modelling media (Clay, wet sand, blu-tak, whatever). Difficulty
  is a base of 6, but would be harder for older corpses (+1 to
  difficulty for 1 month since death, +2 for a year, +3 for a
  decade and so on). Similarly, the amount of cadaver the mage has
  to work on would affect difficulty - extrapolating a decapitated
  head from a whole body would be fairly easy, but a whole body
  from a couple of hairs is close to impossible.
  </p>
  <p>
   [The level of detail available depends on the number of
  successes the mage gets, and the time the mage is willing to put
  into the project. Subtract 1 from the difficulty for every extra
  day the mage puts into the extrapolation. [1 success will give a
  rough shape (build, proportion) and a hint at facial features. 2
  successes will give enough detail for the subject to be
  recognizable. 3 successes will give something which looks almost
  exactly like the subject; 4 or 5 successes will give things like
  birthmarks, moles, the finer structure of hair, and dissection of

  First of all - you are now a particle and a wave. You do not
  exist here, but rather over a continuum within set boundary
  conditions (like walls). The visual effect is that you appear in
  many places at once (your most probablility dense zones) and you
  are actually at all of them (without Corr 4!!!). You can also
  exhibit quantum tunnelling effects. You can go through walls if
  they are not suffucient barriers to stop your wavefunction. The
  disadvantages are that being a quantum particle the uncertainty
  principle effects you alot. When the effect is dropped, you can
  end up being anywhere your wavefunction existed. You are also
  disorientated by this experience. But can anyone hide something
  in an area better than thin rote. Total randomness and limited
  invulnerability to the wavefunctions from standard means of
  attack. Note area effects are the most effective against quantum
  particles but there are times when they don't work. A clever rote

   This rote allows a mage to adopt an icon (portrait, doll,
  book) to which she is tethered. As long as the icon remains
  intact, the mage will remain the same age as when the rote was
  cast. She is not immortal; the magickal icon simply holds back
  the forces that age the body. When it is time to die, she will
  indeed die (though she will leave a lovely corpse). The danger of
  this rote lies in the consequences of destroying the icon: the
  shock of aging 50 years is enough to kill most people.
  </p>
  <p>
   [Life and Mind tie the mage macickally to the icon; prime
  “seals the deed”. Entropy forces the entropy of aging
  to age the icon instead of the mage. Should the icon be
  destroyed, the mage must make a stamina roll, difficulty 5+1 for
  every ten years since the rote was cast. Failure indicates the
  mage dies of shock. The icon also gains a point of Paradox for
  every ten years it has been used; if the mage survives, he
  absorbs the Paradox as well.

  [By combining two matter effects on a bladed
  weapon, one can obtain the useful ability to cut through solid
  objects. The first effect uses Matter 3: Sculpture to hone the
  blades' edge to a mono-molecular point and makes the surface of
  the blade almost frictionless, thereby allowing the blade itself
  to cut through just about anything easily. The second effect uses
  Matter 3: Destroy Structure to rend the pattern of the object
  just ahead of the blade's edge. Without this second effect, the
  monomolecular blade would dull almost instantly and become
  useless. This effect is vulgar or coincidental depending on the
  substance being cut. Most people would not believe granite can be
  cut by mere metal, but haven't we all heard about the legendary
  sharpness of the old samurai swords?]

   ENTROPIC THOUGHT
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Entropy 2, Mind 1-4
  </h3>
  This rote allows the Mage to jump to
  startling conclusions about any situation (s)he is in. The Mage
  can sometimes appear to have remarkable deductive powers when
  utilising this rote and at other times (s)he can appear quite mad
  as (s)he makes connections which normal people would consider
  ludicrous or quite impossible. As a simple example, take the case
  of a Mage who has no skill in Matter or Correspondence but who
  wishes to find a hidden item (maybe the gun used as a murder
  weapon.) He paces to room with a thoughtful expression on his
  face then, suddenly, he is reminded of a murder/mystery novel in
  which the weapon was hidden behind the mantelpiece. Sure enough,
  the aforementioned weapon is there when he asks the bewildered
  policemen to search it. Of course, they may now wonder how he
  knew it was there and ask some fairly urgent questions about
  where he was on a particular night..
  <p>
   [The mage utilises Mind 1 to flash through all her memories
  and then Entropy 2 (Control Randomness) to select one. The use of
  Entropy ensures that the thought selected is somehow relevant to
  the situation. The more successes gleaned the more information is
  gained. A failure indicates a mental block while a botch means
  that some completely irrelevant thought has just implanted itself
  in the mages consciousness. The mage may spend days (and they
  should roleplay this) wondering how such a thought could be
  relevant - "Pink, fluffy bunnies... what do pink fluffy bunnies
  have to do Lord Greesham's murder...Hmm, maybe I'll check out the
  petting zoo..." [This rote does require a great deal of
  storyteller/player co-operation (Hah! Don't make me laugh!) It
  can been used to allow player knowledge to become character
  knowledge but any storyteller who wishes to allow this should
  place strict control on what is allowed. The thoughts should be
  as vague as possible and have some relevance to the mages
  background. For instance, the character above, who clearly reads
  a lot of Agatha Christie, or the Order of Hermes Mage who marvels
  at the way the numbers on the signpost beneath which the
  Nephandus has buried a talisman are of occult significance ("See,
  if you add those two together you get 13, and if you subtract
  that number you get 7. Hah, these Nephandi, predictable as
  ever...")]

   THE EVER-FULL FOUNTAIN
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Life 4, Matter 3, Prime 2
  </h3>
  This rote manipulates the blood
  solute content of the target so that it influences the his/her
  health. The most common use for this rote is to increase the
  sodium/salt concentration in the patients blood plasma. Small
  changes like these are able to have huge knock-on effects on the
  target's health. Increased salt in the blood causes many problems
  to physiological function. The most prominent effect is that the
  target urinates a lot more and hence loses fluid from the blood.
  This causes low blood pressure which leads, in severe and acute
  cases, to shock and possible fatality. Death from hypernatraemia
  (high sodium blood content) is not unusual and so the rote could
  be coincidental if applied in the right situation. The name from
  this rote came from the Modern Verbena who are rather amused by
  the unfortunate victim's predicament. Other traditions have
  variably called it 'The Pissing Evil' (in reference to Sir Thomas
  Willis, an English physician, discussing Diabetes in the 17th
  Century) and 'Remote Manipulation of Natriatic Factors' (the Sons
  of the Ether if you hadn't already guessed.)
  <p>
   [The 4th rank of Life is required to effect another living
  human. Matter 3/Prime 2 is used to cause the appropriate solute
  to appear in the blood. An INT + MEDICINE roll should also be
  required in order to control the amounts in the blood. The more
  successes the closer the mage gets to being able to get the
  required effect. For instance, the mage may want to kill his
  victim in which case high successes means that he has succeeded
  in that, However, he may need to keep his victim alive in which
  case a successful roll is needed to get the right level of solute
  which will inconvenience but not kill. The storyteller should
  also consider the time-scale involved. Death within a short time
  of being exposed to the rote should be easier, as the body has
  few short term defences against hypernatraemia, but is more
  likely to be suspicious to investigating police and/or doctors.
  Long term (chronic) exposure to the rote should be more difficult
  (add 2 or even 3 to the difficulty of the medicine roll) due to
  the natural defenses but less suspicious.
  </p>
  <p>
   [Calculate actual damage from the Life damage chart but
  describe the effects as internal problems rather than wounds. For
  instance, 1-2 health levels of damage should mean that the target
  is inconvenienced by the need to constantly go to the toilet and
  drink lots of fluids. 3+ health levels means that the victim is
  in a state of shock (with the attendant symptoms which should get
  worse the more damage is done) An incapacitated or dead result
  indicates irreversible shock and the victim will require a
  transfusion to prevent death. Other chemicals may enter the blood
  via this route. For instance, the Cult of Ecstasy use it to avoid
  all those problems with needles and syringes which often occur
  with drug use. The effects of such things entering the mages
  system is up to the storyteller. The mage may also use it to
  remove chemicals from the blood - poisons, drugs, even essential
  chemicals such as haemoglobin. One final note for the
  storyteller. The effects of this rote are quite good as paradox
  flaws as long as they are not fatal.]

  <h4>
   Cult of Ecstacy
  </h4>
  This rote was designed by the Cult of
  Ectasy as a joking way of utilising Chaos theory. The cultist
  usually uses it when (s)he has not got access to a map, when
  (s)he wants to go somewhere in a hurry or just to upset and
  frighten sleepers (and other mages) who (s)he happens to be
  sharing a car with.
  <p>
   The rote involves simpily picking out a car or other vehicle
  from the many passing by and setting out to follow it to its
  intended destination. The mage can select the car using a variety
  of criteria including its colour, shape, year - whatever takes
  the mages fancy at the time. It is, however, reccomended that the
  car be travelling in at least something resembling the right
  direction to start with if the effect is to be considered
  coincidental. With luck (sorry, with a willing avatar) the car
  the mage follows is just happening to be going somewhere near to
  the place where the mage wants to go. This rote can be quite
  disconcerting for passengers, especially if the cultist still
  requires a focus for some of the spheres. This can mean that the
  mage may need to employ narcotics or other illegal drugs while
  driving (God knows what (s)he will need to if her/his vice is
  playing the guitar or sex.) However, to offset the effects of
  this a Mind/Life effect can be instigated to keep the mage
  sober.
  </p>
  <p>
   [The mage uses the sphere of Entropy to pick out a 'likely'
  vehicle based upon some criteria. For instance, it could be
  decided that the mage likes the colour red and would thus always
  follow red cars. More coincidental choices could come from
  reading the license plate -"It says California on the license so
  I assumed that it was going there..." or from following trucks
  and vans with company names on them. The number 29 bus to the
  area the mage wants to visit could also just happen to be passing
  at the time. Once the vehicle has been selected the mage locks
  onto it and follows it using Time and Correspondence to see where
  it is going and memorises the route using the sphere of Mind.
  Storytellers may well decide to enforce a roll of PER +Intuition
  (Diff 6) to see how well the mage understands the
  information.]

  <h4>
   New World Order
  </h4>
  This rote is often used by the New World
  Order to prevent the enemies of the pogrom from escaping. It is
  derived from the fact that most NWO operatives pose as official
  agents of some wordly power (i.e as government agents or Police
  Officers.) It is thus easy for them to set up this rote as a
  coincidence. The effect involves causing a moving vehicle to slow
  down and stop. This is achieved by two methods. The first is the
  manipulation of the driver's mind - causing him/her to believe
  that it would be a good idea to stop. The second, which is
  sometimes included as a precaution against the first method not
  working, involves manipulating kinetic forces so that the car can
  no longer move. A coincidental effect is easily maintained if the
  NWO mage is acting as a police officer as passers-by (and the
  'paradox police') simpily see an obvious law-breaker being pulled
  over by the police. It is very easy for a good NWO operative to
  dream up a charge to bring against an enemy of the pogrom.
  <p>
   [Mind 2 is first employed to cause the driver of the car to
  believe that he should slow down and stop. This is often
  reinforced by the presence of an obvious police presence as the
  agent masquerades as an official officer of the law. For those
  victims who are reluctant to stop the Forces 4, Prime 2 effect is
  activated in order to create an opposing force to the kinetic
  energy powering the vehicle - the vehicle is thus forced to a
  stop whether the occupants want it to or not...]

  fired at the Hit Mark, hitting it from 4 different angles at

   [Using Mind 1, the mage rids himself of using penalties from
  using his non-usual hand. With Correspondence 4, he then
  co-locates to as many positions as possible, and fires, splitting
  his dice pool evenly between the guns in each hand, hitting his
  opponent from differing locations at once. Damage is rolled as
  normal for each gun, and then multiplied by as many different
  locations at the mage has attained. Example: Bob rolls a 5, a 7,a
  7, and an 8 on his roll. He co-locates to 3 different places,
  making 4 copies of himself. He splits his dice pool of 7 between
  his hands, 4 in one, 3 in the other. Both guns are at difficulty
  six, and he rolls 6, 6, 7, 8, and 4, 6, 7 on the firing attack,
  then rolls damage, and multiplies it by 4 (The number of total
