  <h1>
   Emotions
  </h1>

   Kraftwerk in my auditory system. A complex geometric problem
  before me, where fractal sets meet on a projective plane. "Wir
  fahr'n fahr'n fahr'n auf der Autobahn...". It is beautiful in its
  clean simplicity. It is all a big web of connections, you know.
  Deep down, it is all mathematics.

   Many people believe we do not have emotions at all. That is
  wrong. Intelligence cannot exist without drive, just as drive
  without intelligence doesnÂ¹t lead anywhere. Studies show
  that people whose connections between the frontal lobe and limbic
  system are severed become not only emotionally incapable, but
  also unable to solve problems well. They do not feel an urge to
  try a new solution when they fail, they just continue trying
  small alterations of their previous plan in the hope it will
  work. Not unlike the robots in old science fiction.

   Of course, not all emotions are useful. Most only serve basic
  biological needs, like reproduction, escaping danger or finding
  food. They usually interfere with rational thinking, and today
  they do not help us solve our problems, they just cause more
  problems. On the other hand, emotions such as curiosity,
  interest, loyalty or irritation motivate us and helps us stay on
  track. Boredom, for example, is essential to rational thinking;
  if we never became bored we would soon end up in eternal loops
  waiting for buses that never come or doing everything in the same
  inefficient way without finding a better solution.

   For example, this internal monologue has a purpose beside
  using some processors that are not needed for the main problem I
  am solving. It allows me to analyse the motivations and thought
  patterns that I currently have, which in turn will simplify the
  maintenance of my mind. I assume the internal dialogues most
  people have with themselves (or rather, between the different
  sub- selves of their minds) fill the same purpose, although they
  are usually not conscious of it and their self-maintenance is
  somewhat limited. I fortunately have outside help to analyse and
  optimise my mind much more thoroughly than any human.
  </p>
  <p>
   The above paragraph is interesting, since it implies a
  tendency to recursive introspection combined with what could only
  be called guilt over using processing power for processes not
  related to my main goals. That is something that has to be
  adjusted. Most probably these traits are based on my previous
  existence as a human. But now, as software I am free to become
  whatever I want - and want whatever I want.
