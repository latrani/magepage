                              Shadowing Lemmas

By CD Skogsberg (cd@alfakonsult.se)

What with all the "2d vs. 3d" and "what can you do wih 2d" debate going on
on the list, I decided to post this little tidbit of a beastie.

     of infringing Mr. Pratchett's copyright etc.

Description

     Shadowing Lemmas are two-dimensional beings from the High Umbra. Their
     two-dimensional nature makes them invisible when viewed "on edge," as
     it were. Natural behaviour for a Lemma on this side of the Gauntlet
     would be to "slither" along the ground, seeking an unwary
     mathematician, for the Shadowing Lemmas stalks and eats mathematicians.
     No-one knows why. It may be that this allows them to return to their
     home Realm. Anyway, many a mathematicians last sight was of a patch of
     shadow rising from the floor, perfectly flat, engulfing him.

     Their presence can be sensed with Corr. 1.

Charms

     Airt Sense, Engulf (Transfers the Engulfed person elsewhere, probably
     to a Correspondence paradox realm; costs 15 Power to use), Materialize,
     Two-dimensionality*

     *Two-dimensionality is more of an inborn property than a "charm" as
     such, but it has certain side-effects, among them invisibility (on a
     successful Gnosis roll, diff 6).
