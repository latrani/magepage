   These are paradox realms designed by the Nepharites, paradox
  beings who live on guilt and suffering. When a mage filled with
  guilt, fear, or pain suffers a paradox backlash, they will send
  him into a purgatorium, a realm designed to evoke more suffering
  for the enjoyment and nourishment for the nepharites. Normally
  these realms are purely mental, the mage seems to go into a deep
  sleep or coma and cannot awaken. What really happens is that the
  mage accidentally opens his mind to the Nepharites, who are given
  full control. In some special cases (like Spirit and
  Correspondence Paradox), they might enter a purgatorium bodily
  too, but it is rare.
   <p>
    A purgatorium may look like anything, but is often based on
  the surroundings of the mage when he suffered the backlash.
  Things are almost right, but small disturbing details abound or
  certain things are clearly horribly out of place (like having a
  torture chamber in the middle of a night-club or gallows with
  hanged people instead of streetlights on a street). The realm is
  completely controlled by the Nepharite, who can do
    <em>
     anything
    </em>
    inside. It can change how it looks, the way it
  works or what happens. It can turn the mage inside out with a
  gesture and keep him alive forever. However, nothing that happens
  inside the realm can have any effect on the outside (unless the
  mage believes in it strongly enough to create hobgoblins and
  Quiet making it nearly real). So the Nepharite may kill the mage
  again and again, but if the mage escapes he's unhurt.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Nepharite may determine if magick works or not, or how it
  works. It can turn all magick inside the Purgatorium around,
  controlling it completely (after all, its just illusions). It is
  possible to destroy the body of the Nepharite if it allows it,
  but it can of course reform anytime it wants. However, Nepharites
  love to give their victims hope and then destroy it. The
  Nepharite cannot really touch the Avatar of the victim, so the
  victim will still retain his countermagick and Arete, and purely
  internal magick (like Mind 1) can't be influenced. But the
  Nepharites are good at creating mental illusions, making their
  victims think they can't resist anything.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Nepharite seeks to evoke more guilt, fear and pain from
  the mage using any means possible. Plain torture is not the best
  way to do this, more subtle means are more rewarding. The
  Nepharite can make the mage meet old friends he has betrayed (or
  think he has betrayed), place him in the same situation again and
  again or create scenarios to provoke more negative emotions. The
  only way to escape a purgatorium is to realize what it is. If the
  mage stops being guilty or afraid, the Purgatorium will dissolve
  and he will escape. However, the Nepharite naturally tries to
  hinder this by adding extra problems when somebody seems to
  figure it out.
   </p>
   <p>
    Nepharites may be all-powerful inside their Purgatories, but
  outside they are just ordinary paradox spirits. Their powers
  vary, but most are adept at Mind, especially the creation of
  emotions, illusions and finding weaknesses of people. Some
  Nepharites are not content with simply dragging mages into their
  realms, but actively seek them out before they suffer any big
  backlash. They will try to increase their guilt and pain, and
  either make them do something that gives the Nepharite the chance
  to send them into its realm (just voluntarily opening your mind
  to it is generally enough), or manipulate them to spread more
  guilt, fear, and pain among others.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some Nepharites even tempt the mages with promises of power,
  pleasure or other things. If the mages accept, they are led into
  their Purgatories and given what they want. These Nepharites feed
  at first on the gluttony of their victims, and then on their pain
  when they can't get enough. As the mages become more dependent on
  the Nepharite, it can start to twist the mages. They have to do
  more and more to get what they want, and they become more and
  more debased in their pursuit. In the end they suffer horribly,
  only upheld by a hope that never will be fulfilled.
   </p>
   <p>
    Purgatories are not completely evil, some mages claim they
  even do good sometimes. By forcing the mage to overcome his
  self-imposed limitations, the Nepharites are forcing them to
  develop. There have been cases where the Avatar of the mage has
  appeared before them in the Purgatorium, turning it into an
  Epiphany. Some Nepharites might even be the Avatars of their own
  mages! But there is a dark side of the Purgatories too. Some
  mages fail completely, and become imprisoned forever (this
  happens also if the body is killed). In that case they become
  slaves to the Nepharite, who can do as it pleases to them. In
  some cases they have turned into Nepharites themselves, in other
  cases they have become snivelling slaves who do anything for the
  Nepharite to escape more punishment. Some mages have escaped from
  the Purgatories, but the lesson has turned them less human and
  more Nepharite themselves.

   <h2>
    Some Examples:
   </h2>
   <b>
    Example 1:
   </b>
   Hans Karlsson, a member
  of the Cult of Ecstasy, has just accidentally killed his close
  friend Peter, and tries to commit suicide by using some very
  vulgar magick. However, he botches and is sent into his
  purgatorium. The Nepharite makes it look like a Hell designed by
  Clive Barker, labyrinths of steel tunnels where people are
  gruesomely tortured by beings in leather. Freezing blood, sharp
  meathooks and rattling chains are everywhere. It also looks a bit
  like the place where Hans killed his friend, his own living room,
  so among the horrors there are also comfortable sofas, TVs
  showing gameshows and tables with snacks (which turn out to be
  horrible things when examined).
   <p>
    The Nepharite appears before him (looking like something awful
  which has escaped from the dissecting table. It is wearing a
  comfortable costume stained by blood) and welcomes him to Hell,
  his new home. "Before we start torturing you forever, you might
  want to meet your neighbors. Here is someone you know, I think.
  Peter, I think you have met Hans?" On a dissecting table Peter is
  strapped and several figures in stained surgical dresses are busy
  vivisecting him. Between his anguished screams he manages to
  shout to Hans: "You sent me here! You sent me here!"
   </p>
   <p>
    The Nepharite will start to torture Hans, but the torture is
  really just an extra touch. The real pain comes from having all
  his old friends and relatives appear to be imprisoned here, and
  most of them have appeared here due to his own actions. From time
  to time the Nepharite drops other friends and loved ones into the
  Purgatorium (naturally, nobody is real, but they appear real),
  adding fresh pain. Even better is having Hans try to escape and
  free his friends, because then he can make a mistake just when
  they are about to reach freedom, and then they will all be
  returned to Hell and he will feel more guilt about failing his
  friends.
   </p>
   <p>
    The only way he can escape is if he realizes that it's the
  guilt he feels for his friends and his actions which keep him
  imprisoned. If he just tries to escape without trying to save his
  friends or excuse himself to them, he will succeed. He will wake
  up from his coma.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Example 2:
    </b>
    Ylva Carlsson, a Virtual Adept, is being
  hunted through the dark streets of Stockholm by the Men in Black.
  She desperately tries to Vector away using her laptop, but she
  botches and she is sent into her purgatorium. What she sees is
  just how the laptop crashes, nothing else has changed. She is
  still hunted by the Technocracy, there are Men in Black behind
  her, she hears the bark of enhanced bloodhounds and somewhere
  above a helicopter searches for her with a searchlight. The
  purgatorium looks exactly like Stockholm, except that there is no
  help anywhere. There is no one on the streets, all doors are
  locked, all people are asleep, her laptop has crashed (truly
  traumatic for a VA) and her allies are gone. The night will
  continue indefinitely.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Nepharite, which doesn't appear visibly, directs the hunt
  after her. As soon as she finds a hiding place, the Men In Black
  find her after a few moments. However, she has always a chance of
  escape, so that she can be hunted even more. It tries to give the
  impression that the Technocracy will kill her outright if she as
  much as turns around (say by having them efficiently kill a few
  innocent bystanders who had the misfortune to see the hunt or use
  some nasty weapons she just avoid by sheer luck), since that is
  the only way she can escape. She must turn around and face what
  she fears, not flee it, to escape. Of course, if she does that,
  the Nepharite will make a last attempt to frighten her into
  fleeing, by letting her see the unstoppable might of the pursuing
  technomancers and the futility of resisting them. If she tries
  despite this, then the nepharite has lost its claim to her and
  she will awaken.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Example 3:
    </b>
    Karl Steen, member of the Order of Hermes,
  is seeking Ascension. He is obsessed with it, and tries to learn
  everything about it. At the same time he isolates himself more
  and more from other mages, who he (quite correctly) suspects
  wouldn't understand his theories. When he tries to perform a
  great ritual to summon his own Avatar, he naturally fails and
  suffers a severe Paradox Backlash.
   </p>
   <p>
    Before him, his Avatar stands (it is of course the Nepharite).
  It asks him what he wanted, and as he explains that he seeks
  enlightenment, it seems to be pleased. It says: "Come. If you can
  overcome the great dangers before you with your knowledge, will,
  intuition and power, you will gain it." If Karl hesitates, the
  Avatar will ask him if he really wants to reach enlightenment or
  if he is content to remain unenlightened. Quite naturally the
  mage will follow his Avatar on the quest.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Nepharite creates a gruelling quest for the mage, with no
  end. The mage is led through more and more hermetic adventures,
  where his skills are constantly tested. He knows that if he fails
  in any part, he will fail completely. He has to solve ancient
  mysteries, meet allegorical persons, travel dangerous and
  symbolical paths and so on (for some ideas, read "The Alchemical
  Wedding of Christian Rosencreutz") If the mage ever seems to tire
  or hesitate, the Avatar will remind him that perseverance and
  strength of will are essential parts of the seeking, and if he
  gives up, he will fail completely. If the mage wonders why the
  quest is so long and hard, the Avatar will explain that
  Enlightenment is never easy to reach.
   </p>
   <p>
    The only way for the mage to escape the quest is simply
  leaving it, returning to his normal life and abandoning his
  Avatar. He must overcome his obsession with success and his
  stubbornness, and suffer the pangs of insecurity as he turns his
  back on Enlightenment. That's the only way he can reach true
  Enlightenment.
