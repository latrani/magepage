   A Child is Born
  </h1>

  <p>
   The air was cold and clear as ice, sending cunning tendrils of
  wind into every nook and cranny. The traffic lights shifted above
  empty streets as the town slept beneath pinpoint stars.
  </p>
  <p>
   From the shadows beyond the buildings a dark man emerged and
  began to walk with precise steps towards the town centre. His
  shadow was a yawning gulf of darkness, seeking to devour all.
  Over his gaunt features played an ironic smile, as eyes darker
  than the Abyss surveyed the closed shops and trashcans. In the
  darkness beyond the light unseen things moved.
  </p>
  <p>
   A few blocks away a woman was walking towards the same
  destination. Her long black hair and white shirt fluttered in a
  warm wind that wasn't there, and her eyes sparkled with starlight
  from unknown constellations. Somewhere a dog began to howl and
  was answered by something from the forest beyond, making the dog
  quickly stop.
  </p>
  <p>
   Across the town a man strode towards the meeting with
  resolute, measured steps. His suit was impeccably dark and
  expensive, his glasses coldly reflected reality back on itself.
  Along him followed the whisper of the fiberoptical cables beneath
  the street, the quiet murmur of remote highways and the cold
  stare of orbital defence stations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The three reached the crossing at the same time from different
  directions. They warily eyed each other, and then turned to the
  fourth street.
  </p>
  <p>
   The man may not have been standing there a moment ago, but now
  he had been standing there since the town was built. He was
  surprisingly nondescript, as if all of his features were
  temporary things he made up as he went along and soon would
  forget. In one hand he held a bracelet shaped like a stylised
  MÃ¶bius strip, an infinity sign or a snake eating its tail.
  He smiled broadly at the other three.
  </p>
  <p>
   For a moment everything was still and in perfect balance. The
  four watched each other, standing completely still. The cogwheels
  of reality's hidden machinery meshed and something clicked in
  place. Tremendous forces balanced each other, held in check by
  the frailty of the symmetry of the situation, nothing more.
  </p>
  <p>
   Somewhere nearby chaos was trying to break the balance,
  prevented only by luck, skill and perhaps destiny. A few shots
  were heard and a scream from something inhuman. A ripple in
  reality was sealed with fire and logic. Then silence reigned.
  </p>
  <p>
   Each of the four considered the possibility of overturning the
  balance, to strike the first blow and get the advantage of
  surprise. They all came to the same conclusion at the same time.
  Neither of them spoke; they all knew what the others would say.
  The acknowledgement hung in the air: "So it begins/ends".
  Together they began to walk towards the brightly lit hospital, to
  the maternity ward.
  </p>
  <p>
   An ancient figure watched them from across the parking lot
  with an expression of hateful scorn on his wrinkled face. As the
  third man entered the hospital he looked back at the figure, who
  demonstratively turned his back on him.
  </p>
  <p>
   "I didn't know they could get angry" someone said in a low
  voice from the shadows. She was a nervous dark girl huddling in a
  far too thin jacket near a small portable radiator.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Actually, my dear, they usually can't. They are
  manifestations of static reality, not personalities. But in this
  case the causal strain is so great that he (and I assume others)
  have been forced to take on a more personal reality in order to
  fulfil their duties. Probably..."
  </p>
  <p>
   The speaker was a pale man in a bulky coat, with a big
  bear-skin hat that made him look slightly Russian. He was trying
  to make the reception on the small radio he held clearer, with no
  success.
  </p>
  <p>
   "What Hans says is that Mr. Anybody
   <i>
    forced
   </i>
   you-know-who
  to become personal. And he doesn't like it one bit."
  </p>
  <p>
   The third speaker was a plump lady, wearing sensibly warm
  clothing and a somewhat incongruous neon-coloured backpack. Her
  smile hinted at someone used to get her way, preferably in the
  least amount of multi syllable words.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Exactly, although I would hesitate to attribute
  anthropomorphic emotions to a manifestation of reality
  itself."
  </p>
  <p>
   "But why? Why can't he just fry Mr. Anybody for whatever he is
  doing? You know, they say he can make so that big offenders never
  get born. Never existed. But here reality is taking a beating
  worse than anything I have ever seen, even that dox storm in
  Miami. So why is he standing just there?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "While Mr. Anybody is up there visiting his birth? Yes, I
  would also wring my hands if I was in those wrinkly clothes. But
  he has no choice. Mr. Anybody is an Oracle, no doubt about it.
  And those other three were definitely Oracles too... did you feel
  how dark and cold it got as that dark one looked this way?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "It is certainly the Dark Man himself, and I think I have
  guessed who the lady is. Could the third be The Man those rastas
  mentioned? Mark my words, we are in a very select company
  tonight."
  </p>
  <p>
   The radio scratched, making everybody jump. A static-filled
  voice said: &lt;Taurus, this is Aquarius. Do you copy?&gt;
  </p>
  <p>
   "Taurus here, is everything allright?"
  </p>
  <p>
   &lt;Malacheem says something is approaching, it could
  be...&gt;. The message was drenched in a susurating distortion.
  The three quickly looked around, scanning the area for signs of
  intrusion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Suddenly everything began to soften. The air lost its cold,
  and became grainy and somehow translucent. Behind it, behind
  reality itself, something moved. It was brightly coloured, yet
  grey, bulging and somehow still thin and sharp as a knife. It
  scratched against reality, seeking to tear an opening.
  </p>
  <p>
   They jumped into action. Forming a circle they began to chant
  against it. It was no usual magick, seeking to change reality.
  This sought to keep it the same; a billowing chant about cause
  and effect, orderly time and space, stable matter and moving
  energy, forces balancing each other in dynamic equilibrium. They
  sensed the silent support by the ancient figure behind them,
  strengthening their Will.
  </p>
  <p>
   The thing threw itself at the thin shell separating it from
  normal reality sending out shockwaves of itching paradox, but it
  barely held. It turned itself inside out, revealing a cloud of
  reflecting planes that hammered against reality while heavy
  shapes flowed together. The mages threw their Will against it
  like a searing flame and the planes splintered into snowflakes of
  light retreating away from the fire. With a triumphant word the
  air cleared and the cold returned.
  </p>
  <p>
   The three breathed heavily, slowly relaxing from the attack.
  The ancient figure had not moved during the whole ordeal.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Holding off crazies that want to ruin the birthday party,
  "volunteered" by a certain gentleman... why can't he just decide
  they were never born? Would save everyone a lot of trouble and
  paradox."
  </p>
  <p>
   "They do not play according to the rules. He cannot touch
  them, and if they manage to sabotage this all the hell will break
  loose, I assume."
  </p>
  <p>
   "So we have to take care of his dirty work."
  </p>
  <p>
   "If Mr. Anybody is not born, then this exciting evening will
  never have occurred, creating a huge causal paradox. Most
  probably it would be enough to completely blow apart cause and
  effect over the span of several decades, involving at least four
  Oracles and definitely this whole area, perhaps all of reality.
  And by somehow bringing the other three here by their own free
  will and without any outside influence he has made sure he will
  be born."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Why?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Otherwise you-know-who could just remove him. But now their
  presence will cause something crucial to the child. So
   <i>
    they
   </i>
   are the real reason Mr. Anybody will be born. And
  they are too important to the grand scheme of things, I suppose,
  to be removed."
  </p>
  <p>
   Hans was far away. "Perhaps their existence even implies the
  rules... if The Man had never emerged, our "boss" would perhaps
  never have existed. And the Dark One... maybe they are just
  reciprocating for the births of
   <i>
    each other
   </i>
   ..."
  </p>
  <p>
   "It is foolish to speculate on could-have-beens and
  might-becomes". The voice was chilling, like age itself. Hans
  paled and whirled around to face the gnarled figure that now
  stood just behind them. "It has been done. The child is born, and
  he who you called Mr. Anybody has given it the bracelet. The
  circle is closed, and the case closed. Go home."
  </p>
  <p>
   Above the hospital an orbital platform glimmered among the
  cold stars. A child was born.
