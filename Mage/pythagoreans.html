   A sub-tradition by Anders Sandberg for Mage: the Ascension by
  White Wolf Games
  </h5>
  <hr>
   The Pythagoreans were a minor tradition during the classic Greek
  era, an offshoot of Greek philosophy and eastern ideas. It was
  founded by
   <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Pythagoras.html">
    Pythagoras
   </a>
   himself around 500 BC. Many stories have been told
  about him and his achievements. It is said that he could do
  almost anything; He competed and won prizes in the Olympic
  wrestling games only eighteen years old. He travelled to Egypt
  and Babylonia to learn the ancient wisdom of the priests. He
  could tame a bear or stop the eagle in the air with a few
  magickal words. He was a masterful musician and physician. When
  Polykrates became tyrant on his native Samos, Pythagoras left and
  moved to Crotone in southern Italy (this is a historical fact).
  Here he founded his school of philosophy and mysticism, and spent
  much time in thought in a cave, discovering the hidden truths of
  the universe and writing them down in small legends or laws.
   <p>
    The sect was strict, ascetic and centralised. Members swore an
  oath of silence and weren't allowed to say anything until they
  had listened to the teachings of the Master for five years. The
  authority of the Master was total, his word was not to be
  questioned in any way whatsoever (this is the source of the idiom
  "Iurare in verba magistri", "to swear on the word of the
  teacher"). All results were attributed to the sect or to the
  Master, not to their discoverers who remained anonymous. They
  were strict vegetarians, and were also prohibited from eating
  beans since they were thought to house the souls of the dead. The
  students were taught mathematics (mainly geometry, it's highest
  form), music, astronomy and magick.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Pythagoreans taught that the planets (including the
  invisible Anti-Earth on the other side of the Sun), the Moon and
  the Sun were fixed on great spheres of crystal, rotating around a
  central fire. Their motions creates the exquisite harmony of the
  spheres, which ordinary people cannot hear because they are too
  used to it. The Pythagoreans made no distinction between music,
  mathematics and magick. Music was found to be based upon subtle
  mathematical laws, and so was magick. Everything in the universe
  follows mathematical laws and is created out of the geometrical
  interactions of the numbers, which are the true basis of reality.
  Each number is holy and has its own powers. One is the
  indivisible monad, creating everything out of itself. Two is the
  pure duality, perfect balance between opposites. Three is the
  number of the gods, while four is the number of the material
  world (hence the four elements). And so on. This became the
  foundation of the numerology that the Order of Hermes
  adopted.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Pythagoreans believed in the eastern idea that the soul is
  divine and immortal, and that it does reincarnate after each
  death. It is imprisoned in our imperfect material bodies as a
  punishment. The goal for all rational people is to break free
  from this prison. The only way this can be achieved is by seeing
  and understanding the true reality.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the tradition of Greek philosophy, the Pythagoreans were
  more thinkers and mystics than practical mages. They regarded the
  external use of magick (or mathematics) as filthy, and avoided it
  at all costs. Instead they turned inwards, studying the secrets
  of the universe. They did not want to reveal anything to the
  unworthy people outside the group, preferring to keep silence on
  the great truth they knew.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Pythagoreans were mainly interested in the nature of space
  and geometry, having Correspondence as main sphere. However, they
  studied all of reality with equal zeal. Their interest was mainly
  theoretical and directed more towards understanding the world
  than influencing it. Most Pythagoreans learned many spheres, but
  often just to a basic level, enough to see the relevant aspect of
  reality, which they then began to study. To actually use a sphere
  to change reality was abhorrent to them. Instead they turned
  inwards, trying to perfect their understanding of the cosmic
  harmony. To focus their minds they used music (especially string
  instruments like harps and lutes), geometry and meditation.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Pythagoreans became influential in the politics of
  Crotone. Their asceticism contrasted strongly to the hedonism of
  the nearby city of Sybaris, which they fought and finally
  destroyed. They also strongly supported the aristocracy,
  regarding it as self-evident that a few competent people could
  run things better than the great masses. As the democratic
  movement won power in southern Italy in the 4th century BC, the
  Pythagoreans became persecuted. However, they persisted well into
  the 3rd century despite the persecutions and the dissolution of
  their rigid hierarchy.
   </p>
   <p>
    Their ideas were adopted by Plato and through him later
  influenced the Gnostics and the Order of Hermes (and the
  Technocracy to some extent). The sect were never forgotten, and
  small groups may have revived its ideas and practices at
  different times and places. Its ideas seem to have survived with
  a surprising tenacity.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Philosophy
   </h2>
   "Everything is created out of the whole
  numbers. From their ratios, differences and sums everything is
  made. The spheres are arranged by their immutable laws, rotating
  in eternal harmony. In the same way we can attain perfect harmony
  with the cosmos by opening our minds to the truth of numbers."
   <h2>
    Organisation
   </h2>
   The Pythagoreans were probably organised (or
  disorganised) like a normal Greek school of philosophy. In the
  centre was the Master, which everyone had to listen to and obey.
  Around him was a circle of trusted friends and students, which
  performed most of the teaching and training. The acolytes and new
  students had the least status, and were not permitted to speak.
   <h2>
    Meetings
   </h2>
   Whenever the Master called his students, or
  whenever there was a particular need. There was no special
  celebrations or feasts in the group.
   <h2>
    Initiation
   </h2>
   After spending five years listening to the
  teachings in total silence, the student was left in a cave to
  meditate. If he had understood the teachings correctly and had
  the right type of mind, he would then be able to hear the harmony
  of the spheres. If he succeeded, he was made a full member of the
  group, while if he failed he was thrown out or forced to remain
  silent for five more years.
   <h2>
    Chantry
   </h2>
   There were never any true chantry except for the
  meeting places of the group in Crotone. However, the caves and
  beaches nearby were often used for meditation, teaching and
  musical experiments best performed beyond the reach of the ears
  of mortals.

   . The Pythagoreans regarded
  geometry as the highest form of mathematics, and the field most
  worthy of study. The relations between points, lines, circles and
  other figures provided an endless source of mysteries to
  understand. However, they also strived to perfect their
  understanding of music and acoustics (using Time and Forces), the
  mental world and the world of spirits.

     To fully understand something, the Pythagoreans had to see
    how it related to the fundamental concepts creating everything,
    the numbers and geometrical objects. Everything they studied
    was carefully drawn and analysed. They generally made diagrams
    and constructions using ruler and compass in fine sand,
    sometimes engraving them in wax.

     By playing the harp or lute the pythagoreans could create
    vibrations showing the subtle properties of surrounding
    objects. It also gave them the ability to see how the
    vibrations they created interacted with the music of the
    spheres. Some music was harmonious with it, and enforced and
    healed. Other kinds of music was discordant and could hurt or
    cause dangerous effects. Quite understandably the pythagoreans
    took music seriously, and couldn't stand if it was played
    incorrectly or poorly.

   </h2>
   The Pythagoreans disliked using
  magick to influence reality, so they didn't approve of most rotes
  except passive methods to study the world. Only in desperate
  cases did they use their knowledge in any direct way. Another
  fact is that much of their magick today is coincidental or even
  considered to be science. Calculating sizes from a distance using
  trigonometry is no longer magick, it is mathematics.
   <h3>
    Measurement (Correspondence 1 Mind 1)
   </h3>
   By simply watching
  something in the distance and then perform a few simple
  calculations, a Pythagorean could easily count the number of
  objects, their distances and relations with each other.
   <h3>
    Absolute Tuning (Forces 1 Mind 1)
   </h3>
   By performing
  geometrical calculations while listening to the sound of an
  instrument, the pythagoreans could tune it perfectly, giving it
  almost unearthly perfect sound. This was reputed to be done by
  calculating how to tune the instrument in accordance with the
  harmony of the spheres. This could at least in theory be done to
  anything, causing it to resonate with the spheres.
   <h3>
    The Fall of Sybaris (Mind 2 Life 2)
   </h3>
   The enmity between
  the ascetic Pythagoreans in Crotone and the hedonistic Sybarites
  of Sybaris led to several wars. In the end the Pythagoreans won
  through psychology and cunning. The Sybaritic army was
  extravagantly dressed and equipped. The horses of the cavalry was
  trained to move to music for use in the many parades of Sybaris.
  The Pythagoreans simply let their musicians play a happy melody,
  which made the horses dance. With the cavalry out of the way, the
  Pythagoreans could easily capture Sybaris, which they destroyed
  totally.
   <h3>
    Cosmic Meditation (Correspondence 3 Mind 1 Entropy
  1)
   </h3>
   Pythagoras himself spent much time meditating on geometric
  problems, developing elaborate and subtle theories. By employing
  his knowledge of the harmony of the spheres in his work, he could
  guide himself to levels of greater understanding and eliminate
  the chance of making random errors. He could spend days watching
  how the pure geometrical relationships which made up the universe
  interacted, and extract deep insights from them.
   <p>
    [ The mage enters a deep intellectual trance, where he is one
  with the realm of mathematics and logic. He can see the universe
  from this point of view, see the deep mathematical relations
  making it up, without even moving from his place. ]
   </p>
   <h3>
    Cosmic Disharmony (Correspondence 4 Entropy 4 Prime
  2)
   </h3>
   This rote was probably never used, but remained a
  theoretical application of the magick of the Pythagoreans. By
  very carefully setting up a resonance using music and geometry
  with the spheres, a link could be formed between the universe and
  an object or person. By suddenly throwing the music into discord
  the harmonious link could turn into a most deadly force, as the
  forces of the universe rips the object (or person) apart and
  spreads it across all of creation in an instant.
   <p>
    [ The mage colocates the affected object to many places at
  once, ties it to them using Prime and then releases it. The
  resulting effect will rip it apart using the inertia of the whole
  universe. Each success will make 4 damage levels, and the victim
  will be spread out over the universe, leaving no trace
  behind.]
