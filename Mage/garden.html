   This realm is one of the most pleasant and beautiful realms any
  mage can ever visit. According to the myth, it was created by a
  long forgotten mage who wanted a place to rest and meditate.
  After his death, it remained and became home to the beings which
  are known as the Gardenkeepers. It still remains as a symbol of
  the beauty magick can create.
   <p>
    The Garden looks like a Japanese garden in spring. The cherry
  blossoms bloom, trees and bushes have just started to turn green.
  The air is cool and fresh, like just after a rain. The weather is
  generally beautiful, with elegant wisps of cloud on an azure sky.
  A slight breeze rustles the trees and make showers of pink
  blossoms to fall into the streams and dams of the garden. Old
  wooden bridges with ornamented railings cross them, often
  decorated with small figurines of vaguely oriental gods and
  heroes. Small paths lead to different places in the garden or
  just curve gracefully back to their origin.

    There is no edge of the garden, but it seems to be not too
  large. When walking through it, it never seems to repeat exactly,
  and the visitor seems to return almost to their starting point.
  Certain landmarks are constant, like the meditation pavilion, a
  small pavilion placed on a small island in a large dam where
  cranes move in the distance. Other places are the Shrine, a
  temple like building surrounded by high hedges, the Bridge of
  Mist, a bridge over a stream where thin streamers of mist flow
  over the water or the Stone, a large black rock surrounded by low
  benches.

    The reality of the garden has certain restrictions. Its axioms
  are about the same as normal reality, except that Mind is always
  coincidental. However, doing anything that disturbs the beauty
  and order of the garden will incur paradox. This range from
  breaking a flower just for fun or carving initials into benches
  to vulgar magick which doesn't fit in, like changing the weather
  or turning plants into something else. All such things will incur
  more paradox, even if they normally are coincidental or even
  natural. It also attracts the gardenkeepers.
   </p>

    The Gardenkeepers protect the garden. Normally they are never
  seen, or just seen in the distance, tending to the garden. They
  look like vaguely oriental figures, with simple yet tasteful
  clothes and meditative, gracious movements. They keep everything
  in shape, discreetly removing fallen branches and leaves and
  generally keeping an eye on everything without being seen.
  However, if the visitors disturb the garden they will discreetly
  approach and very politely suggest they leave. If this is not
  done, they will try to remove the intruders. They have reality on
  their side, and will respond to any threat with beautiful,
  elegant killing precision. Like everything else in the garden,
  even defeat is choreographed into an elegant piece of art.

    The Garden can be reached by travel through the Umbra, but it
  can also be reached by Quiet. Many Akashic Brothers who have
  become lost in meditation slowly wander into the Garden with
  their minds. There they remain in peaceful meditation or walk
  around pleasantly. One interesting feature of the garden is that
  most visitors never meet or even notice each other, the Garden
  seems always to be almost empty.
