More Time Rotes 

Here are some more Time Rotes, especially rotes involved in healing or 
avoiding damage.


Instant Reaction (Time 1 Mind 1)

When the mage expects a certain event, he can focus his attention on it to
be able to respond reflexively at the same time. For example, if a thug
threatens him with a gun, he can program his body to dodge at the exact
moment the thug pulls the trigger or respond with magick. A stand-off
between two mages both using this rote can be quite deadly, since they
will both react at the exact same time. 

[ If the rote succeeds the mage will act just before the event, as long as
the condition predates it slightly (like the act of pulling a trigger).
The number of successes denotes how long the mage can concentrate himself.
He has to be completely concentrated on the condition to act, and cannot
do anything else (unless he uses multitasking, of course).]


No-Time (Time 1 Entropy 2 Mind 1/3)

This bizarre rote removes the sense of time from the subject or the mage.
It becomes impossible to plan for the future or remember the past, all
that exists is an eternal now. By combining this with entropy it becomes
impossible to predict what the subject will do, even with Time. The Cult
of Ecstasy usually invoke this by extreme intoxication, loud music and
then by placing the ring on a finger; as long as it remains, the rote will
be active. 


Sounds of Pain (Time 2 Life 1)

This little rote allows a mage to mentally hear the sounds of whatever
caused a wound. Some truly twisted cultists have used it to play music on
sick people. 

[Adding Forces 3 Prime 2 the sounds can be made audible]. 


Prophylactic (Time 2 Life 3/4)

Some mages know they are going to get hurt in the future, and take steps
to limit the damage. By reaching into the potential futures and choosing
one where the damage isn¹t that bad, they can avoid the worst
possibilities. This is usually coincidental; a wound turns out to be much
less severe than expected or a weapon just makes a glancing blow. The rote
will just protect against the next wound.  Among the Cult of Ecstasy, this
rote is usually done by dressing imagined wounds, followed by a period of
intoxication where the mage removes the bandages happily proclaiming ²It
doesn¹t look that bad!². 


Enhanced Regeneration (Time 3 Life 2)

Time mages are able to selectively speed up the healing and regenerative
abilities of an organism, making it recuperate much faster. This is very
useful, although it is often accompanied with hunger and extreme
itchiness. The Sons of Ether apply electricity in precisely calculated
patterns to the wounds, while the Cult of Ecstasy gives the patient such a
good time they forget about being hurt. 

[One success halves the healing time, two successes divide it with three,
three with four, etc. ]
