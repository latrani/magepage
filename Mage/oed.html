   Order of the Eternal Dawn, OED, was founded in the beginning of
  this century when several magi of Euthanatos and Verbena to their
  surprise found out that they had similar goals. They both worked
  on purifying the race, albeit in quite different ways. The
  involved Euthanatos had been working on the Messiah project for
  centuries, trying to weed out the weak and encouraging the useful
  traits in mankind. The Verbenas had tried to purify "the blood",
  and had done the same thing for a long time, by increasing the
  fertility in some persons, while decreasing it in others. They
  decided to join forces in secrecy, knowing their respective
  traditions would not like their alliance.
   <p>
    The first decades of OED's existence was spent quarrelling.
  Even if their goals and many methods were similar, the two
  traditions had much trouble co-operating. After some diplomatic
  German mages from Order of Hermes joined them, the tensions eased
  a bit. They set to work on purifying the race. Their first
  "experiment" was the Nazis. Using the semi-Masonic lodge Thule
  Gesellschaft to influence them, they tried to spread their ideas
  and take control over the emerging Nazi party. It turned out that
  they were not quite as easily manipulated as the mages believed,
  and several members got too carried away. The "experiment" didn't
  work at all, the Nazis corrupted the ideas of OED and used them
  in their own way.
   </p>
   <p>
    After the war, OED tried to salvage what it could. The
  remaining members were quite convinced that their ideas were
  right, but that they must be realized in a less spectacular way.
  Since the opinion now was firmly against any ideas of racial
  purity, they had to work in secrecy. Their next step was a long
  range plan to slowly breed a new race without anybody noticing.
  They set to work, as determined as ever.
   </p>
   <p>
    OED consists of members of Euthanatos, Verbena and a few
  Hermetic mages. Their number is very small, probably around 20.
  While they have left their own traditions (who would want to
  crush OED if they knew their existence), they have not created
  any new tradition. The mages use more or less the same philosophy
  and methods as their original traditions. Some members try to mix
  methods, with equally mixed success. To join OED, a mage must be
  invited by several members. Only mages who they are certain share
  their devotion to their ideals are considered. OED works in
  absolute secrecy.
   </p>
   <p>
    In their pursuit of a new race, OED cooperates with other
  groups in secret. There have been contacts between the
  Progenitors and members of OED (some members may even be
  Progenitors in incognito). Another group they have had much
  contact with is the Priory of Sion, a secret order devoted to the
  protection of the royal blood of the lineage Plantagnet (which
  they claim is descended from Christ. Read "The Holy Blood and the
  Holy Grail" for more theories about them). Other groups involve
  Teutonic ice and fire mages, neonazis and some Sons of Ether.
  Every contact have been extremely secret, and is almost
  impossible to trace back to OED.
   </p>
   <p>
    OED have several current projects. The most important is their
  breeding program. Using their magick, mundane methods and
  research they try to breed the new race. They try to discreetly
  manipulate persons with useful traits to mate, keep a watchful
  eye over families with "good blood" and constantly search for
  other lineages with desirable properties. (Think of the Bene
  Gesserit in the Dune books).
   </p>
   <p>
    Another area of research is Orphans. OED find them highly
  interesting. Why do they awaken? What keeps some of them from
  going insane while others quickly go mad? What factors influence
  them, both hereditary and environmentally? They try to find out,
  sometimes interviewing orphans or simply engaging in
  conversations. They also study the families of Orphans, hoping to
  find useful traits.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Euthantei in OED also weed out undesirable traits. They
  usually use dupes, which do the dirty work. Some mages work in
  hospitals, where they in secret decide who is useful and who is
  not. Some of them have begun infiltrating sperm-banks, swapping
  useless material for what they consider useful.
   </p>
   <p>
    Other projects involve training and imprinting of the
  protected families and their children, political and scientific
  infiltration to make their views a bit more PC again and pure
  magickal research on just what traits are useful, and what the
  new race will become. They have done some experiments studying
  garou lineages and the effects of kindred blood, but so far they
  have not proven useful to them.
   </p>
   <p>
    OED have secret meeting places. One of the most typical is an
  office belonging to "Good Life Insurance" in New York. The
  insurance company is quite real, and controlled by one member.
  The office is used to store their secret documents, plans and
  results using several subtle magickal defenses. A sleeper viewing
  the documents would think they are normal accounting of no
  interest. Coincidental effects prevent them from being stolen. An
  anti-magickal shield strengthens the Gauntlet and dampens all
  magick. Here the East Coast OED meet, to discuss their latest
  findings and plans.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Follow Blood (Life 1 Time 2):
    </b>
    <br>
     The mage touches some blood from someone. The result is that the
  mage gains physiological knowledge about the owner, his age,
  condition, appearance, sicknesses, markings and so on. By tracing
  the blood backwards, the mage can learn how the owner was when he
  was younger. The mage may also continue the tracing back to the
  owners parents, and their parents, and so on. A single trait may
  be followed back to its source.
    </br>
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     End Blood (Life 4):
    </b>
    <br>
     The mage touches the victim with some blood (very little is
  required). The result is a small infection rendering the victim
  sterile and unable to pass on undesirable traits. The victim will
  not notice anything.
    </br>
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Guardian Angel (Spirit 2):
    </b>
    <br>
     The mage summons a protective spirit, which will follow a person
  around. If the person is in danger, is victim to magick or
  otherwise disturbed the spirit will alert the summoner. This rote
  is often used to protect desirable families.
    </br>
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Find Template (Life 1 Correspondence 3):
    </b>
    <br>
     The mage searches for life matching a template (like a cell
  sample, having a certain mark or a desirable trait). If there are
  any matching life forms, the mage will know where they are. This
  is used by some members to track their protected families.
    </br>
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Mark the Blood (Life 2 Prime 2):
    </b>
    <br>
     The mage "marks" the blood of a person. This marking will be
  passed on to the children, and so on. Sometimes this marking is
  bound to a special trait. The mark can be read by Life 1.
  Different markings have different meanings, and are used to keep
  track of certain traits. OED have also found that there exist
  other markings in several bloodlines, which they have not put
  there. Some members believe that there must have been other mages
  doing the same thing as they in the past. Other explain it away
  as a "lusus naturae", a strange but useless natural
  phenomenon.
