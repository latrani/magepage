   The Seekers of the Void are one of the most insidious and subtle
  groups of Nephandi undermining reality. Their goal is simply to
  end all of existence, to annihilate everything that exists and
  have ever existed.
   <p>
    Existence is pain. The Seekers seek to end all pain and
  suffering by achieving union with the eternal Void, the state of
  perfect nothingness where nothing exists or changes. All living
  beings suffer, but most hide it under a veneer of transient
  pleasures and even think themselves happy. Death offers no
  relief, since everything is reincarnated and forced to suffer
  again. There is no simple way to escape from existence. Since its
  a closed system, entropy is slowly overtaking everything, moving
  it towards a state of eternal stasis where nothing will ever
  change and nothing will be able to escape. The other mages seek
  to bring about their visions of perfection, essentially locking
  reality into a pattern they like for eternity, also denying
  everyone release from suffering.
   </p>
   <p>
    To extinguish something completely, its not enough to destroy
  it, since it will be reincarnated into something else and
  continue to suffer, and its Quintessence will spread to form new
  patterns of pain. At most destruction can save someone from a
  particularly painful existence. To destroy something truly, its
  necessary to actually remove its Quintessence from reality
  altogether. According to most mages, this is completely
  impossible. The Seekers believe that it is possible, and have the
  methods to achieve it. They do this by channelling Quintessence
  into the Void, letting its total nothingness extinguish the faint
  sparks of existence. Other mages claim they just spread out the
  Quintessence into the farthest reaches of the Deep Umbra, not
  actually destroying it.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Seekers are very discreet mages, doing their best to be
  left alone to their mission. They don't worship the Void, since
  it cares nothing about sacrifices or prayers. Instead they try to
  get as close they can to It while living, and to dissolve in it
  when they die. They have developed a form of the Good Death which
  hopefully will send the soul of the victim into the Void or at
  least as close as possible. They usually administer this to their
  own, but also tries to help others if they can. However, this is
  of subordinate importance to their great work and often draws
  unwanted attention to their activities.
   </p>
   <p>
    Their Great Work consists of undermining reality as much as
  possible, to let its existence slowly leak down into the Void.
  This is a very hard project, but the Seekers are dedicated and
  extremely patient. Their main method is to gather information and
  plan for a long time, and then suddenly make a surgical strike at
  weak points in reality. They dislike unnecessary fuss and often
  do their best to avoid hurting people. As targets they usually
  seek out nodes and other significant places. They try to open
  wells down into the Void, to make the Quintessence leak out.
  Other targets are more subtle, like certain places and times
  which seems to have importance to the Seekers but appear
  completely random to everyone else. In the long run they try to
  create as many leaks and instabilities in reality as possible,
  hoping to bleed away the Quintessence. Hopefully, existence will
  slowly fade away and give place for blessed Oblivion.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Seekers avoid worldly things as much as possible, and
  usually live ascetic lives. They spend much time meditating,
  freeing their minds from irrelevant thoughts and seeking the
  Void. Most prefer simple clothing, often in pure black or white.
  Many shave their heads like monks. In general, they surround
  themselves with austerity and as little as possible. Their
  meeting-places are often huge rooms, where the Void is implied by
  the emptiness.
   </p>
   <p>
    Although the Traditions, the Technocracy and sometimes other
  Nephandi has fought them at many different times and places, the
  Seekers of the Void are not very well known. They have a tendency
  to just slip away, or hide their views behind the views of other
  traditions which makes them hard to trace. They have from time to
  time infiltrated other Traditions and different chantries and
  subtly spread their ideas. They continue to do this to this day,
  often posing as Orphans, Euthanatos or Akashic Brothers. While
  many of the more experienced or enlightened mages can see the
  hidden dangers in their teachings, many of the younger and more
  inexperienced mages risk getting trapped.
   </p>
   <p>
    When attacked, the Seekers are almost always defensive. They
  usually just try to escape their attackers. If they cannot escape
  they calmly accept their fate, and turn inward hoping to reach
  the Void if they are killed. In some cases, the Seekers suddenly
  strike back if they see a chance to seriously weaken the
  opposition. However, in most cases they just calmly try to
  explain themselves to their enemies and make them understand the
  truth. In fact, attackers might find themselves confronted with
  an invitation to tea and rice-cookies.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Philosophy:
   </h2>
   "Buddha said: 'Everything is transitory'. The
  only truly eternal state is Nirvana, which is not only the total
  emptiness and perfection of the mind, but also of the whole of
  existence. We seek this blessed Void, and want to help everyone
  who seeks release to eventually reach it."
   <h2>
    Initiation:
   </h2>
   The Seekers recruit their members from those
  who have truly understood the pain of existence, and seek to end
  it. Those not judged fit to join the Seekers are usually given
  the Good Death out of mercy (this is often camouflaged as a
  suicides). The recruits are frequently given a vision of the
  eternal Void, where existence itself dissolves and nothing
  remains. Some choose to loose themselves in It, while others
  return as mages to help the rest of existence. They also recruit
  members from other Traditions, mainly the Euthanatos and Akashic
  Brothers, but this is rare.
   <p>
    <b>
     Acolytes:
    </b>
    Buddhists, Mystics, Seekers of purity
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Concepts:
    </b>
    Monk, Philosopher, Cultist
   </p>
   <h2>
    Meetings:
   </h2>
   All days are equally holy, or profane, from the
  Seeker point of view. They rarely gather together, preferring to
  seek the Void in meditation. Respected members sometimes attract
  groups of students, who gather to hear their teachings when they
  judge it proper to speak.
   <h2>
    Organization:
   </h2>
   The Seekers have no central organization,
  instead they group together in autonomous cabals which act
  independently and with no knowledge of each other. The cabals are
  usually fairly democratic, often ruled by consensus.
   <h2>
    Chantries:
   </h2>
   Many Seeker cabals lack permanent chantries,
  preferring to remain mobile. The Seekers who take up permanent
  residence seldom build anything which could be called labyrinths,
  their chantries look quite ordinary even on the inside. Most are
  very hard to tell from austere apartments or empty warehouses.
  However, the feeling of emptiness and silence is often
  oppressive, and everything seem dampened.
   <p>
    There are rumors of bigger chantries in the Deep Umbra, where
  the greatest Seekers guide the younger cabals and develop new
  ways to end existence. One of these chantries is rumored to be
  located in the City of Pyramids, on the edge of the Abyss.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Sphere:
   </h2>
   The Seekers specialize in Prime, the manipulation
  of Existence. They also place great importance in Entropy and
  Spirit, while most other spheres at most are regarded as tools or
  irrelevant. They mainly use Spirit to travel into the Umbra and
  open portals towards the Void, not to summon spirits. In fact,
  the Seekers regard most spirits as fairly unpredictable and too
  selfish to be of any use. Entropy is used to disperse things and
  end their current existence.
   <h2>
    Stereotypes:
   </h2>
   <b>
    The Technocracy:
   </b>
   They desperately try
  to build barriers against the unknown and any change, to lock us
  all within their dead world. This is mainly irrelevant, since
  they just manipulate things within existence. If they build a
  wall, we circumvent it or work from both sides. Their
  single-minded fear of the unknown makes them vulnerable to the
  emptiness.
   <p>
    <em>
     As Nephandi go, these are fairly benign. Their passivity
  makes them hard to find, but they are easy to terminate.
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     The Traditions:
    </b>
    Just like the Technocracy too involved
  in petty games of reality manipulation. What is important is not
  Reality, but non-Reality. However, due to their fragmented nature
  and more flexible way of thinking, they can accept our views much
  better.
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     The Seekers are among the most dangerous of all enemies of
  Ascension! They will not fight you, but snare you in reasonable
  explanations and philosophy until they have turned you into one
  of them.
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     The Marauders:
    </b>
    They seek to play their games of
  existence, not caring about the pain and suffering they cause.
  They are truly inhuman.
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     Booooring!
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     The other Nephandi:
    </b>
    Many of them serve beings from the
  Great Unknown, fighting in the idiotic war about reality. A few
  others have understood, even a few of the beings, and support us.
  But be careful, their alienness is dangerous and prevents them
  from seeing that the Void should be sought out of mercy, not
  hate.
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     They deserve the silence they seek.
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     The Wraiths:
    </b>
    Some of the dead get trapped in a state
  between life and death, not daring to go further, unable to
  return to life. Its our duty to help these unfortunate souls to
  find their way into the Void.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Foci:
   </h2>
   Some members are recruits from other traditions,
  and thus use their own foci, others use the following:
   <p class="c1">
    Meditation: Prime, Time, Correspondence, Spirit,
  Mind
   </p>
   <p>
    When seeking to influence existence, the Seekers empty their
  minds and become one with the Void. They see that time and
  distances are all illusions overlaying the truth of the Void, and
  see the world clearly. To reach this inner state, they have to
  meditate at least for a while.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Entropy: Litany
   </p>
   <p>
    The endless pain and misery of the world cannot be described,
  but by focusing their minds on chanting the litanies of truth and
  torment the Seekers are able to mesh with the flow of events. By
  chanting how things change or remain the same, how they decay and
  reform, they can control them.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Silence: Forces, Life, Matter
   </p>
   <p>
    The material world hides the Void and wraps the mage in its
  vain chaos. By remaining calm and silent in front of it, he can
  deny it existence or form it anew.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Quote:
    </b>
    "Existence is the Great Mistake."
   </p>
   <h2>
    Rotes:
   </h2>
   <b>
    See the Pillars of Pain (Prime 1 Entropy
  1):
   </b>
   The Seekers are constantly on the lookout for things,
  places or people who are of vital importance to existence in
  order to destroy or sabotage them. These pillars can be almost
  anything, ranging from nodes to certain housewives or a hallway
  in a museum. If they are truly destroyed, a little bit of the
  stability of existence is lost forever. Some Seekers spend much
  of their time looking for these pillars, often using
  Correspondence to locate them from afar and Time to find the
  exact right moment to strike.
   <p>
    <b>
     Scatter the Dust (Prime 4 Spirit 2 Entropy 2):
    </b>
    Although
  at this level of Prime the mage is not skilled enough to totally
  remove Quintessence, he can use this rote to scatter it over the
  whole of existence. The mage releases the Quintessence, and
  briefly meditates upon how it is evenly spread throughout the
  world.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Open the Void (Spirit 4 Prime 4):
    </b>
    This opens up a well
  into the Void, or at least the Deepest Umbra. It literally
  destroys reality, opening a yawning Void in its place. It is
  commonly performed by silent meditation, often by a whole group
  of Seekers in a circle. Inside the circle reality dissolves and
  opens up into a Void. Around the Void reality flows and changes
  in unpleasant ways, sometimes spontaneously rupturing further.
  Everything that enters the Void dissolves into nothingness.
   </p>
   <p>
    [The mage must break through the gauntlet (like Breach the
  Gauntlet) to create a true, somewhat stable Void. Otherwise it
  will just become a major Paradox warp instead. Anything inside
  the Void will dissolve into nothingness at a frightening rate
  (twice the number of successes per turn). To heal an expanding
  Void, the spirit rote "Sustain Existence" has to be used.]
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     End (Prime 5):
    </b>
    This rote is the central secret of the
  Seekers. It can dissolve any pattern and makes the Quintessence
  forming it vanish totally. The destroyed object is impossible to
  retrieve, even using Time magick.
   </p>
   <p>
    [Whether the Quintessence is totally destroyed or just
  channelled into a totally inaccessible state is unknown. The
  Seekers know what they think.]
