Subject: A couple of Talismans
To: nv91-asa@nada.kth.se

I have recently come up with two new Talismans you might want to put on 
your Mage page.

Temporal Taper  Arete 3 Quintessence 15
A Virtual Adept who got really tired of waiting a week for the next 
episode of Babylon 5 came up with this Talisman.  Using a Time 2 
effect, it reaches ahead in time to the time of a show that has not yet 
aired.  It then uses Forces to pick up the broadcast signal, 
transcribing it onto a ordinary video tape.  The result is that you can 
watch a show before it actually comes on.  It can also pick up shows 
that have already aired, by reaching back in time instead of ahead.

The Infinite Trunk  Arete 5 Quintessence 25
Ever have one of those days when you just couldn't fit everything you 
wanted to into your car trunk?  A group of Cult of Ectasy mages did one 
day when they couldn't get all their band equipment to fit in.  So, 
they created this Talisman to avoid such errors in the future.  It is 
an ordinary 1989 Acura Legend, with the exception of the trunk.  The 
trunk has been modified with a Correspondence 5 effect to be far larger 
on the inside than on the outside.  Note, though, that reaching far 
enough down to get what you put in out can be a problem.
