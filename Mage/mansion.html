   <hr>
    San Francisco has long been considered a free-wheeling, partying
  sort of town, second only to New Orleans and possibly Las Vegas
  in this regard. Coupled with being the center of the gay culture
  in the Western Hemisphere and possibly the world, as well as
  being a central point for the drug trade with the Pacific Rim, it
  is inevitable that somewhere along the line the Cult of Ecstacy
  got involved in the region.
    <h2>
     History
    </h2>
    The Scarlet Mansion was founded in 1812 by a rich
  young British businessman, Donald Sandforth, with connections in
  the opium trade from the Golden Triangle, and several connections
  with the Cult of Ecstacy. Originally just a home, it was only a
  matter of time before it also became part of the business of
  dealing in vice, in this case prostitution.
    <p>
     Reknowned and reviled throughout the West, and known as far
  off as New York, London, and Paris, by 1875 the Mansion was a
  popular destination for those who could pay the price.
  Businessmen, politicians, generals and drug lords all spent some
  time in the original Den of Iniquity. By this time, Sandforth had
  left this house to Moira O'Shea, a firey redhead wench he had
  "acquired" from a competitor back in Ireland, who had proven
  herself an effective administrator and Headmistress.
    </p>
    <p>
     Moira was also Awakened only three years before her assumption
  of ownership of the Mansion, and inducted into the Cult of
  Ecstacy. Her vices and tastes were considered by some to be
  extreme at the time, and under her leadership one of the main
  basement rooms, once used for "group frolics," as she facetiously
  termed them, was converted into a "dungeon," a playspace to
  satiate the dark, ssadistic and masochistic urges of some of the
  more rarified clientelle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Moira and the reputation of the Mansion grew, until one
  fateful day in 1907, when it all came tumbling down, quite
  literally. Of the people in the Mansion on the day of the quake,
  only Moira and two of her apprentices survived. Fearing ruin, she
  began working to rebuild the Mansion, hoping to return it to the
  glory days when she held one of the most influential positions in
  the New World.
    </p>
    <p>
     As it happens, her fame had travelled far. An Ancestral
  Chantry of the Cult of Ecstacy in Marseilles had forseen the
  darkness of the coming wars, and were looking for a new home.
  Seeing this as a golden opportunity, they offered to assist Moira
  in rebuilding the Mansion, with one price: That they be allowed
  to relocate their Chantry to San Francisco. She would, of course,
  be retained as Headmistress and would be a full member of the
  Chantry. Desperate, she agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Within two years the Scarlet Mansion had been rebuilt, even
  more splendorous than before. The entire building had been
  expanded, to become an opulent center of the most jaded desires.
  Everything from loud, raucous music to drugs to sex were
  practiced in generous amounts here, though the neighbors had no
  ideas, given the extensive planning put into the layout and
  design of the place.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Mansion quickly attracted the attention of the Chantry of
  the Gold Coast, and quickly struck an uneasy truce. The quiet
  front was really a fascade, however, as the two struggled for
  dominion over the lands by the Bay. It became obvious that the
  mages of the Scarlet Mansion would control San Franciscso, though
  the Chantry of the Gold Coast fought them at every turn.
    </p>
    <p>
     The 1940s brought an increased power and influence to San
  Francisco, and after the end of World War II, the mages of the
  Scarlet Mansion began a wild plan they thought would totally
  subvert the paradigm of the Technocracy. Over the next twenty
  years, they worked on their plan, and in the early 1960s, they
  unleashed it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Beginning with an assault on the restrictive, traditional
  cultural mores, they began reinforcing the revolutionary ideas of
  the 1960s with their own magic, slowly pushing the paradigm.
  Several of the bands and leadfers of the time, at least on the
  West Coast, though some back east as well, were either members of
  the Chantry (or contained members), or were closely manipulated
  by a member of the Chantry.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Chantry of the Gold Coast, seeing the paradigm push that
  was going on, decided to work on manipulating the paradigm in
  their own way, with the large Dreamspeaker and Order of Hermes
  components of that Chantry beginning to introduce a "new"
  spirutality, linking in a new spiritual value set in with the
  "free love" movement of the Scarlet Mansion magi.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then the two decided the views were incompatible, and began to
  push their message harder, faster than the paradigm would bend.
  Siezing the opportunity, the Technocracy pretty much dissolved
  most of the influence of the two chantries within a few years,
  though their mark was left on the dominant paradigm.
    </p>
    <p>
     Having tasted victory, only to be driven back through their
  own overzealousness, the two Chantries agreed to a full and
  lasting truce, and a pact of cooperation. Since then, with their
  increasing focus on the media and on slowly influencing the
  paradigm, they have achieved some remarkable successes, though
  nothing near the speed they had moved in the 1960s.
    </p>
    <p>
     Recently they have come across some difficulties posed by an
  odd coalition of Celestial Choristers and Technocrats, who have
  been attempting to close the Scarlet Mansion and imprison its
  owners and operators for "moral impropriety." So far they have
  successfully fought off these attempts, though they are becoming
  increasingly more difficult to defend against.
    </p>
    <h2>
     The Chantryhouse
    </h2>
    The Scarlet Mansion sits on over an acre
  on the seaward side of the San Francisco ridge. The grounds are
  manicured, with high bushes sculpted into topiaries and an
  elaborate hedge maze. Closer to the mansion proper, and in the
  back, the topiary becomes more suggestive, with erotic statuary
  placed in various locations.
    <p>
     The mansion itself is a huge affair, done in a Victorian
  style, with great columns and red brick, iron exterior light
  fixtures and cobblestone paths. The interior is all mahagony,
  teak, and ebony, kept polished to perfection (with aging slowed
  using a coincidental Time effect).
    </p>
    <p>
     The Mansion has three stories above-ground, and the same
  below. On the top floor are the living quarters for the Chantry
  members, at least those who choose to live in the mansion itself,
  as well as offices for the major Chantry officials. The second
  aboveground story is for the clients of the prostitutes employed
  by the Scarlet Mansion. The main floor consists of the offices of
  Bay City Escorts, a male and female escort service providing to
  clients of both genders and all sexual persuasions. The rest of
  the main floor is devoted to a small museum and art gallery,
  focussing on the less mainstream works that concern sexual
  expression.
    </p>
    <p>
     The lower floors take on a much different character. On the
  first lower floor are several places for engaging in more
  "deviant" sexual explorations, too numerous (and possibly
  disturbing) to name here. The basement below this contains mostly
  storage areas, and the drug den, which is actually linked by
  Correspondence (and carefully hidden) to a house in the
  Tenderloin district. The lowest floor is the center of the
  Mansion's drug processing and trading facilities, where many of
  the final procudts are manufactured nd then distributed, via a
  tunnel that connects to a secluded launch in Pacifica.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Mundane Attachments
    </h2>
    When they began trafficking in
  moonshine in the 1920s, the members of the Mansion quickly
  realized that they were going to need a way to get goods in and
  out without having to go near the busy port of San Francisco, and
  the easilly patrolled Golden Gate. Discovering an old tidal cave
  hidden underwater at high tide off the coast of Pacifica, they
  had their answer. They would bring boats in during low tide into
  a large chamber behind the cliff face, which they had expanded so
  it did not totally backfill with water at high tide, load the
  boats via a long connecting tunnel, and then ship them out the
  next low tide. This mechanism has worked well for them for over
  80 years now, and shows no sign of changing anytime soon.
    <p>
     The drug den in the Tenderloin is another story. About twenty
  years ago, a young mage at the Mansion had the idea of using
  Corespondence tomake an "unbustable" drug den. When clients would
  show up at the door, they would be scanned using a Mind effect to
  see if they were law enforcement or clients. Clients would then
  activate the Correspondence efefct, which to all intents and
  purposes would link them to a single large room in the basement
  of the Mansion itself, though sealed off by a hidden door behind
  the wallpaper of the "house" from the rest of the Mansion. Law
  enforcement and simple non-clients would find themselves in a
  run-down, shabby looking room with no drug users, and no signs of
  drug use (or habitation for that matter). This rote has proved
  remarkably successful, and there has been discussion of using it
  in a house in Oakland as well, though some are worried about the
  potential danger of discovery in establishing a new house.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Internal Structure
    </h2>
    The internal structure of the Scarlet
  Mansion Chantry is much like one would expect of any organized
  business. Major operations and long term decisions,as well as
  critical ones, are made by the Chantrymaster and his Adjunct.
  Issues of security are directed to the Warder, while the General
  Secretary deals with the outside world, handling most of the
  mundane aspects of the Chantry itself. The only oddity is the
  Image Consultant, a rather tongue-in-cheek reference to the head
  in charge of paradigm engineering, who is the most adept at
  manipulating the media and therefore the general paradigm.
    <p>
     The chantry membership is exclusively Cultists of Ecstacy,
  though there are a few Virtual Adepts who do freelance work for
  the Chantry for a price. Within the cultists, however, there are
  four factions:
    </p>
    <h3>
     The Godfathers/mothers
    </h3>
    This group is mostly interested in
  focusing on the drug trade, and in maximizing profit. Many of
  these are either very old or very young members of the Cult,
  brought in either during the days of prohibition or recently off
  thr streets. They are considered by much of the leadership to be
  a disgrace to the Chantry, and covert moves are made to reduce
  the influence this group has on Chantry operations.
    <h3>
     The Traditionalists
    </h3>
    This group believes that this chantry
  hastoo much history, and dignity, to be in a city as young as San
  Francisco. This group opposed the move from Marseilles, and some
  even believe that the Chantry would be better off moving to their
  old home in Istanbul. They oppose much of the new approach to
  fighting the Technocracy, though they will grugingly admit to the
  near success of the efforts during the 1960s.
    <h3>
     The Hedonists
    </h3>
    Every branch of the Cult of Ecstacy has
  these folk, those who have gotten too lost in the practice of
  vice to remember their true path or goal. Unfortunately, the
  number of these is on the rise, mostly a function of a depression
  caused by the apparent impossibility of fighting the Technocracy
  successfully (qv harano, W:tA). Almost like Quiet, this group is
  another embarassment to the Cult, though these are more easilly
  reformed than the Godfathers.
    <h3>
     The Media Hounds
    </h3>
    While the Traditionalists believe that
  the Chantry is moving too fast, these mostly younger mages
  believe it is not moving far enough, or fast enough. Many of them
  have been recruited from the alternative lifestyle culture of San
  Francisco, and still feel the bite that they faced when
  unAwakened. They believe that only through shock tactics and
  pushing the paradigm wide will they gain any measure of success.
  The "in-your-face" style is characteristic of this group, which
  has been working on projects such as the live broadcast of
  body-piercing over public-access cable, which has arroused the
  ire and fury of the more tranditionalist elements of the area,
  especially the Celestial Chorus.
    <h2>
     Nodes
    </h2>
    The Scarlet Mansion, being an Ancestral Chantry,
  has access to some large nodes throughout the world. Many of
  these spots are very secluded, though some of the more public
  ones have drawn suspicion onto the Chantry itself.
    <h3>
     The Temple of Dionysius
    </h3>
    An ancient site sequestered in
  the Zagros mountains of Turkey, this was the home to a radical
  cult following the Greek god Dionysius. Hidden in a narrow
  valley, it is unseen even from the air, and the energies of the
  surrounding mountains makeit difficult to spot this place as a
  node at all.
    <p>
     The dominant feature of this place is the great altar, where
  there is an odd structure, designed to secure the priestess in
  position for the long and arduous rites performed here. Carved
  into the marble of the temple are many scenes of a very risque
  and often bizarre nature, allegedly all depictions of actual
  events here at the temple. The energy of sexual desire and lust
  is strong here, though the height of perversion also hangs to
  taint the area.
    </p>
    <p>
     This site produces tass, but in the oddest of manners. After a
  rite is held here, the priestess (or priest) becomes suffused
  with the energy of the node. The most common method of hrvesting
  Tass from the node at this time is to remove a lock of the
  priest(ess)'s hair, though other methods have been employed.
    </p>
    <h3>
     The Golden Valley
    </h3>
    Along a small stream thorugh the
  mountains of northern Burma lies one of the richest poppy fields
  in the world. Unknown to the outside world, the poppies here are
  special, however, in that in addition to yielding incredibly
  high-grade opium, they also can be refined into Tass, in a form
  that must be smoked or injected to be used.
    <h3>
     White Mountain Springs
    </h3>
    North of the Bay Area is Mount
  Shasta, a semi-active volcano at the extreme southern end of the
  Cascade Range. There are several caves in this area, though only
  a few are of any importance.
    <p>
     One of these is the so-called White Mountain Springs, a small
  cave complex with deep pools of hot, volcanically heated water.
  Bathers would often come to enjoy the heat of the water, to bask
  and relax in the mineral springs.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the volcano that provides the hot waters also provides an
  odd mix of gasses that has often been known to bring on a state
  of near-delirium in the bathers, similar to the trances of the
  Oracle of Delphi. These visions are more often than not prophetic
  in nature, though through use of a Mind rote, visitors to these
  springs who are not magi will forget these visions as soon as
  they cease.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tass from this node is harvested in the form of the large
  salt-like crystals that form from the dissolved minerals. Only
  crystals from pools that have not been bathed in for over a year
  may be harvested, however, so the Cultists are careful to keep
  some of the pools "in reserve".
    </p>
    <h2>
     Horizon Realm
    </h2>
    The Horizon Realm of the Scarlet Mansion is
  an area much like the Mansion and the land around it, save that
  the statuary and hedges continue well beyond the acre they
  currently own. Scattered bout the Realm are images of what the
  Chantry has looked like in the past, from an ancient ziggurat
  from Sumeria, to the Temple to Dionysius (see Nodes, above), to a
  brothel from Constantinople, to a beachfront hotel in Marseilles.
  There are in some places vast fields of poppies, others are
  volcanic springs with narcotic mists, and others fields of rye
  which grow with the ergot fungus. There are no native sentient
  inhabitants, though there is a cculture of servants tht has
  sprung up here, where the chosen of chantrymembers have been
  brought to live out their lives in sensual pleasures.
