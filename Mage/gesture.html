   Nubeb the Gesturer
  </h1>
  <i>

  <p>
   Fetishes can be as dangerous for the owner as for his enemies.
  The statue of Nubeb the Gesturer is infamous for its abilities
  and pure maliciousness.
  </p>
  <p>
   Physically the fetish is around 10 centimetres high, a crude
  wood and bone idol held together by thin straps of leather. Its
  style is primitive but not traceable to any known culture; the
  huge hands seems to imply an origin somewhere among the little
  known tribes in the western Amazon basin, but the eyes made by
  pink pearls suggests an coastal area. And Nubeb wonÂ¹t tell
  anybody anything about its origins.
  </p>
  <p>
   Most sensitive people who see the fetish notices it directly;
  the opalescent and indistinct reflections in its eyes seem to
  follow you around the room, and the huge hands seems to quiver
  slightly as if in anticipation of action. It has a nimbus of
  malevolence and impishness, making most mages leery of touching
  it.
  </p>
  <p>
   The spirit imprisoned within the fetish can only leave when
  ordered to kill a person. If someone orders it against somebody,
  and makes a complex series of gestures (which are recorded on an
  yellowed piece of paper bound to its left leg), Nubeb responds by
  repeating them, doing a small dance and the keeling over as an
  inert piece of wood. The spirit quickly sets out to destroy its
  victim, moving quickly through the Umbra. When it finds its goal,
  it waits for the right moment to use its telekinetic abilities to
  cause death; this can range from a thrown kitchen knife to
  strangulation during sleep. It prefers coincidental effects, but
  if the victim is alone Nubeb sometimes play with it for a while
  by gradually building up a tense mood before moving in for the
  kill.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the deed is done, Nubeb is entitled payment: another
  killing, this time of its own choosing. Apparently the evil being
  takes perverse pride in finding someone near and dear to the
  master and cause his or her death. It never attacks the master
  directly, but if possible it ruins his or her life by killing
  supporters or lovers. After the second deed is done, the spirit
  has to return to the fetish. It stands up, dances and then
  reports what it has done using vivid gestures.
