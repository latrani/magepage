  <h1>
   Construct Tau
  </h1>
  <i>
   by Anders Sandberg
  </i>
  <p>
   The Progenitors are quite known in the technocracy for their
  extremely neat and orderly constructs, far from the loud
  factories of Iteration X or the sometimes academically messy
  Ivory Tower institutions. Tau is one of the neatest constructs
  within the convention, dominated by its unstoppable Research
  Director.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tau lies far from the front lines of the Pogrom. Instead it is
  directed towards unlocking and once and for all solving the
  mysteries of the human nervous system, which in the long run may
  prove more important to win the Ascension War than any number of
  HIT Marks or destroyed tradition chantries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Under the leadership of Research Director Wolfgang S. Sparrel
  Tau has grown and flourished, from a mediocre academic construct
  to a leading force within neuroscience, well renowned for its
  important research. It moved to its current location in the
  middle 80's from Stanford, a move that turned out to be fruitful
  in many ways. The new buildings still feel fresh, and the
  location has made it popular for visiting researchers. At the
  same time there has been a subtle change of mood, infusing the
  construct will new energy.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sparrel has some definite views on how to run the construct.
  The most important principle is that as much work as possible
  should be done within the paradigm; no cloned brains or hybrid
  monsters. This both minimises the need for large amounts of
  quintessence for a horizon realm and protective measures, and
  keeps the researchers focused on work with applications in the
  real world.
  </p>
  <p>
   The second principle is that the construct will be directed
  towards applications helping the Masses in the long run, although
  paradigm engineering and definition is regarded as the most
  important way to help them.
  </p>
  <p>
   The third principle may be the secret of Tau's success; that
  the construct should function as a clearing-house and coordinator
  of research within the neuroscience field. The research at Tau is
  supplemented by research across the world, and the construct
  carefully disseminates information in return.
  </p>
  <p>
   The construct is both well renowned and influential within the
  Progenitors. While some other constructs resent its central
  position and favour with the Administration, it is regarded as
  important in the Progenitor Timetable - if Descartes Null and the
  Labyrinth Solvers can perfect the neuropsychological paradigm the
  convention will have gained an important hold on the mental
  paradigm.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Physical Appearance
  </h2>
  Tau lies in Mountain View just east
  of Stanford, near a wetlands park. In the surroundings are
  slight, dune-like hills covered in grass and many species of
  trees, giving the area a somewhat wild look. Nestled on top of a
  series of hills lies the construct (officially the "Terence A.
  Underhill Medical Foundation"), a series of irregular buildings
  with a trendy look of high technology and ecology. They are all
  airy, with large windows and soft curves built in stone, bricks
  and wood. The buildings are connected by concrete tiled paths
  running gently through the tamed wilderness, an ideal place to
  stroll. The whole complex fits in its surroundings perfectly,
  giving a strong impression of environmental responsibility and
  balance. Actually, the surroundings have been slightly altered by
  the contruct to fit it better.
  <p>
   At the end of the driveway, just in front of the entrance, is
  a polished black, slightly irregular, stone around a meter in
  diameter on a small piece of well-kept lawn. On it the letters
  "Terence A. Underhill Medical Foundation" has been engraved and
  silvered.
  </p>
  <p>
   Inside, the buildings are largely offices and laboratories.
  The colour scale is mainly white, with tasteful additions of
  browns, greys and greens. While the architecture looks irregular
  and adapted to the randomness of the landscape outside, it
  actually follows some subtle rules making it easy for employees
  to find their way around. Most of the buildings are just two
  stories high, but there are some underground facilities and
  basements linked by a network of tunnels. Down here are the PET
  scan lab, reserve power and some of the high-security labs.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Security Director has a tough job with this kind of open
  architecture. Despite the problems, he has succeeded admirably by
  partially relying on security support from neighbouring
  constructs (Research Director Sparrel's political clout has been
  crucial for this) and high technology. The surrounding landscape
  is in fact filled with very discrete sensors, a network of
  tendrils extending from the construct and noticing any
  disturbance. The windows, doors, ventilation system and parts of
  the walls are larmed and much sturdier than they look - the
  windows are bullet-proof. Inside the building most doors are
  locked with magnetic passkeys combined with personal codes, and
  access to the most sensitive areas require a DNA scan
  (camouflaged as a fingerprint scanner). Beside the Security
  Director, there are six guards in the construct, all equipped
  with efficient but nonlethal weapons.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Amalgams
  </h2>
  There are several amalgams at work within the
  construct. The four major are:
  <p>
   The Labyrinth Solvers, officially the Functional Neuroanatomy
  Group, map the brain and study/define its functions. The amalgam
  is not the most prestigious in the construct, but one of the
  largest and busiest. Most of their work consists of elaborate
  animal experiments or PET scans of human volunteers. Currently
  they are mainly supporting the work of Descartes Null and the
  Unwrinklers, although their long-term project of mapping the
  limbic system is progressing nicely. Primary Investigator
  Jonathan W. Lewisdale is a meticulous researcher, often verging
  on the overcautious, but he leads the various teams of the group
  quite well.
  </p>
  <p>
   Descartes Null, the Cognitive Research Group is the cutting
  edge. The Progenitors have for a long time sought to delineate
  how intelligence and consciousness arise in the nervous system,
  to once and for all turn mental function into biology. The main
  problems so far have been political rather than scientific. The
  New World Order has long demanded to have a say in the question,
  and not until the amalgam was formed with several representatives
  from the Ivory Tower did the work get seriously underway. Today
  Descartes Null is making cautious progress in the uncharted
  waters of consciousness, gradually defining how it works. To the
  surprise of many outsiders the amalgam works perfectly together
  as a team, uniting the skills of Progenitor neurologists and New
  World Order psychologists. It is led by Primary Investigator
  Laura I. Sandell, a psychologist fairly new to the construct.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Neuromedical Research Group, known as the Unwrinklers, are
  working on the cure for various neurological diseases. Currently
  their main research thrust is against Alzheimer¹s disease.
  Apparently the disease is indirectly caused by the extended
  lifespan of most people, people live longer than they are
  supposed to and their Avatars seem to move away from them. The
  group is trying to find efficient methods of binding the avatars
  more strongly to the brain, so that this degeneration do not
  occur. Other internal projects study multiple sclerosis,
  Parkinson's disease and ALS, trying to determine the best way to
  introduce their cures in the paradigm. Primary Investigator
  Michel Merleau-Ponty is more of a hands-on person, and he and his
  group often visit hospitals and institutes to test their ideas in
  real life and see what might work from a sleeper perspective.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Preventative Medicine Group is the most secretive amalgam
  in the construct, and located in its own building a bit away from
  the rest of the construct. It is however quite clear to the other
  amalgams that their real work is: biological weapons. Under the
  direction of Dr. Tytti Vinainen the PMG has developed several
  discrete and deadly weapons, such as virus infections targeted at
  individual people, a strain of herpes that attacks bionic
  interfaces and a form of epidemic meningitis causing debilitating
  hallucinations. Its general direction seems to be viral and
  microbial (with some work on psycholytic drugs), often using very
  subtle means to create diseases for assassination and
  psychological warfare. It has also supplied the construct guards
  with some very special ammunition.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Node
  </h2>
  The black stone in front of the buildings (which
  reappears in its letterhead) is the last visible remains of the
  old node the construct was built on. Sparrel has determined that
  this location was a sacred place long before the white man
  appeared, and it is not unlikely that healing shamanic rites were
  performed in front of the stone. By inscribing the name of the
  construct (and sanitising the node) Tau now feeds on its energy.
  It is only of moderate power, making it essential to economise
  with the quintessence somewhat, but that only suits Sparrel well
  since he like to keep his research teams lean and mean.
  <p>
   However, the node may not be completely dead. It might not be
  a coincidence that the Research Directors room overlooks the
  stone, and that the great man often stands looking through his
  window at its black surface. Sparrel sometimes indulges in the
  mental game of discussing with his superego or other personality
  aspects while looking at the inscrutable surface, sometimes
  coming to surprising insights. Often he is reminded of his duty
  to the Masses, to give them health and happiness at all
  costs.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Realms
  </h2>
  Tau has two separate realms, both very small
  for a construct of this size. One is the Analysis Centre, where
  the Labyrinth Solvers perform their most complex experiments. It
  looks just like an extension of the buildings, filled with labs
  and experiment rooms where test subjects can be stimulated in
  various ways. It is reachable from the elevators of the main
  building by using a special pass key; the car will move up to an
  extra floor above the others. This is heaven for an
  neuropsychologist, every conceivable tool for studying the brain
  is available, including some far beyond current technology like
  nanoprobes and microwave neural stimulators. A special room is
  filled with advanced computer workstations and virtual reality
  gear, where researchers build the final atlas of the brain step
  by step.
  <p>
   The other realm is the High Security Lab of the PMG. It is a
  bunker- like construction beneath their building, with elaborate
  security measures. Inside the most deadly projects are developed
  and stored, and if something goes wrong it will be sealed
  hermetically. There is even an option to launch it into the Deep
  Umbra and cut the quintessence supply, something that would lead
  to the dissolution into nothingness of it (and everything
  inside). It contains a series of austere labs lit by merciless
  fluoroscent light, where waldos and robotic manipulators are used
  to work with the weapons. Behind thick glass walls rats and
  monkeys are exposed to them, and latter dissected. This is the
  domain of PI. Tytti.
  </p>
  <h2>
   <a name="SPAR">
    Research Director Wolfgang S.
  Sparrel
   </a>
  </h2>
  Wolfgang S. Sparrel was born into the
  Technocracy. His parents were both Progenitors, and gave their
  child only the best: good genes, an impressive education and
  unshakeable self-confidence. The first thing he learned was that
  he could become anything he set his mind to, reach any goal, and
  if he failed the fault was entirely his. He decided to grow up to
  become a true leader, and of course succeeded completely.
  <p>
   Beside studying medicine, he also became interested in history
  and finished a MA. in history of science shortly after his MD.,
  to the surprise and delight of the Ivory Tower. Since that time
  he has been a regular guest on Technocracy historical meetings
  and maintained excellent relations with the convention, something
  that has proven very beneficial for his career. That he managed
  to form Cartesius Null is just one testament to his contacts and
  diplomatic skills.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sparrel is a renaissance man, quite knowledgeable in both the
  latest recombinant techniques and obscure rites of manhood on the
  Polynesian islands. He keeps himself in perfect shape, practices
  positive thinking and various mental techniques that help him
  remember just about everything. He actually disdains the use of
  outside help, like smart drugs or implants, but accepts that less
  gifted people may need them.
  </p>
  <p>
   As Chairman of the Board, he has a firm grip over the
  construct, and nobody disputes his word. That doesn't mean he is
  inaccessible, only respected. He is quite likely to wander into
  someone's lab and demand a full report of current work,
  mercilessly (but fairly) questioning about methods, results and
  goals.
  </p>
  <p>
   Physically he looks quite good (naturally). He is 41 years old
  but looks like 30, with a well defined physique and striking
  green eyes. His tan is perfect, his hair a slightly bleached
  brown. His clothing is conservative as expected but with a hint
  of personal style; on rare occasions he might even look downright
  fashionable.
  </p>
  <p>
   His office on the second floor is almost a museum of medical
  history. Old bookshelves are filled with classic literature,
  interspersed with old medical curiosities. Behind glass he keeps
  some very old and rare manuscripts relating to the Hippocratic
  Circle, the origin of the convention, and the knowledge of
  Galenos. In fact, his library would make many tradition mages
  envious, and some mages would probably be willing to kill for
  some of the documents if they knew about their existence. A few
  of his friends in the Ivory Tower has even warned him that some
  of this information could be quite dangerous in the wrong hands,
  so on their urging he has installed an extra alarm system.
  </p>
  <p>
   Roleplaying tips: You are good at leading people, and take
  pride in it. Everything worth doing is worth doing well, doing
  less is unthinkable to you. Never loose your temper, in a crisis
  take stock of the situation and do something constructive.
  Combine every positive affirmation you have ever heard and make
  them real. Never patronise people, make them do something
  useful.
  </p>
  <h2>
   <a name="TYTT">
    Primary Investigator Tytti
  Vinainen
   </a>
  </h2>
  Tytti is a small, birdlike woman in her late
  50's, reminding most people about a wrinkled sparrow in a lab
  coat. While she looks unassuming, her raw passion for her work is
  quickly felt, and few subordinates (or superiors) dare oppose her
  - her barbed wit has driven more than one student close to a
  breakdown.
  <p>
   Tytti originally came from Finland to the United States in the
  50's, a young biology student uncertain of herself and her
  skills. During her education she met Jake McNeill, a surgeon she
  fell in love with and latter married. Jake gave her what she
  needed, a comforting and safe presence to balance her nervous
  energy. As her confidence grew, she came to the attention of the
  Progenitors who invited her to join in their great quest. At
  first tentatively, later increasingly ambitiously she learned the
  secrets of true genetics and how they could be applied, all the
  while supported by her loving Jake.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1970 disaster struck: Jake was killed in the Vietnam war
  when his field hospital was accidentally destroyed. Jake, being a
  mere sympathiser had no clone bodies. Tytti was devastated, and
  seriously considered committing suicide or joining the
  Traditions. But gradually her resolve returned, this time sharp
  as glass. What had killed her love was war; she would kill war.
  She turned to biological weapons for the solution - carefully
  tuned means of assassination and control would make war
  impossible once the Technocracy was firmly in power.
  </p>
  <p>
   Over the years her bitterness and energy has grown, as she
  sees how little progress she has made towards her goals. She was
  quite happy to see the Warmonger faction of the NWO dissolve in
  the late 80's, but that only shifted the wars to the local level.
  While her skills are remarkable, she has been transferred several
  times the last decade due to incidents of insubordination and
  other problems. In fact, Research Director Sparrel is the first
  superior that has managed to keep her in line for a longer period
  of time. She has begun to consider developing some new weapons on
  her own and give to the Masses, but so far she has worked openly
  under the Research Director. Her latest project, the anti-bionic
  virus was however too politically sensitive and put on ice to her
  great disappointment. Perhaps she will not tell Sparrel the
  entire truth next time.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tytti inhabits a world of abstract passion incomprehensible
  for most people. To her genes, disease vectors and immune
  reactions are weapons in her private war for peace, a war that is
  just as much within herself as it is against the forces that
  create war: the damnable politicians, the hawks in the
  Technocracy, the Nephandi, the Traditions. She dreams of an
  unification that will awaken mankind and kill those responsible
  for suffering, but at the same time she is coldly rational about
  it.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sparrel understands some of her mindset, but far from all of
  it. He regards her as a great but broken spirit, who never dared
  take the step from darkness into light and unity. If he really
  understood her motivations, he would probably immediately remove
  her from her position.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tytti rules the PMG through a mixture of fear, energy and
  skill. Nothing happens she doesn't know, she always checks every
  experiments and demands total obedience and efficiency from her
  subordinates. Her current project is quite elegant: a virus
  infection attacking just a few of the nuclei of amygdala,
  destroying the aggressive and dominance-seeking behaviours of the
  victims. If used properly, it could turn anybody into a meek
  nobody. Tytti is however looking at the possibilities of making
  the virus target aggressive people more specifically.
  </p>
  <p>
   Roleplaying tips: You cannot sit still for a moment, and are
  always in motion, in action. Sleep is for other people, you have
  work to do. When you talk, you talk with intensity and often
  poisoned wit (including to your superiors). If someone is violent
  or admires war and death, he or she doesn't really deserve to
  live.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Future of Tau
  </h2>
  Tau is so far untested. Its present and
  near future looks bright, but sooner or latter the Testing will
  come which will determine its future. Right now everything is
  tied to the dynamic Research Director, and if he would disappear
  or change, the entire construct may follow him or collapse. The
  construct will also get into problems if it tries to grow larger,
  as its quintessence supply is already limited. And what will
  happen to Tytti? Will she eventually explode into self-
  destructive hate, or will she unite her self again into something
  new?
  <h2>
   Mood
  </h2>
  The darkness of mystery is mercilessly banished by
  the light of knowledge. Soon mankind will not have to worry about
  the mysteries of consciousness, because Descartes Null will have
  found a suitable truth; the labyrinth of the brain is being
  solved and the entropic secrets of age and infirmity are being
  cured.
  <p>
   Tau is the Technocracy at its best and its worst; nothing is
  allowed to be disharmonious or wrong, making everything slightly
  bland despite the best intentions. The surrounding wilderness
  serve a purpose, and has been slightly influenced to fit the
  construct and vice versa.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the same time there is a nuance of conscience in the
  construct. The Research Director doesn¹t seek personal power
  (he already got it) or renown (he got that too). Instead he
  actually seeks to help mankind through the technocratic paradigm,
  and his views reflect in his subordinates. The old healing oaths
  passed down from Hippocrates or the unnamed shamans who once
  danced around the stone still hold some power, albeit in a much
  different, almost warped form.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Some Results of the PMG
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Lymphocytic Meningitis-derived Hallucinogenic Infection
  54
  </h3>
  This infection causes vivid hallucinations in its victims.
  Its first symptoms are sweating, headache and mild fever. After a
  few hours the first hallucinations appear, at first simple visual
  illusions (shadows looking like people, objects moving in the
  corner of the eyes) but later more and more vivid hallucinations
  appear, both visual, auditory and tactile.
  <p>
   The victims sometimes completely loose touch with reality. The
  acute phase of the disease lasts only a few hours, but minor
  hallucinations may remain for days. Most victims become very
  distressed and fearful, which in turns makes the hallucinations
  more horrible. A comforting friend can help the victim, at least
  when the hallucinations do not warp reality completely.
  </p>
  <p>
   [The minor symptoms give -1 dice distraction beside the
  hallucinations. The disease has a strength of 5 initially. At
  infection, secretly roll the victim's stamina against a
  difficulty of 6, subtracting each success from the disease. A
  botch will increase the strength with one per rolled one. The
  disease strength levels is roughly equal to Quiet levels, and
  mages may release hobgoblins or even start using magick without
  control.
  </p>
  <p>
   After 4 hours, roll stamina again and decrease the disease
  strength. This continues every 24 hours afterwards, until the
  victim is cured. If
   <i>
    all
   </i>
   stamina dices come up as ones, the
  disease has become chronic. ]
  </p>
  <h3>
   Shut-Down (CNS inhibitor G)
  </h3>
  This is a drug used in the
  injection pistols used in Tau. It is a very powerful sedative,
  quite able to calm down a raging grizzly bear. Its main drawback
  is that it takes a short while to act.
  <p>
   [The drug does stun damage. Initially one dose gives 7 levels
  of stun, but it can be soaked with stamina. Each unsoaked level
  will decrease the dice pool as if it was an additional lost
  health level, and if the sum reaches incapacitated the victim
  will fall asleep. Increased doses will add upp, but if the victim
  takes the double amount of health levels of stun, there is risk
  for respiratory arrest.
  </p>
  <p>
   It takes stamina turns to act on the victim, during which time
  the stun damage gradually appears (eg. if a victim takes 6 levels
  of stun and has stamina 3, the first turn she will get 2 points
  stun, the second turn another 2 points, and so one). During this
  time, if the stun damage is above the willpower of the victim, he
  will become very calm and peaceful. ]
  </p>
  <h3>
   Herpes Derived Progressive Neurodegenerative Disorder
  (HDPND)
  </h3>
  The Progenitors don't like the idea of Virtual Adepts
  with bionics at all, and a Research Team at Tau developed an
  insidious weapon against such implants. It is a slightly modified
  form of the usual type one herpes virus, almost indistinguishable
  from the original. The virus causes small sores in the mouth, and
  between infections it hides within nerve cells. However, when it
  encounters neurones linked to bionic implants it will change into
  an active form, replicating quickly and spreading through the
  nervous systems. The result is at least severe and permanent
  nerve damage to the nerves linked to the implant, and quite
  possibly (if the implant is linked to the central nervous system)
  death.
  <p>
   Shortly after Tau had developed HDPND Research Director
  Sparrel pointed out that it would be an even deadlier weapon
  against Iteration X - widespread use of HDPND would most
  certainly lead to great losses among the iterators or force them
  to retreat to Autocthonia and MECHA. The Administration decided
  to keep the entire project secret from the rest of the
  Technocracy. Any use of a HDPND strain (TAU has developed some
  short-lived strains that will hopefully not spread out of
  control) has to be cleared with the Administration.
  </p>
  <p>
   [ HDPND will not affect normal people in any way, except for
  the usual effects of a minor viral infection. It can be cured
  with Life, but most mages won't notice it if they aren't looking,
  and to detect that it is in fact artificial requires a detailed
  genetic mapping (Requires a genetic laboratory, Intelligence +
  Medicine with a difficulty of 7).
  </p>
  <p>
   When it infects a person with bionics, it goes into attack
  mode and will begin to destroy the nerves linked to the implant.
  The first symptoms are usually minor malfunctions of the implant;
  twitches of bionic arms, cybervision blurring or neural jacks
  becoming unreliable. This is quickly followed by severe problems
  with the implant, fever and often paralysis of the limb the
  implant is in or severe lumbago if the implant is located in the
  head.
  </p>
  <p>
   For each point of implants, the virus will do one point of
  localised aggravated damage. The amount of damage can be
  decreased with one point for each success of a stamina rolled
  against 8 (botches give extra damage) and in addition quick
  medical help (Within a few hours, Int + Medicine against 8) or
  vulgar Life magick can ameliorate the disease. The damage will
  destroy the nerves linked to the implant and possibly spread
  further in the nervous system, causing paralysis, mental damage
  or death. ]
