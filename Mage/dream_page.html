   Dreamspeaker paradigm page

  This is about as close as I can come to a
  unified dreamspeaker paradigm, though any individual dreamspeaker
  would probably vary this paradigm's terminology I don't think
  mant would actively disagree with the conceptual framework.

  <hr>
   Understand that we are all held in the mind of Gaia (Paradigm),
  we live in her dreams. Our lives and struggles are played out
  within her sleep. Gaia is the mother of the universe and is
  present in all parts of the universe. If you wish to change Gaia
  (magic), or rather convince Gaia to be changed, you must first
  understand that the world is not as you have allways been taught.
  You have forgotten the truth, except in your dreams. Listen to
  your dreams, know that they are true, and from them remember once
  again that your life has more to it than simple existance, and
  the world has more wonder in it than can be encompassed in cold,
  grey, facts. How much more? Listen and I will tell you of the
  truth of the world (magic).
   <p>
    Listen. Do you hear the spirits of the air racing back and
  forth, or do you only hear the wind in the trees. Do you see the
  beings of your dreams as you walk the streets, or are they but
  tricks of the light. Know that these spirits (Spirit) are real,
  have allways been real, and will allways be real. We all living
  here now are little different from spirits, from the world of
  spirit we were drawn to live, and to it we will return when we
  die. Truely, we are already in it, but have become so blinded to
  it that most do not see that even now we, and all we know exist
  in the spirit world. To see again the wonder of the spirits you
  must free you soul from worldly shackles. Let your mind grow
  wings, and let your spirit soar into the heavens. Let your soul
  be like a bird moving through the vastness of the world as it
  truely is. On your travels you will see many starange things.
  Remember that they, like you, are children of Gaia. Be warned
  though, some children of Gaia have become twisted from the path
  of Gaia's wishes and seek her unbeing.
   </p>
   <p>
    Why, you ask, is the world we know different from the world
  that is. Know that as Gaia dreams her dreams things from the
  world of spirit, the children of Gaia, are drawn to become part
  of the Dream of Gaia (Correspondence, Entropy, Forces, Matter,
  Time). This dream of Gaia is the world that we know. To
  understand the aspects of the world of Gaia dreaming you must
  feel the rhythms that Gaia dreams to. To induce Gaia to change
  her dreaming you must match your rhythms to Gaia's, then slowly
  suggest a change to those rythms. If Gaia is willing, then she
  will follow your lead and change her dream.
   </p>
   <p>
    What then distinguishes us from the other aspects of Gaia's
  dream? We, meaning all life in the world, are those beings of
  spirit that have been drawn into Gaia's dream as the dreamt
  about. We are the thought of Gaia (Life, Mind, Prime), about whom
  her dreams are woven. You know how in your own dreaming there are
  those things in the dream that you are dreaming about, and so
  seem more active and memorable. In the dream of Gaia the
  attention of Gaia (Prime) gives those aspects of the spirit world
  that are called to dance in it's light both life and meaning. To
  understand these thoughts of Gaia you must draw the attention of
  Gaia upon you, through your symbols of the presence of Gaia
  (normally crystals).
   </p>
   <p>
    As one who walks the path of spirits grows in wisdom (Arete)
  their knowledge of themselves and their relationship to Gaia
  improves, granting them abilities that may seem hard to
  comprehend to those less wise. What gives a person a link to the
  spirits, and the spirit of Gaia, is the link with a special
  personal spirit (Avatar). Some Dreamspeakers will call this a
  personal totem, some a spirit guide, and some other things. All
  will tell you that your ability to understand Gaia depends on
  your ability to undertand this spirit.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some who follow the path of dreamspeaker walk so instinctively
  in tune with the rhythms of the world that they are hard to
  notice as seperate from the world (Arcane). Still others Gaia
  dreams powerful dreams for (Destiny). Then there are those who
  are priviledged to have Gaia share her dreams with them (Dream).
  The easiest place to understand Gaia is in a place of Dreaming
  (Node). Here it is possible to draw the attention of Gaia
  (Quintesence) upon you and into you, making it easier to convince
  Gaia to act according to your will. Be warned that if your
  actions are not in harmony with Gaia however, you will attract
  her scorn (Paradox). This will leave you outcast and cursed,
  until Gaia's favour is regained
