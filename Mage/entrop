Here is how I deal with Entropy:

Entropy mainly deals with how patterns change and organize
themselves. While many mages concentrate on the disorder/randomness
aspect, other mages use it too increase order and remove unwanted
factors. 

The division of levels deal with what kind of system is affected:

Level 2 deals with chaotic systems, where the creation and
dissolution of patterns are completely unpredictable (randomness).
It allows the mage to control how it behaves, like biasing
probabilities or making certain patterns appear. 

Level 3 deals with systems which in their natural state are
stable but subjected to the third law of thermodynamics (closed
systems and similar things), they gradually move towards higher
levels of entropy. The mage can control how this happens, like
making a stick wither or making crystallization become perfect.

Level 4 deals with systems which try to remain in their state,
like living beings, and when disturbed actively try to return.
The mage can now interfere/help this process, making it harder
or simpler for a living being to heal or an organisation to
survive a budget cut.

Level 5 deals with *all* systems, even systems which are normally
outside of change. Now the mage can attack the organization of
any system, including abstract ideas, time, space and magick itself.
