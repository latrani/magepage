  <h1>
   Electronic Cats
  </h1>

   by Anders Sandberg

  <blockquote>
   I was in that comfortable state between waking and sleeping
    when suddenly a small cat jumped up on my back, turned around a
    few turns (as if to inspect its new domain) and then scurried
    down to the end of the bed where it sat down and began to lick
    itself, purring contentedly. I rested in warm assurance for
    several minutes before a small thought began to intrude into my
    consciousness.
   <i>
    I didn't own a cat
   </i>
   . But how could a cat
    appear in my apartment? I looked up, and for a moment I thought
    the cat had vanished like a dream.
   <p>
    But then I saw a shape on the desk, a small grey figure
    watching me intently with shining green eyes. Our eyes met, and
    it was as if the kitten carefully read my soul without giving
    any hints back. When I suddenly broke free the cat jumped down
    from the desk, padded over to the bookcase and calmly walked
    into the tiny crack between two dictionaries.
   </p>
   <p>
    Shocked and confused I jumped up and looked into the crack.
    Inside the tiny space I clearly saw how the cat had removed
    parts of its fur, revealing printed circuits and
    electromechanical muscles, and a flat cable connected it to a
    socket inside the darkness. It purred. Suddenly it turned
    around, impaling me with its green gaze, filling my field of
    vision. I awoke in my bed, alone.

  Cats are mysterious even to mages. That many felines
  can see into the Umbra is quite well known, but there are other
  kinds of cats too, cats so bizarre that perhaps only the
  marauders understand them.
  <p>
   The electronic cats look and behave almost as normal cats.
  They like to eat fish, stalk through the night, hunt and play
  with rats. When stroked they purr or bite, just as unpredictably
  as normal cats. But beneath the warm and furry skin (which is
  removable) they are built out of electronics and artificial
  muscles covering an aluminium skeleton. They are apparently
  biomechanical devices, not unlike the HIT Marks of Iteration X.
  But the Technocracy has not sent them; they appear out of
  nowhere, behave normally and then vanish, transmitting
  information they have gathered... where?
  </p>
  <p>
   Electronic cats seem to be able to cross the Gauntlet freely,
  and often do so. They also seem to have almost quantum
  properties: when watched they behave normally, but as soon as you
  look away they can vanish and appear somewhere else, even in
  locked rooms or on top of inaccessible places. Their gaze is
  almost hypnotic; they will never look away or blink, keeping the
  opponent fixed with an intense stare. And they seem to extract
  information from the minds of anybody who looks in their
  eyes...

   Electronic cats have claws that do one die of damage; they are
  not especially powerful fighters and will try to flee from
  attackers or hide. If pressed they will vanish completely.

   Powers
  </h3>
  <b>
   Suck Information (Mind 4)
  </b>
  The cat can read
  the memories of a person, storing them within its own circuits.
  <p>
   <b>
    Forget it (Mind 4)
   </b>
   The cat can briefly take control
  over a person and rewrite his memories to make the person forget
  a specific event, such as seeing the cats innards or that it has
  just emerged from empty air.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Vanish away (Corr 3 Spirit 3)
   </b>
   If unobserved, the cat
  can appear somewhere else, or move into the Umbra.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Cute (Mind 2)
   </b>
   The cat can look cute and irresistibly
  cuddly, or beautiful and dignified. Each success will increase
  the difficulty of harming or interfering with the cat one step
  the first time someone attempts it.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Remember (Mind 1)
   </b>
   The cat remembers
   <i>
    everything
   </i>
   it sees and experiences, and can later transmit this
  information.
