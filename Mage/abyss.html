     A Prayer to Tiamat:
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
     <em>
      Mother Tiamat,
      <br>
       Change me.
       <br>
        Grant me a form of your choice.
       </br>
      </br>
     </em>
     <p>
      <em>
       I have no form.

     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       I had a shape.
       <br>
        I thought it was mine,
        <br>
         But it rotted
         <br>
          The worms ate it.
         </br>
        </br>
       </br>

     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Let me be your worm.
       <br>
        I want to eat myself.

      <em>
       Self-eater, Ourouboros,
       <br>
        The serpent of my soul
        <br>
         Swallows itself, understanding that
         <br>
          There was no apple
          <br>
           No Eve
           <br>

         <br>
          I am the apple,
          <br>
           And the worm.
           <br>
            The Nothingness in the apple of Being.

        Ragged claws, six legs, pipestem eyes
        <br>

    The Church of the Great Abyss was founded by our
  Mother Tiamat at 9:00 pm on the 26th. of October (according to
  the Rev. James Lightfoot, a notable Hebraist) in the year 4004 BC
  (if you accept the calculations of Bishop Ussher).
    <p>
     At that moment our Mother received the Word in a virulent form
  and went completely to pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Father could have been Ophion
     <br>
      (according to the Pelasgians)
      <br>
       or Elohim
       <br>
        (according to the Hebrews)
        <br>
         or Ialdebaoth
         <br>
          (according to the Gnostics)
          <br>
           or Eros
           <br>
            (according to Hesiod)
            <br>
             or any one of a posse of playboy demiurges
             <br>
              who hovered
              <br>
               menacingly
               <br>
                over the deeps,
                <br>
                 dangling their dongles in the primordial abyss.
                </br>
               </br>
              </br>
             </br>
            </br>
           </br>
          </br>
         </br>
        </br>
       </br>
      </br>
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     He did not wait around.
     <br>
      Protoplasm does not jive with the purity of the Logos.
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     "I never saw his face." she sighed.
     <br>
      "He breathed sweet nothings in my ear, saying
      <br>
       'Let there be....'
       <br>
        And I didn't catch the end of it."
       </br>
      </br>
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     Our Mother, the Great She-Toad, filled the deeps with her
  spawn.
     <br>
      In each egg,
      <br>
       A world fertilised by the drifting semen of the Word.
      </br>
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     The world-spawn drifted in the deeps.
     <br>
      The oldest hatched, each from its world-egg,
      <br>
       No two alike, no two different.
       <br>
        The ministry of our Great Mother was begat by the monstrous
  firstborn,
        <br>
         apostles to the world-spawn.
        </br>
       </br>
      </br>
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Believe in the Mother," they murmered,
     <br>
      "Or we will surely devour you."
      <br>
       "Believe in the Mother," they murmered,
       <br>
        "And we will certainly devour you."
        <br>
         "Believe in doubly-valued logic," they slavered,
         <br>
          "And you deserve what you get."
         </br>
        </br>
       </br>
      </br>
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     Our Mother is the mother of chaos. No two of her children are
  alike.
     <br>
      Identity is an abstraction,
      <br>
       and abstractions lead to unity,
       <br>
        to a deus absconditus
        <br>
         who wandered off,
         <br>
          parting the veils of the Unmanifest
          <br>
           Like a virgin's bloody flower.
          </br>
         </br>
        </br>
       </br>
      </br>
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     Our Mother is the mother of chaos. No two of her children are
  different.
     <br>
      Difference presumes identity,
      <br>
       identity is an abstraction,
       <br>
        and abstractions lead to the House of God.
       </br>
      </br>
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     La Maison Dieu -
     <br>
      a folly
      <br>
       of towering
       <br>
        proportions.
       </br>
      </br>
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     To be something is an identification.
     <br>
      To be something is an abstraction.
      <br>
       Abstractions are the disease of a mind dreaming in a
  world-egg
       <br>
        drifting in the Deep.
       </br>
      </br>
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     Noisy pots cannot comprehend their emptiness.
     <br>
      Those who know what they are,
      <br>
       are anathema to our Mother.
       <br>
        Swim with the firstborn.
        <br>
         Embrace the Deep.
        </br>
       </br>
      </br>
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     Let go of the something - become everything and nothing.
     <br>
      To be nothing, you must sacrifice everything.
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     There is a way.
     <br>
      I, Miranda Raven, am that way.
      <br>
       Not the means, but certainly the way...
      </br>
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     I will take your everything.
    </p>
    <p>
     I will take your gold rings, and your silver chains.
     <br>
      Your crowns and your crosses.
      <br>
       Your teeth.
      </br>
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     (I don't particularly want your teeth, but there might be gold
  in them, and it will do you no harm to undergo the indignity of
  losing them.)
    </p>
    <p>
     I will take your wet dreams.
     <br>
      The loose change in your pocket.
      <br>
       Your pension.
       <br>
        Your lustrous hair.
        <br>
         Your fine muscles.
        </br>
       </br>
      </br>
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     (Which will wither in any case, so give them now while you can
  - there is no use in wailing at the gates of Hell).
    </p>
    <p>
     I will smoke your ambition in my bubble pipe,
     <br>
      and become intoxicated with your dreams.
      <br>
       I will saddle your nightmares and visit my kin.
      </br>
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     You owe me your living.
     <br>
      Strew my path with furs,
      <br>
       That I may tread barefoot through your soul.
       <br>
        Carve a throne of black obsidian in your heart
        <br>
         That I might be seated in the midst of your desires.
         <br>
          Shower me with gold and jewels for no reason at all
         </br>
        </br>
       </br>
      </br>
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     (But it seems like an excellent idea).
    </p>
    <p>
     For the more literal, dollar bills will do.
     <br>
      Give me your equities - less lyrical than ermine furs,
      <br>
       But spreadsheets have their own splendour,
       <br>
        And accountants serve me better than temple eunuchs.
       </br>
      </br>
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     I am a grasping and greedy woman who loves luxury.
     <br>
      Mother Tiamat grants her priestess this indulgence:
      <br>
       to revel in the riches others have discarded.
       <br>
        Only an impeccable and undiscerning greed
        <br>
         can consume your everything and set you free.
        </br>
       </br>
      </br>
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     Give me your pride, your ambition, your loose change,
     <br>
      And whatever teeth remain,
      <br>
       And I will walk you to the edge of the deep,
       <br>
        Where the old ones wait for noisy pots
        <br>
         Bearing the banners of this-or-that,
         <br>
          Red-crossed banners of bisection
          <br>
           Marching on their new Jerusalem.
          </br>
         </br>
        </br>
       </br>
      </br>
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     Into the maws. Into the maws.
    </p>
    <p>
     I will show you the Gates (fifty),
     <br>
      And Paths (thirty-two),
      <br>
       And the world-spawn (beyond the artifice of gematria).
      </br>
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     And now to my discipline....
    </p>
    <p>
     Like a hand outstretched in the sun,
     <br>
      each thing evokes its shadow.
      <br>
       Our Mother wants
       <br>
        no pallid unification,
        <br>
         each thing with its opposite,
         <br>
          dancing a stately minuet into the Ark,
          <br>
           (as if that could preserve the world from a rising tide).
          </br>
         </br>
        </br>
       </br>
      </br>
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     You must become your shadow. Your shadows. Devolve.
    </p>
    <p>
     Metamorphosis. Transformation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Transmogrification. Umbrification.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mother Chaos is a fine masseur,
     <br>
      kneading the knots of self-importance
      <br>
       and belief,
       <br>
        blurring the bisections and the boundaries
        <br>
         between this-or-that.
         <br>
          Let our Mother take your form
          <br>
           for feeding to her kin..
          </br>
         </br>
        </br>
       </br>
      </br>
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     You won't be needing it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Scorn the fishers of men -
     <br>
      acquire the manners of fish.
      <br>
       Devolve.
       <br>
        Back to the slime, back to the ooze.
       </br>
      </br>
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     You could be kelp, swaying in the ocean swell.
     <br>
      A sea-slug, corpulent on the sandy floor.
      <br>
       A swimming supper for phosphorescent jaws.
       <br>
        A spiny horror fast to a rock.
       </br>
      </br>
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     And stranger still in the coal-scuttle deeps,
     <br>
      tossed and swirled in the anthracite wake of Leviathon,
      <br>
       bobbing with the world spawn in the briny murk
       <br>
        twixt this-or-that.
        <br>
         Consume yourself,
         <br>
          lest the vacant jaws that trawl the deep
          <br>
           find you first,
           <br>
            a cowering worm god curled in a world egg,
            <br>
             the deus absconditus revealed,
             <br>
              the father of your lie.
             </br>
            </br>
           </br>
          </br>
         </br>
