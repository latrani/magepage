	You better not shout
	You better not cry
	You better not pout
	I'm telling you why
	The Men in Black are coming to town

	They're making a list
	And checking it twice
	Gonna find out whose naughty or nice
	The Men in Black are coming to town

	They know when you've been sleeping
	They know when you're awake
	They know when you've been bad or good
	So be good for Consensus sake

	You better not shout
	You better not cry
	You better not pout
	I'm telling you why
	The Men in Black are coming to town!


   Merry Chi$tma$ everyone!
