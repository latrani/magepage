  <h1>
   My house rules and interpretations for Mage
  </h1>
  <h2>
   by Anders Sandberg
  </h2>
  As requested by many on the net
  (including my own players), here is an incomplete list of the
  ways I run Mage:
  <h2>
   General Philosophy:
  </h2>
  The spheres needed for an act of
  magick are determined by its
  <i>
   outcome
  </i>
  , not how it is
  brought about. If a mage wants to create light, this will need
  Forces 3 Prime 2, regardless of how it is created; a sphere of
  brilliant light floating in the air, finding a functional torch
  or having the sun appear out of the clouds are all possible
  effects. If someone wants to limit damage from an bullet, this is
  Life, even if a coincidental explanation involves the presence of
  a whiskey flask.
  <p>
   Coincidental magick only works in the undefined areas of
  reality; if you look out through a window to see if there is a
  trashcan below before doing any magick, it is no longer possible
  to jump out of it and coincidentally land softly in the trash
  (unless of course there actually
   <i>
    was
   </i>
   a trashcan there in
  the first place). Whether things (and people) who appear in
  coincidental explanations existed before or not is impossible to
  tell.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Magick and Paradox:
  </h2>
  Countermagick comes from the Avatar,
  and is active regardless of the state of the mage. However, it
  will only protect the mage from the spheres he are conscious of.
  Other spheres can be used to protect from magick (as in the Book
  of Shadows), but these are consciously applied by the mage and
  requires his actions.
  <p>
   Magick cannot normally be dodged, since the mage usually just
  decides to hurt someone, not to create a magickal effect directed
  in a certain direction. The exception to this is technomagickal
  talismans, which usually are made only to shoot straight, in this
  case the normal firearm rules apply (this is also the case for
  magickal melee weapons etc.).
  </p>
  <p>
   Technomancers can build gizmos or write programs to store
  rotes, which makes them easier or faster to invoke, in addition
  to making them predictable (they work the same way all the time).
  They are not real talismans, just extremely specific foci. In
  addition, this often makes vulgar magick look more static,
  avoiding many witnesses and sometimes even becoming
  coincidental.
  </p>
  <p>
   Magick which causes something that disobeys the rules of local
  reality is vulgar. If no unawakened being observes it, it will be
  vulgar without witnesses. If a mage uses true magick disguised as
  stage magic, it will be vulgar without witnesses. Perception
  magick can be vulgar if the mage acquires information he
  shouldn't have, like finding out a secret password with Mind
  (this can be made coincidental if the mage is "lucky" and finds
  it scribbled somewhere) or sees a distant place using Corr 2.
  Although magick is coincidental in the Umbra, any magick crossing
  over into normal reality will accumulate paradox.
  </p>
  <p>
   Paradox works against talismans and magickal creatures too,
  and generally damage them. Magickal beings gradually wither and
  die, and talismans loose their power unless recharged. If this is
  not done, talismans may break down. In the same way, the number
  of successes which appear when a mage creates a Pattern will
  affect its longevity and stability; a being created with only one
  success will be weak and sickly, while a being created with five
  successes will be both normal and vital.
  </p>
  <p>
   Paradox is usually coincidental, or at least undetectable for
  sleepers. At higher levels it becomes more and more drastic, and
  large backlashes are so severe that they are almost vulgar.
  Usually Paradox covers its tracks, so that nobody can tell
  afterwards what happened. If something paradox-inducing happens,
  but the cause is in the past (and thus cannot receive paradox),
  Paradox will hide or change the outcome; a dragon rampaging down
  fifth avenue in NY would become a huge terrorist attack. Paradox
  can never be controlled or predicted by any means.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Rules and Background:
  </h2>
  Some things are just plain silly,
  and I have removed them from the game: Blatancy, the secret
  language of the Order of Hermes, the new talisman rules etc.
  <p>
   What is possible with a certain sphere depends to a large
  extent on the paradigm of the mage. Some mages may do different
  things from others.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Traditions lack any central organization, although some
  groups within them have some measure of it (like the anarchistic
  network of the VAs or the hierarchies of the
   <a href="Mage/roci2.html">
    Rosicrucians
   </a>
   of the OoH). The Traditions have never been
  unified enough to act as a whole, and individual chantries,
  cabals and mages follow their own lead. The main chantries of the
  traditions are simply the largest and currently most prestigious
  chantries, they have no control over the tradition. The Council
  of Nine is not acknowledged by the large majority of mages, many
  have never even heard of it.
  </p>
  <p>
   Study points are specific for one area, such as Cosmology,
  Spirit or Matter, and cannot be used for anything else (some
  areas might overlap, depending on the kind of studies done).
  Mages may gain study points in certain areas during play if the
  ST finds it useful (if a mage reads up on science before
  participating in a debate, he might gain one science study
  point).
  </p>
  <p>
   Dream also opens up the mind of the mage to outside (or
  rather, subconscious) influences. Arcane works by coincidentally
  removing records of the mage from file, making people overlook
  him or simply miss him. While the mage can partially control
  this, at a high level it is very hard for the mage to keep any
  friends and contacts. It is possible to raise backgrounds during
  or after an story if it fits; a mage may gather more books to
  enlarge his library, invest money to gain resources and if the
  mage has managed to befriend a dragon he will have gained a
  contact. However, it is worth noting that the scale is
  logarithmic, it is much harder for a mage to advance from 4 to 5
  than from 3 to 4.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mages of different traditions can use the libraries or tomes
  of each other, but in general have a hard time understanding
  them. They have to succeed in an intelligence + ability test,
  whose difficulty depends on the level of the sought information
  and how readable the texts are for an outsider (many hermetic
  scholars do their best to complicate and hide facts so that
  nobody else can find them, while some Adepts go out of their way
  to make slick multimedia presentations). Typical abilities to use
  would be: Meditation for the AB, Culture (Arabic) for the
  Ahl-I-Batin, Theology for the CC, Expression for the CoE,
  Intuition for the Euthanatos, Occult for the OoH, Technology or
  Science for the SoE, Survival for the Verbena, Computer for the
  VAs, Psychology for the NWO, Economics for the Syndicate,
  Technology for ItX, Medicine for the Progenitors and Science for
  the VE.
  </p>
  <p>
   Magickal damage is aggravated if it is vulgar magick (and the
  effect should cause it, such as a fireball or invisible forces
  breaking bones, but not if a normal knife appears out of thin air
  and makes a slice), but if it is coincidental the type of damage
  depends on the coincidence (a flamethrower will make aggravated
  damage while a falling log or an accurately thrown knife may
  cause normal damage). Damage can also be made aggravated by
  spending Quintessence (the knife hits an artery or a ligament,
  the falling log crushes the skull of the victim).
  </p>
  <h2>
   Spheres:
  </h2>
  All spheres at level 1 allows the mage to
  perceive the immediate reality of the sphere (its "near umbra"),
  while level 2 allows the mage to perceive the forces underlying
  it (its "deep umbra"). Matter 2 would detect morphogenic fields,
  Life 2 life-force, Prime 2 the structures of ley-lines and nodes
  and Mind 2 detects the emotions which affect the mage from the
  surroundings. Using Spirit the mage may even enter "umbras"
  belonging to the different spheres. These umbras each represent
  another facet of reality, and all fit together into an unified
  whole.
  <h3>
   Correspondence
  </h3>
  Correspondence controls location and
  spatial relationships, but also correspondences between things
  (like the two halves of a ripped paper or a pair of wedding
  rings) and information. At Correspondence 3, the mage can not
  only teleport himself, but also move other things and people,
  both continuously and instantly.
  <h3>
   Entropy
  </h3>
  Entropy not only deals with randomness and
  disorder, but also with order and organization, especially for
  technomancers. For example, Entropy 1 could be used to find
  strong points, level 3 to concentrate energy and level 4 to make
  living beings healthier. Level 3 allows the mage to control all
  systems which decay normally, level 4 affects systems which
  support themselves (like living beings and organizations) and
  level 5 systems which are normally never affected by entropy
  (ideas, space and time).
  <p>

   <a href="Mage/entrop">
    my version of entropy
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <h3>
   Forces
  </h3>
  Forces deal with all forms of energy and physical
  entities that cause or catalyze change. See
  <a href="Mage/forces">
   my version of forces for more details
  </a>
  .
  <p>
   I divide forces into physical forces and abstract forces
  instead of high and low forces. Physical forces are objects in
  their own right, such as light, fire and electricity, while
  abstract forces act through other objects (or other forces) and
  control them, such as momentum, gravity, heat and pressure (not
  to mention the pure elemental forces). Physical forces can be
  created using Forces 3, abstract using Forces 5 (the damage is
  unchanged, although it is possible to increase the damage of a
  physical force by using a higher sphere level).
  </p>
  <p>
   Forces at level 5 also allows the creation of new kinds of
  forces (just as Life 5 and Matter 5 does).
  </p>
  <h3>
   Pattern Magick in General
  </h3>
  It is possible to create
  patterns without feeding them with quintessence; in this case
  they will not have any physical existence, just a potential
  existence (maybe detectable by certain people). However, if they
  fit in with reality well enough, quintessence may "fill them out"
  (e.g. if a large amount of gasoline has been poured on a floor in
  a room where electrical discharges occur, a mage may introduce a
  fire pattern which reality decides fits in perfectly and turns
  real).
  <p>
   Two patterns may be converted into each other by using a
  conjunctional effect of Matter 2/4, Life 4 and/or Forces 2/4
  (Turning a human into light would be Life 4 Forces 2). This
  corresponds to the Infinite Loop rote in the main book.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Prime
  </h3>
  Prime 1 is needed to be able to use and manipulate
  quintessence. A mage without Prime will still accumulate
  quintessence in his pattern up to his Avatar rating, but cannot
  use it for anything (however, the Avatar might use it; in a
  critical situation it might strengthen the magick of the mage).
  To consciously use it or recharge the mage needs Prime 1.
  <p>
   Prime 3 allows the creation of "hanging spells", magickal
  effects imprinted in reality or in items, and short-lived
  talismans.
  </p>
  <p>
   Personal quintessence and Tass may be used in pattern magick
  to replace the normal Prime 2 channelling. This will make the
  pattern much stronger, and usually make it permanent if it is
  Matter or Prime (resonance will of course be strong).
  </p>
  <h3>
   Spirit
  </h3>
  Spirit in general deals with other planes of
  existence, not only the Umbra (although this is the most common
  plane). This is usually done with conjunctional magick; Mind and
  Spirit can move the mage towards the astral realms and
  dreamworlds, while Entropy and Spirit nears the Shadowlands. This
  is highly tradition-dependent.
  <p>
   Spirit 3 also allows the mage to drag other people or objects
  into the umbra. Mages of some traditions are able to wander the
  umbra mentally, without moving there physically (the body is in a
  sleep- like state) or using Mind (Such shamanic journeys are far
  too common in folklore and shamanism to require high
  spheres).
  </p>
  <h3>
   Time
  </h3>
  Time is the sphere that deals with timing (Time 1),
  prediction and postcognition (2), the speed of things (3), but
  also causality (what causes what) and destiny. I usually run
  things deterministically, if a future has been observed
  (especially several times) it is very probable.
