The Devourers of Evil
 
In a calm and quiet realm on the edge of the Horizon, a quintet of 
elderly mages make their home.  The entire realm consists only of a 
weathered house and a small vegetable garden beside it, softly lit by 
some unknown source.  The borders of the realm fade off into the swirling 
darkness of the Deep Umbra, but the realm is carefully hidden and 
warded.  Few can find the realm without the mages' consent.
 
The two women and three men that inhabit the realm live very simply.  
They take turns tending the garden, spending the rest of their time 
relaxing and playing games of strategy such as chess or go.  The mages 
have no names for one another, and little need for them.  They rarely 
speak, and seem to intuitively know each others needs.  If an outsider 
needs to address them, the mages insist on being referred to by some 
minor term of respect, such as "sir" or "madam".
 
The five Devourers are reputed to have extensive esoteric knowledge on 
spirit lore, and younger mages will occasionally seek their advice.  Not 
a few visitors have been lulled by the tranquillity of the realm to 
underestimate the mages' strength and the danger of this realm.  The 
Devourers of Evil are under the burden of a terrible duty, one that few 
mages would be willing to bear.
 
Each of the Devourers has a potent and malignant spirit bound to their 
Avatar, imprisoned inside their very bodies.  Most of the more powerful 
and malevolent spirits of the Deep Umbra are warded from entering the 
physical world.  The spirits held by the Devourers are an exception.  For 
whatever reason, these five spirits are not restricted for crossing the 
Gauntlet, and would likely do so immediately were they free, causing 
untold death and destruction.
 
Though outwardly calm, the five Devourers suffer nearly constant 
torment.  It takes nearly all of their considerable power to keep the 
spirits bound, and the demons struggle eternally to be free.  The strain 
of their inner turmoil will sometimes show through, as one of the 
Devourers will wince or go stiff with pain.  The mages have been known to 
bleed from the eyes and ears, or have gashes appear on their torso, but 
these wounds heal rapidly.
 
The veneer of calm of the Devourers is thin.  Given that they are always 
in terrible agony, their tempers are understandably short.  So long as a 
visitor is quiet and respectful, and does not dig too deeply into their 
affairs, the Devourers are the very picture of the enlightened master.  
Harsh words and needless prying will quickly enrage them, however, and 
their wrath is terrible to see.  The Devourers are perhaps of Oracular 
level in power, and even with most of their strength devoted to holding 
their prisoners, they can easily crush a lesser mage.
 
The Devourers will not reveal their burden casually, but they will do so 
to illustrate a point (such as "Why aren't you Oracles doing any real 
work like the rest of us mages?").  There is one secret which they will 
never share with any outsider: that one of the five demons may have 
already escaped.  The Devourers suspect that one of their number has been 
consumed from within, and that a spirit now controls one of their 
comrades.  This spirit is waiting for the right moment to strike, so that 
it may free the rest of its brethren.  The demon's possession is so 
complete that there is no way to tell which of the Devourers has fallen, 
or even if the demon is there at all.  The mages do not speak of this, 
even with each other, but they all know, and calmly await the inevitable 
day of confrontation with the traitor in their midst.
 
 
 
Story Ideas
 
Advice From the Oracles:  The player characters can visit the Devourers, 
seeking information about a lesser demon that is plaguing them.  The 
younger mages may "get uppity", especially if it occurs to them that 
mages of the Devourers' power could easily solve the problem for them.  
The Devourers will then show them the true nature of their realm.  A few 
moments in the twisted, shrieking landscape that is the Devourers' minds 
ought to humble the most arrogant upstart.
 
Trolling for Demons:  The players character may need knowledge, not from 
the Devourers, but from one of the demons trapped within them.  The 
Devourers would never agree to release the demon, or even allow the it to 
speak.  The mages will have to enter the mindscape that is the demon's 
prison, and try to convince it to tell them what they need to know.  
Within the prison, the demon's power is supreme, and the Devourers will 
not be able to protect the player characters.
 
The demon will be primarily interested in escape, and there is little 
else the mages can offer that will interest it.  It might agree to tell 
them what they need to know, so long as they do the demon "a little 
favor" once they return to the physical world.  If the demon is convinced 
that the player characters will do nothing to help it, it will try to 
trap them in the prison with it, so that it torture them for its own 
amusement.
 
Devouring Evil:  The ravages of time are at last catching up with one of 
the Devourers, and he is slowly dying.  The Devourers have chosen a 
replacement, but are unable to leave the realm themselves to make the 
request.  Instead, they recruit the player characters to speak to the 
mage for them.  The mage in question is extremely powerful, and it will 
take some doing even to be allowed to speak to her.  The mage is also 
very self important, convinced that her role is crucial to the Ascension 
War.  She will become even more reluctant once she learns of the true 
nature of the task; an eternity of pain is not exactly what she had in 
mind for her retirement.
 
The player characters must somehow teach the replacement the value of 
self-sacrifice.  This should require a good deal of soul-searching on the 
part of the younger mages as well, for they can only teach this lesson by 
example.  Should they convince the replacement to return with them to the 
Devourers' realm, they must still get her there safely.  Even as the 
trapped spirit is transferred from one mage to another, the demon 
controlled traitor may choose to strike...



Conversion Notes:  The Devourers would just as well as a pack of elderly
Uktena and Silent Striders for Werewolf players.
