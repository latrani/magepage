   <h2>
    The Eater of Dimensions
   </h2>
   This is a very strange and
  threatening being allied with some Nephandi. It isn't exactly a
  being, more like a whole realm, filled with one single being.
  When it manifests in the Umbra or on Earth, it will use
  Correspondence 4 to open openings between its target and its own
  realm. At first they will look like areas of blackish, rotten
  air, and then holes open up into a space filled with endless
  writhing tentacles. The tentacles are very thin, grey threads
  which whip around and seems to dissolve and reform into air all
  the time.
   <p>
    The Eater seems to want space. It literally eats places, by
  enlarging the holes and dragging the place into itself, where it
  is dissolved. The place just disappears from reality. It isn't
  really interested in matter or humans, so it just crushes them
  and discards the refuse. Often it opens up a hole beside its
  victim, grips it with its tentacles and squeezes him through the
  small opening, and then spits out the gore (often into another
  realm).
   </p>
   <p>
    The Eater seems to lack any personality and greater
  intelligence. It's just a realm which wants to expand forever by
  devouring all other realms. However, it is quite useful for the
  Nephandi to do their dirty work. They just make sure it is
  summoned to a place they want destroyed, and then they can lean
  back and watch. The most common way of making the Eater become
  interested in a place is to place objects (like stones, bottles,
  cars or people) around it in a certain angular pattern, something
  most Nephandi intuitively understand. People with Correspondence
  will notice that the pattern looks strange in some way.

    The tentacles of each opening have wound levels like an
  ordinary human, and if the tentacles are damaged enough, they
  will withdraw and the opening will close. However, damage to the
  opening itself will make it larger, making new tentacles emerge.
  Each wound to the opening itself will heal a wound level to the
  tentacles. To close an opening with magick, Correspondence must
  overcome the Eater's countermagick.

   <h2>
    The Teacher
   </h2>
   The being known as the Teacher has been with
  mankind as long as history. It has been called Lucifer,
  Nyarlathotep, The Black Man and many other things. Its purpose
  seems to be to seduce mages into becoming barabbi, and leading
  Nephandi deeper into alien damnation. It seems to appear as a
  guide to Nephandi who have undergone an Epiphany, and helps (?)
  them in becoming even more alien and inhuman.
   <p>
    Normally the Teacher will appear in a human form. It is
  recognized by its intense aura of might and subtle wrongness.
  From the corner of the eye people might imagine it is surrounded
  by a grey mist, or feel that there is some kind of disharmonious
  sound in the air, just below the threshold of hearing or perhaps
  as ultrasound. The Teacher normally behaves politely, with an air
  of subtle irony and well hidden arrogance. It seldom speaks
  unless asked, and answers in a low, well modulated voice.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, the Teacher will change completely if attacked. It
  never attacks first, but as it is hurt, its body changes. It's
  almost like its human form was a projection on a screen, which
  now is tilted. The Teacher's body seems to turn in some unknown
  direction, losing its perspective and becoming a distorted,
  frightening parody of human. Its perspective is all wrong, limbs
  change shape and angle depending on movement and its voice become
  somehow "angled", it becomes utterly disconcerting and induces
  headaches. In this state, the Teacher will become a horrible
  enemy, ignoring any laws of space or distance, striking people
  from across the room while bullets miss by miles.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Teacher seems never to get angered, it just seems that its
  humanity is a facade, its body a three dimensional projection
  from something far away. While it still behaves and talks like a
  perfect gentleman, it will distort the shape of people and
  objects, bending space into knots and causing enormous paradox
  backlashes. Then it disappears, leaving the survivors to sort
  things out. The Teacher seems to never get permanently hurt
  (since its body is probably just an three dimensional extension
  of a higher dimensional being), and will reappear whenever it
  feels for it. However, it doesn't have any human motivations, and
  won't seek revenge or reprisal against attackers. However, it
  might become interested if somebody seemed to be recruitable.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Teacher teaches secrets beyond man's ken. It knows
  profound truths about the universe and how reality works, but
  these are extremely alien. In order to learn them, the student
  has to become more and more alien to understand them. At first
  it's just mind-bending riddles and weird ideas, but later they
  become more and more drastic and the exercises practical. The
  student has to see reality from more and more alien points of
  view, becoming less and less human. The Teacher is especially
  good at teaching the spheres, especially Correspondence and
  Spirit, and also Cosmology, Enigmas and Occult.

     Roleplaying Tips:
    </b>
    Humans are amusing, even if they
  don't understand it themselves. Play along with their little
  games, and see how many foolish things they will do for you just
  to learn a few, simple facts about the universe. If they become
  irritating, you scare them a bit and walk away.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Some Rotes (using Nephandi-Correspondence):
   </h2>
   <b>
    Bend Space
  (Correspondence 5):
   </b>
   The Teacher can bend the shape of an
  object (like a human arm) into a new shape, and it will remain in
  that condition for a while (or permanently). It is not the object
  itself that is bent, but the space it takes up. A gun with a bent
  barrel will still function perfectly, but the bullets will fly
  quite unpredictably. A bent arm can still be used, but it becomes
  extremely hard to use it since it doesn't move in any reasonable
  way.
   <p>
    [To use an object (like a gun or a sword), the user must
  succeed with intelligence + enigmas against a difficulty of 8
  (more or less depending on circumstances). To use a limb, the
  user must succeed with dexterity + enigmas.]
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Angle (Correspondence 5):
    </b>
    The Teacher hits somebody,
  and makes him rotate a bit out of synch with ordinary space. The
  effect is direct and frightening; everything is still there, but
  somehow angled into new and unexpected shapes. A ball will look
  like an ellipsoid, humans appear as distorted shadows of
  themselves and just walking through a room is a hard task. It is
  quite simple to get lost, and many victims wander off completely
  from normal reality. From the perspective of others, the victim
  appears as warped and angled strangely. The Teacher sometimes
  uses this against its students, forcing them to see the universe
  in a completely new way.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Four Dimensional Kill (Correspondence 5):
    </b>
    The Teacher
  simply makes the space around the victim four dimensional. Blood,
  organs and skeleton start to leak out through the fourth
  dimension, causing a slow and grisly death.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Four Dimensional Grip (Correspondence 3):
    </b>
    The Teacher
  can reach into enclosed spaces and remove items. It is for
  example quite simple for it to reach into someone's stomach and
  knot their guts, or rip out their heart without damaging anything
  else. But by using the bend space effect, it can even remove
  inner organs while they still are doing their work; a removed
  heart will still pump the blood of the victim, a removed brain
  will still think while lying in the hands of the Teacher. This is
  sometimes used by it for some truly weird teachings, where the
  student is more or less disassembled and sent on strange journeys
  in many directions at once.
