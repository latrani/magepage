  <h1>
   The Apostles of Ialdabaoth
  </h1>
  It is an almost universal fact
  that for every tradition of people seeking enlightenment, there
  is a corresponding group of people who reverse the teachings and
  strive for the opposite. The Apostles of Ialdabaoth are the dark
  reflection of all mages seeking spiritual enlightenment; instead
  of striving to put spirit above matter and breaking free from the
  prison of reality, the Apostles encourage everyone to partake in
  the pleasures of the world, forget all higher goals and let
  matter rule spirit.
  <p>
   The Apostles are an ancient and mixed group of mages and
  sleepers, and have existed as organised groups only for brief
  periods of time. They trace their beginnings to the Hellenic era
  in the West, where they opposed the Gnostic enlightenment, and to
  ancient Indian sects which sought to show people the glories of
  living and reincarnating. They incited many heretical Christian
  sects, were influential in the formation of modern Satanism, and
  have successfully corrupted more mages of the Traditions and
  Technocracy than all other Nephandi together. At least that is
  their boast.
  </p>
  <p>
   The basic tenet of their philosophy is the supremacy of
  matter, division and pleasure. They argue that the One created
  the world and split apart into the Pure Ones in order to
  experience it, to learn and revel in being physical and alive.
  Those denying the flesh and the world, trying to transcend it and
  join with the Highest are just trying to leave the party before
  its over. If they really understood the wishes of the Highest,
  they would instead use their powers to take pleasure in the
  world, to continue the great fall from Spirit into Matter. There
  is no need to strive for higher goals, soon enough the Highest
  may decide to call all of the shards of Creation home again, but
  before that, it is their duty to undergo all the transformations,
  pains and pleasures of living.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the West, the Apostles have had great success perverting
  and seducing many young Cultists of Ecstasy, who didn't truly
  understand their tradition's teachings. Instead of using pleasure
  and experience as a tool to break through all illusions and
  joyfully transcend them, they mire themselves down in physical
  pleasures with no higher goal than mere gratification. More
  experienced Cultist do their best to counter the cancer spread by
  the Apostles, with mixed success. Often the Apostles mix with the
  wandering and idiosyncratic cultists, appearing to be normal
  members. This causes painful internal schisms, especially since
  many apprentices and disciples think their mentors are just
  spoil-sports who have lost the spark of enjoyment.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the greatest triumph of the Apostles is the
  corruption of the Technocracy. While they are not responsible for
  all It's atrocities, they have been very successful at poisoning
  the philosophy of the technomancers. Instead of boldly looking
  forward and upward, plotting a path towards Ascension of mankind,
  they are more interested in adding new technologies and sciences
  to the paradigm. They have become petty demiurges themselves. The
  Syndicate is most infected, and has devoted itself to making sure
  the Masses turn from spiritualism to materialism. Many syndicate
  mages have also been blinded by greed and ambition, loosing their
  concern for Ascension in the pursuit of power. The members of the
  other conventions are not as infected, but the entire
  technomancer movement (including the Sons of Ether and Virtual
  Adepts) has been somewhat influenced and blindly move in the
  direction of the Apostles. And through the Technocracy, the
  Apostles has influenced billions of people.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Apostles are of course regarded as enemies of Ascension by
  almost all traditions. The Akashic Brothers and Euthanatos often
  join forces in combating their spread of materialism in Asia.
  Influential members of the Cult of Ecstasy do their best to rid
  their tradition of the disease. The Celestial Chorus zealously
  guards the spiritual purity of itself and its associates (which
  often is mistaken for fanatism and inquisition). However, the
  Sons of Ether and Virtual Adepts regard most of the fear of the
  Apostles as outdated, since technology now gives mankind a way
  out from the world of matter by reshaping it; The world of spirit
  can be built.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Apostles have a complex relation to the Nephandi. Although
  the Traditions regard them as Nephandi, who strive to tempt
  everyone from the path of Ascension, the Apostles do not serve
  any other powers than themselves. This sometimes puts them in
  conflict with the "real" Nephandi, who serve dark outside powers,
  something the Apostles find just as silly as serving the high
  ideals of the Traditions. In fact, the Apostles have seduced many
  Nephandi away from their path to Descension. This have made many
  powerful Nephandi declare the Apostles as their enemies. However,
  there are other groups of Apostles and Nephandi who get along
  quite well, seeing each other as necessary parts of reality.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Technocracy does not regard the Apostles as very important
  at all. The New World Order has simply classified them as mages
  seeking personal gain instead of changing reality, and therefore
  not the kind of direct threat as the Traditions, Marauders or
  Nephandi. Since most Apostles prefer to work in a rather low-key
  way and mainly use coincidental magick, they are no big threat to
  static reality. In fact, the Syndicate has found many promising
  recruits among them.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Apostles are more a philosophy than a real tradition;
  their ideology has independently been rediscovered many times. In
  fact, most groups of the Apostles have never been in contact with
  each other. They don't need to, since they all agree on the
  course: show the world that pleasure and materialism is good and
  rewarding, while spirituality at its best is fruitless. Most
  members are complete hedonists, doing their best to experience
  all kinds of new and exciting vices. They also use their magick
  to gain more wealth and power, finding new ways to acquire them
  without getting caught by Paradox, society, other mages or their
  own conscience. However, pleasure can take many forms and do not
  necessarily have to involve the conventional vices. Many Apostles
  are very keen on travelling and exploring, seeing out beautiful
  and exotic places. They argue, "if they weren't intended to be
  enjoyed, why would they be there?" Other Apostles enjoy more
  intellectual pursuits, like literature and science. Although they
  might appear to seek higher levels, they are really just enjoying
  the works of Man and nature. This fraction has been the most
  successful at infiltrating the Order of Hermes and
  Technocracy.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Apostles have many allies and unwitting pawns. Among the
  spirits, they get along very well with the Hestilcs, which they
  often summon to interact with. They have also some contact with
  the Toreadors, especially the Poseurs. But it is among sleepers
  they have their real influence. Many of the Apostles have
  groupies, followers and admirers who they freely manipulate. They
  often gather economical influence, and some Apostles are
  extremely rich. And since they like to move in the jet-set, they
  tend to know a lot of interesting and important people.
  </p>
  <p>
   What makes the Apostles so insidious is the seductiveness and
  simplicity of their message. They are masters of making mages
  stray from the Path and turn to comfortable and joyous
  stagnation. The worst thing is that even if individual Apostles
  aren't that interested in tempting others, they tend to do it
  anyway just by existing. When young mages ask their mentors why
  the Apostles seem to do so well, and get no satisfactory answer,
  they start to wonder if they really have to put up with all the
  restrictions and formalism of their traditions. And when the seed
  has been planted, it grows...
  </p>
  <h2>
   Philosophy
  </h2>
  Ascension: who cares? Yes, its quite possible
  that you could evolve to perfection and merge with the Godhead
  after a few centuries of meditation and asceticism. Is it really
  worth it? Is that really what you think the universe was created
  for?
  <h2>
   Initiation
  </h2>
  Usually the Apostles gradually introduce
  sleepers to their world and philosophy, showing them unimaginable
  wealth and new pleasures. Those few with the right spark to delve
  right into it are initiated by journeys of pleasure and beauty
  that would impress even the most jaded Cultists of Ecstasy. It
  opens their eyes to the amazing things there is to enjoy in the
  world, and the equally manifold ways a mage can get them.
  <h2>
   Spheres and magick
  </h2>
  The Apostles have no definite main
  sphere. Those who have fallen from a tradition retain their main
  sphere and their foci. Orphans remain orphans. However, since the
  Apostles has close ties to the Cult of Ecstasy, very many members
  are good at Time. Other common spheres are Entropy, Mind and
  Life. Many also begin to use vices as foci for their spheres,
  just out of convenience.
  <p>
   They mainly see the spheres as tools to use for their
  continued enjoyment of the world, and usually don't try to
  understand or master them for their own sake. This, combined with
  the fact that they usually aren't interested in higher matters
  like Ascension, tends to stagnate their magickal development.
  Many Apostles who has left their traditions never develop
  further. Sometimes energetic members make an effort to advance,
  usually to gain more ability to control the Illusion around them,
  but it is uncommon.

   <dd>
    Since everything is essentially one, space is really just a
    temporary result of the division of the One. But we are
    thankful for it. This sphere is good for getting around, spying
    on your enemies and finding new exciting destinations.
   </dd>
   <dt class="c1">
    Entropy
   </dt>
   <dd>
    We are still moving from pure spirit to base matter, and
    Entropy is the obvious result. Everything that is high and
    ordered will sooner or later break down into even lower levels.
    Since the world is filled with randomness and decay, this is
    one of the most potent spheres. Make your own luck, and
    dispatch your enemies or other spoil-sports with decay.

    Forces are the brilliant and loud arpeggios of the symphony

    Life
   </dt>
   <dd>
    There is no doubt that life is the greatest creation of the
    Demiurge. Such an ability to feel, to live, to exist! And we
    can reshape it to new forms, with new abilities to experience
    the world. The Sphere of life is about all the pleasures of the
    flesh.

    Matter

   <dd>
    Pieces of matter is the building blocks of the world, the
    bars of our golden cage. Enjoy their beauty, gather them into
    wealth and reshape those parts of the world which is not to
    your liking.
   </dd>
   <dt class="c1">
    Mind
   </dt>
   <dd>
    Mind is the spark of consciousness the One let descend into
    the world, in order to experience it and remember it. Since all
    minds once were one, what one mind thinks or feels, another
    mind can also think and feel. Our minds give us the ability to
    influence others, to play with emotions and thoughts like the
    toys they are.

    Prime
   </dt>
   <dd>
    Quintessence is the essence of the One, which It shaped
    into the world. Since we fulfil the wishes of the Highest, we
    are also able to reshape the world, to grant existence or
    remove it from things just like the Demiurge we seek to
    mirror.
   </dd>
   <dt class="c1">
    Spirit
   </dt>
   <dd>
    There are a manifold levels of existence, forming a complex
    interlacing web witnessing of the ingenuity of the creator. We
    can travel these other levels and interact with their denizens.
    It might even be possible to use this sphere to return to the
    primordial unity, but that would be rather stupid.
   </dd>
   <dt class="c1">
    Time
   </dt>
   <dd>
    Time is the great curse and boon the Demiurge gave us. It
    makes everything transitory, which ends the pleasure but also
    forces us to seek out new pleasures and experiences. It hides
    what will come and have been to avoid spoiling the fun
    (although this sphere allows us to peek anyway).

  <h2>
   Chantry
  </h2>
  The Apostles have no real chantries. Most are
  solitary or gather in small cliques to enjoy themselves. While
  some gather at brothels, exclusive resorts or on private yachts,
  others prefer to keep moving all the time. A few found various
  sects, ranging from satanic covens and sex-cults to televangelist
  churches.
  <h2>
   Meetings
  </h2>
  They seldom search out each other, simply
  because they don't need to. They have no doctrinal differences to
  settle, no higher aspirations, no seeking of Ascension.

   Other Names
  </h2>
  The Apostles have no central organisation,
  and have no real name for themselves. The name "The Apostles of
  Ialdabaoth" was coined by the Order of Hermes, and is mainly used
  about those Apostles actively corrupting others. The Celestial
  Chorus name them after the gnostic movements they influenced as
  Sarkikes, Hylikes and Borborites. Other common names for them
  are: The Children of Maya, the Worms of the Clay, The Sons of
  Matter, Descenders and The Servants of the Demiurge.

   Quote
  </h2>
  "Let me get this straight. You are seeking
  Ascension in this rat-hole, with no heating and a leaking roof.
  In order to pay the rent you have to take a boring day-job which
  often leaves you too exhausted to do your real work here. But you
  could use your magick with no effort at all to get enough money
  to move to a small mansion where your Seeking wouldn't be
  constantly interrupted by the landlord or the plumbing. Would
  that really be to misuse your powers and stray from the Path, or
  just plain common sense?"
  <h2>
   <a name="rotes">
    Rotes
   </a>
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Perfect the Ecstasy (Life 2 Mind 2)
  </h3>
  This is often used by
  the Apostles to enhance their experience. They go into an altered
  state of consciousness where they experience *everything* as
  different kinds of pleasure; sounds, touch, pain, thought, sorrow
  and sight, all are exciting sensations. The mage will still be
  aware of the outside world, although the pleasure may cloud his
  judgement (after all, in this state a car accident is orgasmic).
  <h3>
   Animal Attraction (Correspondence 2 Mind 2 Life 2)
  </h3>
  This
  fills the mage and a victim with intense sexual attraction to
  each other, both on the mental and physical level. They are
  linked together by a bond of passion, which can only be released
  when they have enjoyed each other. The apostles find this rote
  very useful, since many of their victims latter rationalise their
  behaviour and think they really wanted to give themselves to the
  mage.
  <h3>
   O Fortuna, Imperatrix Mundi (Entropy 2 Time 2 Mind 2)
  </h3>
  By
  linking their subconscious with the flow of randomness and time,
  the Apostles gain an inordinate amount of luck and opportunity.
  They just follow their impulses, and they often turn out to be
  both right and enjoyable.
  <p>
   [ For the duration of the effect, as long as the influenced
  person just follows his or her whims, he or she will be able to
  avoid accidents and irritations, while having good luck and
  stumbling over opportunities.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Prison of Beauty (Mind 3)
  </h3>
  This defensive rote was
  apparently inspired by the weakness of the Toreadors. The Apostle
  simply floods the mind of the victim with the beauty of
  something, be it a flower, a person or just a shadow. The victim
  becomes entranced and forgets everything he or she was doing.
  <h3>
   Haven't I seen you before? (Mind 3 Time 2)
  </h3>
  This is a
  trick the Apostles often use to gain the friendship of
  influential people. By subtly manipulating their memories,
  emotions and sense of time, they can make another person think
  they recognise the mage as a friend, although they don't remember
  when they have met. The mage uses Mind and Time to dredge up
  plausible bits of information, which are used to "remind" him
  ("Don't you remember me James? At Lord Winthorphe's dinner,
  across the table?"). Although the person still won't be able to
  remember them meeting the mage, most people quickly rationalise
  away this and believe he really is an old, if forgotten, friend.
  <h3>
   Enter the world (Correspondence 3 Spirit 2 Mind 1)
  </h3>
  Some
  of the more mystical Apostles seek greater union with the world
  than just enjoying it. This rote is the first step: they expand
  their awareness more and more to all levels of existence, seeking
  to encompass them. Such mages may spend days or even weeks in
  blissful trance as they experience a multitude of sensations.
  <h3>
   Join the World (Correspondence 5 Spirit 5 Mind 5 Prime
  4)
  </h3>
  Some of the most powerful Apostles actually become the
  world. By spreading their consciousness into every part of it, to
  every level, and then dissolving the physical boundaries of their
  bodies, they become an integral part of everything. They can
  experience all pleasure, all pain, everything that happens
  everywhere. Forever. This is the closest thing the Apostles have
  to Ascension.
