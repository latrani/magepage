  <h2>
   The New World Order Operative Handbook
  </h2>
  The handbook is a
  pocket-sized black book, bearing the logo of the NWO and it's
  motto "One World. One Truth. One Reality" in silver on the
  plastic cover (it is surprisingly resilient and will not be
  damaged by even rough handling). Inside are the rules for NWO
  operatives, general Technocracy policy and useful advice in the
  field.
  <p>
   This handbook is a very useful talisman for the Men in Black,
  since in any situation it is easy to look up the official policy
  of the New World Order that applies. Even in very weird
  circumstances the handbook has provided crucial advice, and no
  Man in Black will ever be without his copy (it is rumoured that
  even John Courage keeps his handbook).
  </p>
  <h2>
   Paradigm Bomb
  </h2>
  This device is the result of the crazed
  genius of a group of etherites who wanted to prevent the
  Technocracy or competing mages to find their most dangerous
  secrets. They reasoned that since some things are possible in
  some paradigms but not in others, it would be quite possible to
  build a device that is completely safe in one paradigm but very
  destructive in another.
  <p>
   Their initial experiment was made in reverse; they forced a
  captured progenitor to build a wild contraption from their
  blueprints to compress ether and run it. Of course nothing
  happened, since the progenitor knew that the device was obviously
  ineffectual. But when brought into the presence of an etherite
  the extreme ether-pressure made it blow up (hurting the
  participants rather badly).
  </p>
  <p>
   The next design was offensive; it consists of a simple tank of
  hydrogen, fluorine and catalyst held stable by a field of
  polarised neutrinos. In the presence of someone who doesn't
  accept the polarised neutrinos the stabilisation weakens, and the
  tank explodes in a fine paradox backlash, spreading shrapnel and
  hot fluoric acid over the surroundings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Paradigm bombs have to be built in sanctums, and are usually
  kept at the entrance (leaving them outside will lead to an
  eventual explosion). Unfortunately they are a bit unpredictable,
  since they are primed by belief instead of physical events. It
  was found the hard way that some of the acolytes were too
  sceptical of the whole idea.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some hotheads plan to go on with loading a truck with
  plutonium and sending it by remote control to a technocracy
  construct "just to watch the sparks fly", but more reasonable
  voices have so far prevailed.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Doldr
  </h2>
  This curious device looks like a scarred, heavy
  metal ball, weighing a few kilograms. The material is harder than
  anything known, and it is impervious to most kinds of radiation.
  If someone or something tries to look inside, Doldr will defend
  itself by causing a distraction or preventative event (if a X-ray
  device is used, the power will fail, mages suddenly suffer
  paradox backlashes). A technomancer attempt caused a major
  electrical breakdown in Scandinavia.
  <p>
   Its origin is unknown, but it has been the property of many
  prominent mages. It seems to be the result of very mighty,
  possibly oracular magick. Sometimes Doldr gives advice, usually
  appearing as messages printed on computers in the vicinity, in
  letters with no sender or as brief phone calls when a metallic
  voice firmly tells the listener to do or (more often) don't do
  something. It is believed that Doldr perceives everything that is
  going on around it (and perhaps everything that happens on
  Earth), using all spheres.
  </p>
  <p>
   Master Carrera of the Order of Hermes says that Doldr is tied
  to the forces of Paradox, and seeks to minimise the total amount
  of Paradox in the world. It often warns mages away from acts of
  hubris or suggest acts that may help limit future paradox
  (sometimes at very remote times and places). It might be an
  intelligent entity, but it is not certain.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Dragon Pearl
  </h2>
  According to legend, it was their shining
  magickal pearls that gave Chinese dragons their power; their
  whole existence was concentrated into these pearls. According to
  some stories, knowledgeable dragons could remove their pearl and
  become human, but if they lost the pearl they remained
  human.Later generations of mages have learned their secret: these
  fabulously rare objects are portable nodes, sources of raw
  energy. The dragons are the manifestation of power, the pearls
  are the power.
  <p>
   Many Chinese stories tell how dragon pearls could bring
  abundance; if one was placed in a urn with a little rice the next
  morning the urn would be filled to the brim - and the same thing
  went for money. Actually, this was due to the flow of
  Quintessence from the pearl that manifested as Tass and bountiful
  patterns.
  </p>
  <p>
   But the greatest and most dangerous power of the dragon pearl
  is that it can transform a human into a dragon if swallowed, at
  least according to the myths. The transformation is quite
  painful, the person feels a burning sensation and a horrible
  thirst that forces him to seek out water to slake his thirst. As
  he drinks, he will grow to tremendous size and turn into a
  dragon.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Poisoned Time
  </h2>
  This kind of Marauder artefact is very,
  very rare but highly praised by the Euthanatos Masters (who will
  pay fabulous amounts of Quintessence for it). Some Marauders
  apparently travel through time, drawing future and past paradox
  with them causing irrevocable paradoxes. It seems that some
  entity collects this paradox, concentrates and bottles it into
  small hourglasses. Each hourglass is very small and fragile, just
  a few centimetres high and with elaborate ivory, jade or ebony
  frames. Inside the hourglass poisoned time exists as a kind of
  viscous smoke-liquid instead of sand.
  <p>
   If a hourglass with poisoned time is broken, it will quickly
  dissipate and poison time itself in the vicinity. By just being
  present, everything will be hurt; the passage of time is like
  invisible barbed wire passed through each cell, each moment.
  Fragile objects shatter, living beings suddenly begin to bleed
  and stable objects begin to erode noticeably. The effect lasts of
  a while in the area, and will spread forward in time while
  dissipating. Time mages can often recognise its effects a long
  time afterwards.
  </p>
  <p>
   Adepts of Time can also pour the contents over an event,
  poisoning the event so that anybody involved in it will be hurt.
  The damage done depends on how close they are to the event
  causally, and how many other victims there are. Poisoning an
  election result will have almost no effect whatsoever, while
  poisoning a business meeting will hurt those present and
  poisoning the theft of an artefact will probably just hurt the
  thief.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Chains of Slavery
  </h2>
  These Nephandi talismans are very
  prized by the dark mages, since they help them manage those
  unfortunates they plan to sacrifice to their masters or otherwise
  use in their vile amusements.
  <p>
   The chains are black and cold, numbing to the touch and quite
  heavy. Some versions come with manacles or leg irons, but most
  are simply long chains which bind a victim. Anybody bound by them
  will become docile and have a hard time taking initiatives.
  Thinking about breaking or escaping the chains becomes
  impossible, and orders given by someone holding the other end of
  the chain (or just orders in general) are instantly obeyed.
  </p>
  <p>
   [As long as the victim is bound, his effective willpower is
  five less than normal, reducing most people to docile slaves. The
  difficulties of initiating new actions increase with 3, while
  resisting a given order requires a willpower roll. ]
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Götterdämmerung Device
  </h2>
  This extraordinary
  techno-talisman was built in the 1910's by Professor Gottfried
  Hauf, during the last years of cooperation between the etherites
  and the Technocracy. Professor Hauf had been involved in a joint
  Void Engineer-Etherite project of sanitising or destroying
  tainted or dangerous nodes, a very dangerous challenge. He
  decided to invent something to simplify the process, and
  developed the Götterdämmerung Device (originally known
  as the Reinigung ("Cleaning") Device).
  <p>
   Hauf had realised that nodes could be turned against
  themselves by converting free Quintessence into energy. Drawing
  upon his friend von Neumann's ideas about self-replicating
  machines, he developed a self-replicating magickal pattern. When
  put into a node, the pattern would absorb some quintessence, make
  a number of copies of itself and then begin to transform free
  quintessence into energy. Quickly, the replicating patterns would
  spread and begin to drain the node, which would explode as the
  patterns shifted to energy conversion mode. The Device simply
  projected this pattern into the node from a safe distance.
  </p>
  <p>
   The first attempt in September 1915 on a captured Nephandi
  labyrinth was a total success. Standing on a hill a kilometre
  away, Professor Hauf and his team directed the antenna of the
  device towards the node (hidden in what on the outside looked
  like a normal farm) and activated it. At first nothing happened,
  and even Hauf began to look worried. Then light began to shine
  through the windows, the ground began to tremble and suddenly the
  entire building exploded into a blinding cloud of energy and
  whirling patterns. The following Paradox backlash completely
  eradicated any trace of the Labyrinth.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hauf was happy, but not content. The device could destroy a
  node, but what of its abilities were extended? He began to work
  on a more advanced version, which would drain quintessence from
  all patterns into the replicating force converters. This way its
  strength could be increased a millionfold, and it could even be
  used against other targets than nodes.
  </p>
  <p>
   It was his student Laura von Graunstein who pointed out the
  danger: if used carelessly the replicators would drain
   <i>
    all
   </i>
   normal patterns and spread across the universe like wildfire,
  turning everything into a tempest of wild energy. A true doomsday
  weapon. Hauf wanted to dismiss the whole idea, but his
  calculations convinced him - his new Device was potentially able
  to destroy all of creation at a press of a button.
  </p>
  <p>
   As the etherites broke free from the Technocracy, Hauf
  destroyed his laboratory using his Device and fled. But he
  coudn't bear to destroy the Götterdämmerung Device, so
  he hid it - somewhere. But records still exist, and it is
  rumoured that some technomancers want to find it to once and for
  all destroy the traditions in their realms. And the Nephandi
  would love to get their hands of this Device, for obvious
  reasons.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Device is unassuming, just a black box with a telescope
  antenna and three red buttons beneath a cover marked 'I', 'II'
  and 'III'. I sends out a replicator along the antenna, and if it
  hits a node or other strong concentration of Quintessence (like
  an overcharged mage or talisman) it will begin to replicate,
  destroying the target. II is more sensitive, and will follow
  ley-lines like fuses to other nodes, easily destroying a whole
  chantry or a realm. III is final - it will annihilate the
  universe.
  </p>
  <p>
   [The first turn, the device will do 1 dice of aggravated
  damage to the target (node, mage or talisman). The next 2, then
  4, 8, 16... until all Quintessence points have been drained (this
  can be "soaked" with antimagick). When used on a node the
  resulting explosion, quintessence drain and paradox backlash will
  destroy it utterly. ]
