   The Böhm Institute
  </h1>
  The institute is one of the
  premier organisations devoted to the study of neurochemistry in
  the world. It was founded in 1889 by the famous (if
  controversial) neurologist Konrad Böhm for the study of
  neural disorders and their treatment. Through the years it has
  served both as an exclusive sanatorium for the very rich and as a
  laboratory for neuroscientific research.
  <p>
   What isn't completely apparent is that it is run by the Sons
  of Ether. Konrad Böhm was himself convinced that by
  manipulating the electrochemical flows of the brain any mental
  disease could be cured, and his successors (the Institute is now
  run by his grandson, Frank Böhm) have continued this
  neurochemical research well beyond his wildest imagination. At
  the same time the Institute is very careful about its scientific
  respectability, and many of the papers its researchers have
  produced are today among the most often cited in their areas. In
  fact, several times Progenitors have visited and returned quite
  impressed with the impeccable work done here.

  <p>
   The Institute is located just outside Geneva (although it has
  several smaller offices and research labs in the city proper) in
  a small white building with several annexes surrounded by a
  pleasant garden. It is actually comfortably small, and everybody
  knows everybody. On the top floor Dr Böhm and his
  administration resides, the second floor contains laboratories
  and the first floor is reception. In the various annexes the rich
  patients live (the rooms are airy and more reminiscent of a hotel
  than a neurological institute), in addition to a few more
  laboratories.
  </p>
  <p>
   The research done here is all directed towards unlocking the
  keys of neurochemistry for various purposes. One use is of course
  to cure various diseases such as schizophrenia, depression,
  Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, but another goal is
  to find a way to make the human mind grow to its full potential.
  Researchers have already found certain hormones that can make
  neurones grow more synapses, possibly increasing intelligence,
  and a psychoactive drug which seems to facilitate the
  understanding of dynamic reality for sleepers. Dr. Böhm is
  himself involved in a project directed towards total control of
  the hypothalamic centres, hoping to find a way to control all
  primitive urges hidden in the human brain, from sexuality and
  rage to the sense of time.
