     Authors note: I've always been dissatisfied with the way Do
  was presented in the various Mage books. The emphasis is always
  on the martial asspects of Do, as if it were nothing more than a
  good way to beat people up. Other pople have done some excellent
  write-ups on different styles of Do, and while I found them very
  useful they still didn't satisfy me. I've always thought of Do as
  being much more all-encompassing. So, following is my first
  attempt to write this up into some single cohesive
  system.

       Do is not what you think.

          Introduction
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         Do is not about hurting people. Do is about how you move, how
  you breathe, how you think. It is the ability to act in the most
  correct way in any given situation. It is the ability to see the
  beauty in everything, and to find those things which detract from
  that beauty and correct them. Do is simply the Way. It is the
  process by which a person can act, react think and exist in the
  best way. A Doist never goes out of his way to do anything, if he
  is doing something in a particular place at a particular time, it
  is because that is the way it is supposed to be. It is training
  your body to exist in the most harmonious form. It is training
  your mind to be constantly aware of everything and nothing at the
  same time. Do affects every part of the Doist's life, but it does
  so in such a way that most people never notice it.
         <br>
          <br>
           Do can be used to cause great damage to just about anything or
  anyone. It can also be used for flower arranging, painting,
  sculpture, music performance or composition, dance, animal
  training and many, many other things. To the true master, there
  is no part of his life that is not influenced by his knowledge of
  Do. If this were pointed out to him, he would either be very
  surprised that an outsider would see things that way, or he would
  be very blase about it. A true master essentially forgets Do, it
  has become such a way of life for him that it ceases to influence
  his thoughts. He no longer thinks about what he does, he simply
  does it and allows the Do to flow through him to insure the
  correctness of his actions.

               Do affects the practicioner in many ways, many of which the Doist
  is unaware. As tehy progress through the Ranks their movement
  styles change so they are expending the least possible amount of
  energy to gain the maximum effect. They walk in an almost gliding
  style, lifting their feet as short a distance from the floor as
  possible. Their arms swing only very slightly and their eyes seem
  unfocused as they try to take in everything around them rather
  than concentrating on specific details. Their breathing rate
  becomes slower and deeper. They move their eyes rather than their
  entire head. A Doist will avoid cracks in the sidewalk, or roots
  along a trail, without being aware they are doing so. A Master of
  Do can run through the forest in the middle of the night and
  never disturb a single branch. They almost never trip, bang their
  shins or drop a glass.
               <br>
                <br>
                 Doists often have regular, if peculiar, workout schedules. Their
  exercises are usually uniquely suited to them in order to fully
  devleop every part of their body equally. They tend to be very
  short sessions, seldom lasting longer than 30 minutes, and are
  exhausting for just about anyone other than another Doist.
                 <br>
                  <br>
                   The home of a Do practicioner looks very strange, at first
  glance, to the uninitiated. There are usually very few pieces of
  furniture and little to interrupt walkways. Windows and large
  airy rooms are common, as are plants. Mirrors are frequently
  placed throughout the home to give unimpeded line of sight
  through the dwelling. After only a short time in a Doist's home
  people feel very comfortable and often wonder why things felt
  strange at first. Color schemes are a matter of individual taste,
  they are usually colors that would seem to be of great contrast
  at first but upon longer examination are found to be very
  complementary.

                       Doists don't think the same way most people do. They make jumps
  in their thought processes that are hard to follow and are, in
  hindsight, absolutely correct. They go for the most direct route
  possible to a given destination. A Doist will often find the
  correct answer to a logic problem, but do so in a way that no one
  has ever thought of before.

          Do affects the way the brain interprets various sensory input. A
  Doist can often tell when someone is faking an injury or an
  accent. They can tell when food is done cooking simply from the
  smell and are the ones who have the pitcher of water ready as
  soon as someone empties their glass.

            Because Do can be used in so many different ways it does not
  follow the normal rules for skill purchase or advancement. A
  beginning character may only purchase a maximum of two dots in
  Do. Advancement is 1.5 times the normal cost per dot. For each
  dot a character has in Do he may use his Do score in place of his
  normal skill. This applies to all Skills and Abilities and some
  Knowledges, e.g. Cosmology, Herbal Lore etc. Do may be applied to
  any Skill or Ability ranging from Athletics to Flower Arranging,
  Brawl to Calligraphy and everything in between. However, he must
  have at least one dot in the skill to be replaced. For example, a
  character with three dots in Do may choose to use his Do skill
  instead of his skill levels in any three other skills. He may
  choose Brawl, Melee and Dance for the skills to be replaced, but
  he must have one dot in each of those three skills already. This
  may seem like a tremendous bonus to Doists, but there is one
  major drawback. Because Do is a basic understanding of the way
  the world works around the practicioner his Do skill may never
  exceed his Arete. Further limits may be applied at the
  Storyteller's discretion, such as not allowinbg the character's
  Do score to exceed the score in the character's primary Sphere
  (this is not necessarily the Tradition's primary Sphere, just the
  character's e.g. a member of the Akashic Brotherhood's Scales of
  the Dragon might have Correspondence as his primary Sphere, not
  Mind.) Advancement in Do is not a simple mater. It often involves
  a great deal of time spent is study and meditation, as well as a
  lot of practical application. It also means that a Master of Do
  is probably exceedingly powerful in other areas as well.

             <br>
              The primary practicioners of Do are the Akashic Brotherhood, and
  they are typically the only ones who are able to teach it to
  others. Within the Brotherhood, each sect has different skills
  they emphasize in their teachings. The Scales of the Dragon
  usually use Do with Melee, Tracking, Stealth, Blind Fighting,
  Athletics and other very physical skills. The Orange Robes
  typically use Cosmology, Awareness, Meditation and related
  skills. The Blue Skins employ things like Scrounge,

  to be replaced, is Brawl.

                 Do as a martial art is very different from most other forms.
  While some teachings carry over from one practicioner to the
  next, each individual has his own particualr style of combat. The
  basics of Do are taught to all students and they then modify each
  technique to best suit their own abilities. A large, muscular
  practicioner is not going to fight in the same manner as a
  smaller, more slender one. Though they both might use the same
  type of attacks, one might rely on sheer, brute strength to
  damage their opponent while the other goes for very carefully
  placed strikes to their opponent's nerve clusters. Each is
  equally effective, but very different styles are called
  for.

           As the Doist progresses, her attacks become much more fluid and
  less conscious. At Rank 1, the Doist is constantly aware of what
  she is doing and where the next blow is going to land. She has
  learned how to best use Do for herself but does not yet truly
  understand. At Rank 3 she becomes less conscious of what she is
  actually doing, a Rank 3 Doist may use a Block or Counter as well
  as a Hand or Foot Strike with her full Dice Pool in the same
  round. At Rank 4 the Doist starts to become fully aware of
  herself and her place in the world, she may use two Blocks or
  Counters in the same round. When Rank 5 is reached true Mastery
  of the self is achieved, at this point the Doist is, at best,
  vaguely conscious of what she is doing. She simply sets herself a
  task for the battle (kill a specific opponent, protect the people
  trying to get away, etc.) and lets the Do use her as is proper to
  accomplish that task. A Rank 5 Doist may use any two maneuvers in
  a single round. Note that the multiple attacks/defenses may also
  be used with a weapon provided that the Doist has taken Melee as
  a skill and the wepon is physically capable of the actions
  attempted.
           <br>
            <br>
             Those who achieve Rank 6, Grand Master, in Do are truly awesome
  to see in action. They are unaware of what action they are going
  to take until it has already been performed, they seem to never
  be watching any of their opponents yet are always ready to defend
  against an attack launched from any side. Their own attacks are
  unnoticed except when their opponent suddenly falls. Very few
  Doists ever achieve this rank, and it should be considered only
  slightly less difficult to accomplish than achieving Rank 6 in a
  Sphere. At this point a Doist can perform up to four Do maneuvers
  in a single round. Further progression has never been
  recognized.

                 Do Instruction is a separate skill from both Do and Instruction.
  Because Do itself is such an abstract idea instruction in it
  requires very specific methods of teaching and the ability to
  modify that teaching to match each individual student. A teacher
  with one dot in Do Instruction can teach students who already
  have one dot in Do, Rank three allows the teacher to begin
  instruction with those who show an affinity for Do, e.g.
  neophytes to the Akashic Brotherhood, particularly skilled
  martial artists, Magi with an Arete of 4 or greater. Rank 5
  allows the teacher to instruct anyone, Sleepers, Technomancers
  and even some Marauders.
                 <br>
                  <br>
                   Do is seldom taught to anyone outside the Akashic Brotherhood,
  but there are always exceptions. Dreamspeakers show a particular
  aptitude for learning Do, as do some Cultists of Ecstasy. Orphans
  are occasionally instructed in order to help them realize their
  full potential. The one group that will never be taught are the
  Euthanatos. Any Brother found teaching Do to them faces immediate
  expulsion from the Brotherhood and possible Gilgul.
                   <br>
                    <br>
                     On very rare occasions a Doist may instruct other supernatural
  creatures in the arts of Do. Garou are the fewest, by far. Their
  rage interferes with the smooth flowing nature of Do. Thus far
  only a handful of Stargazers have mastered themselves enough to
  learn even the basics. Wraiths are seldom taught after their
  death, and even fewer have learned it in life (If you have truly
  learned Do, you have come to accept your death as natural.) No
  brother has ever been around a Changeling long enough to teach
  them anything, at least as far as the Brotherhood knows.

         Vampires are a very special case.
         <br>
          <br>
           Vampires have the patience and willpower necessary to devote
  considerable amounts of time to Do. While their initial reasons
  for doing so are usually so they can gain an upper hand in
  physical confrontations, Do has a much greater effect on them as
  they progress. As the Vampire comes to accept himself for what he
  truly is, he finds his thirst for blood tapering off. The normal
  expenditure of 1 blood point per day drops to 1/2 days at Rank 2,
  1/4 days at Rank 3, 1/8 days at Rank 4, and 1/16 days
           <br>
            at Rank 5. It is theorized among some magi that Rank 6 would
  eliminate the Vampire's need for fresh blood entirely. However,
  since no Vampire is known to have progressed beyond Rank 3, this
  theory remains pure speculation. It should be noted that very,
  very few Vampires are ever given the opportunity to learn Do.
  Most Akashic Brother find the idea of feeding on a human and
  thereby weakening them so they do not have the opportunity
  realize their full potential particularly objectionable.

                Magick is often used to enhance a Doists skills. One of the first
  things Akashic Brothers are taught is a variation on the Virtual
  Adpets' Multi-Tasking rote. This allows them to meditate while
  performing katas to strengthen the body and can also be applied
  to using a magickal effect while launching a physical attack at
  the same time
                <br>
                 <br>
                  It is not unusual for Akashic Brothers to also use Forces to
  increase the amount of kinetic energy behind an attack, use a
  Static Discharge style effect to stun an opponent, and Fists of
  Flame is required learning for those who expect to be in conflict
  with Vampires.
                  <br>
                   <br>
                    The Akashic Brotherhood is one of the very few groups to have
  ever turned one of the Technocracy's weapons against them so
  effectively. The advent of motion pictures and the subsequent
  release of innumerable martial arts movies has given the
  Brotherhood a substantial base of Mythic Threads from which to
  operate. Incredible feats of jumping, tumbling and dodging are
  accepted as impressive, but not unnatural. They can use Life
  magick to accept incredible amounts of damage and explain it away
  with 'rigorous training'. A Brother dressed all in black can drop
  a smoke bomb and use Correspondence to Co-Locate himself away and
