Okay, so it's a tiny little bit delayed...  I'm finally getting around to
all-err, make that _some_ of the things I promised to have done ages ago.
		
			BLOODY CARD
			For the WoD

	These strange and unpredictable techno-talismans have a reputation   
out of proportion to their actual use.  Though they _are_ deadly, the side 
effects have kept them from being common.  Their orgin is unknown, though
legend does link them to a pair of female Euthanatoi-who-fail-to-get-the- 
point.  It is more likely that they were a product of an Iteration X mage 
who was deep into Quiet, or that they were NWO prototypes that failed to 
make the cut.  In any case, the standard reccomendation is to _threaten_ 
to use them, not actually use them

DESCRIPTION:  The Bloody Cards are in fact cards, the size of a large 
business card, and about twice as thick.  The edges however are razor 
thin, with microthin slots above the edge.  The cards are heavy for their 
size, and generally are imprinted with a logo.  A patch on the card is 
actually a touch sensitive keyboard.

OPERATION:  Though easy to operate, the cards are difficult to operate 
accuratly.  Basically, the user activates the card and throws it: the 
micro-vectored thrust engines on the edges of the card will sustain it in 
hovering flight for up to two hours at a time.  A combination of pressure 
on the touch pad on the card, combined with wrist angle can cause the 
card to go through a number of pre-programmed flight patterns- though it 
allways returns to the thrower.  
	As was stated before, accuracy is a problem.  It takes much 
practice and skill to get an accurate flight (a specialty is good), and 
due to the sharpness of the card, incidental damage can be considerable.  
Caution in usage is advised.


GAME USAGE:  Note: there are a _lot_ of ways to do these suckers, this is 
just one way.  I also diden't do the extra cost bit from the BoS, 'cause 
i don't like those rules.....

  Level 4 Talisman, Arete 20.  Forces 4 lets it stay in the 
Air, Matter 3 lets it ignore armor, Correspondance 1 lets it be thrown in 
various pre-programmed area-effect patters (need three activation 
successes). Damage is 7 dice..

However, a to hit role using Mele or Thrown Weapons is neccesarry to hit 
all targets.  Another roll is needed to catch the darn thing.  It can be 
programmed to return the next trun, or you can split your dice pool to 
catch it in the same round...if you miss, it will loop around and 'try 
again'-unless you botch or the next rule comes into play.... 
 
SIDE EFFECT:  An incidental Entropy 2 flaw is built in: when activating, 
role aret against a difficulty of 7.  If successful, the Bloody Card will 
deviate in some unfortunate manner, ranging from  missing the target or 
the return, to accidently splitting open a Natural Gas tank or canister 
of Sarin.  Caution is advised....
