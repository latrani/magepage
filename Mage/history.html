  <h1>
   Swedish History from a Mage Perspective
  </h1>
  <h2>
   The Prehistory and the Age of Vikings
  </h2>
  Sweden has never
  been a real centre for magick. Like most other parts of the world
  there have been mages, but they have been few and far between.
  Probably the oldest mages were groups like the Dreamspeakers and
  Verbena, helping the people survive the harsh climate in the
  north, protecting them from the Unknown and helping with the
  crops, fishing and hunting. It was a very utilitarian magick,
  with more practical uses than metaphysical. While the mages in
  the civilised lands in the south were already creating great
  philosophical systems and struggling to bring their Ascension to
  their peoples, the northern mages had to bargain with the spirits
  to obtain food and used their magick to protect their people from
  wild animals and worse.
  <p>
   The worship of the old gods seems to have been influenced by
  the
   <a href="Mage/asatru.html">
    Verbena
   </a>
   . During the ceremonies at the temple of Uppsala
  animals and thralls were hanged in great oaks, and the priests
  sprinkled the idols of the gods with the blood from the
  sacrifices. Afterward everybody celebrated, to ensure continued
  fertility and good crops.
  </p>
  <p>
   During this time some kinds of magic was used by people on a
  rather regular basis, almost like we today use technology. The
  magic was relatively minor, and often of protective nature to
  protect against spirits, the faeries, the dead, injuries,
  accidents and bad luck. The
   <a href="Mage/asatru.html#RUNES">
    runic alphabet
   </a>
   was regarded as magical, and to be able to
  inscribe runes was regarded as a kind of magic. Another type of
  magic was the
   <a href="Mage/asatru.html#GALDERS">
    galders
   </a>
   , songs sung in a high pitched voice. All in all,
  minor magic seems to have been quite common, supported by the
  Verbena.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the northern region of Scandinavia the Lapps lived. They
  were a nomadic people of reindeer herders. Their shamans, the
  nojds, were reputed to be both powerful and dangerous. While most
  magic were regarded as rather acceptable by the Vikings ("A brave
  man with a good sword can take tackle most things - including
  magic"), the magick of the Lapps was regarded with suspicion and
  fear.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Christianity and the Middle Ages
  </h2>
  Year 829 AD a monk named
  Ansgar arrived in Sweden. He was sent out by emperor Ludwig to
  convert the Vikings of Sweden to Christianity (perhaps to lessen
  their raids and make them easier to trade with). The attempt
  failed, but soon other missionaries arrived. The Celestial Chorus
  were probably among them, and a struggle ensued between the Pagan
  Verbena and the Christian Choristers. The struggle continued for
  several centuries, but Christianity slowly became the religion of
  the kings and leaders and later the rest of the inhabitants. Both
  groups adapted to each other, and it seems as the Verbena went
  underground and continued their activities with support from the
  people, while the Choristers left them and their beliefs more or
  less alone.
  <p>
   During the middle ages Sweden became more unified. A few small
  crusades was sent out against the Pagans in the East, with
  dubious religious but rather good economic success, and Finland
  became a part of Sweden. Sweden slowly became more and more a
  part of the rest of Christendom, and the catholic hierarchy
  become as influential as it is in the rest of Europe. But the
  Verbena still exist in secret, supporting the common people
  against the nobility. And in the deep forests the faeries and
  other beings hold sway.
  </p>
  <h2>
   <a name="VASA">
    Gustav Vasa and the Reformation
   </a>
  </h2>
  During
  the 14th century Sweden and Denmark became more and more
  intertwined in their politics, both as enemies and as friends. In
  1389, Queen Margareta became the queen of a union of Denmark,
  Norway and Sweden. The German merchants of the Hansa disliked
  this union, since it could control the trade through the Baltic
  sea completely, and did their best to disrupt it. Inside the
  union there were forces which wanted to break it up, and several
  uprisings took place. When king Christian II ordered the
  Stockholm Bloodbath in 1520 to crush the last members of one of
  the most successful revolts, he only fuelled the hatred against
  the union both among the general populace and the nobility. A
  young nobleman, Gustaf Eriksson Vasa, incited a general uprising
  against the unionists.
  <p>
   During the time, on the continent the Technomancers had
  emerged. Using the invention of the printing press they had
  spread their technology far and wide, and had started the
  Reformation to finally crush the power of the Celestial Chorus.
  Some Technomancers had taken control over the emerging trading
  houses, and had become interested in the backward Sweden. When
  Gustaf Vasa asked the merchants of Lübeck for help, they
  gave him both economical and military support. They also sent one
  or two technomancers to Sweden. With the help from them, Gustaf
  Vasa succeeded in becoming king of Sweden in 1523. One of the
  technomancers, Olaus Petri, an ex-chorister who had by converted
  Luther, had been present in Sweden a few years, and quickly got
  the ear of the king.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Reformation quickly and efficiently gave the king much
  control over the Church, and the technomancers silently and
  ruthlessly destroyed the power-base of the Celestial Chorus
  without anybody noticing. Gustaf Vasa also began to tie the power
  closer to the king and his bureaucracy, which led to a
  centralised power in Stockholm. He actually imported
  administrators from Germany, and there were doubtless several
  additional technomancers among them. One, Georg Norman, travelled
  around in some provinces, appointed and deposed local
  administration, interrogated priests, confiscated relics, taxes
  and artworks, apparently to root out influences of the
  Chorus.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the death of Gustaf Vasa followed a period where the
  remaining choristers and different factions of technomancers
  fought each other. They manipulated different nobles and
  political factions, sometimes using rather heavy-handed methods
  (which perhaps contributed to the eventual insanity of Erik XIV,
  the eldest son of Gustaf Vasa). The technomancers managed to
  create a state- controlled church in 1592, but the choristers
  controlled the new king Sigismund who was Catholic.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Technocracy managed to quickly outmanoeuver him and forced
  him into exile, and installed Duke Karl Vasa, the youngest son of
  Gustaf Vasa, as king instead. Karl IX turned out to be completely
  loyal to the technomantic cause, and the choristers political
  power was finally completely destroyed. The new king continued
  the efforts of his father, and encouraged the development of new
  technology and the immigration of the Vallons, Dutch experts on
  metallurgy. Among them a few pre-Iteration X members arrived and
  started their work. Under Karl IX, Swedish control and taxation
  expanded northward, and the Lapps were persecuted by the Church
  and state. The Church confiscated their magic drums and did its
  best to convert them to Christianity and destroy all pagan
  elements in their culture. Thus the Technocracy managed to almost
  destroy the Dreamspeakers of the north.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Sweden as a Local Power
  </h2>
  On the continent the 30-year war
  erupted in 1618, when Order of Hermes and the Celestial Chorus
  finally united against the Technocratic threat of the
  Reformation. The technomancer controlled Protestants in Germany
  suffered setbacks, and the Technocracy in Sweden decided to help
  them. King Gustaf II Adolf quickly captured several important
  cities in northern Germany and Poland. With him he had Axel
  Oxenstierna, quite possibly one of the highest ranking and most
  influential technomancers in Sweden at the time. He subtly
  manipulated the king and led the Swedish technomancers in the
  war. On the opposing side was the Celestial Chorus in the Church,
  Order of Hermes controlled nobles and the Verbena, who has
  reacted to the technomantic invasion and general destruction of
  the land. Finally, after a long series of Swedish victories, the
  king is killed by the Verbena in 1632. During the Battle of
  Lützen, they spread thick fog and using their magick lure
  the king away from his army (where the technomancers can protect
  him) and kill him. However, the Verbena had overrated the
  importance of the king, and it did not disturb the plans of the
  technomancers very much. In 1635 Oxenstierna negotiated
  personally with Cardinal Richelieu, and Sweden was yielded
  several German cities and substantial revenues in exchange for a
  withdrawal. During the time, the war degenerated into plundering
  and chaos, as the different factions fought each other. Old
  allies turned on each other, and the union between the traditions
  dissolved.
  <p>
   The only daughter of Gustaf II Adolf, Christina, was too young
  to be crowned after his death, and Oxenstierna appointed a
  committee to rule Sweden in her place. In practice, the
  Technomancers gained total power and Oxenstierna controlled them.
  Another important technomancer at this time was the wealthy Dutch
  merchant Louis de Geer, who in 1627 arrived in Sweden. He was
  probably the representative of the Syndicate, and even before he
  arrived in Sweden he had substantial control over the economy. He
  was given control over the production of weapons and the mining
  industry by the Technocracy. Under his direction the Vallons
  modernised it and made the Swedish iron production extremely
  profitable.
  </p>
  <p>
   Queen Christina turned out to be interested in art and
  science, and she summoned many learned men, philosophers and
  artists to her court. Some of them may have been summoned by the
  ruling technomancers. Among them was René Descartes, the
  French Philosopher and a probable Technomancer. At first he was
  unwilling to go, but the queen threatened him and he finally
  accepted her offer and travelled to Sweden. After a short time in
  the country he developed pneumonia and died. The event is
  shrouded in mystery. Why did the queen or technomancers summon
  him? And why was he unwilling to go? Perhaps Descartes had
  angered the Swedish Technocracy in some way. Perhaps somebody
  else killed him, or it was just a coincidence.
  </p>
  <p>
   How much did Queen Christina really know? It is quite possible
  that she knew something about what was really going on, and who
  the real rulers were. She seems to have decided that she didn't
  want to be the figurehead of the Technocracy, and in 1654 she
  surprisingly abdicated, converted to Catholicism and emigrated to
  Rome. The Technocracy didn't do anything, It just installed her
  cousin Karl X on the throne and went on with Its ambitions to
  create a great- Sweden. However, this meets with more and more
  opposition from other nations (and presumably their
  technomancers).
  </p>
  <p>
   During this time the witch-hunts reached their climax.
  Apparently the Technocracy was doing its best to destroy any
  remaining Verbenas and any contact with the faerie. In 1676 there
  was a veritable witchhunt-epidemic in Stockholm. However, Doctor
  Urban Hiärne, a hermetic mage or technomancer, started to
  defend the alleged witches and show how many testimonies against
  them were made up. The result was that the judges started to
  reconsider, and soon the witch-hunt ended. Why Hiärne
  defended the alleged witches is unknown. One theory is that he
  made a deal with the Verbena, and in exchange received some of
  their medical secrets. His tincture "Hiärnes Droppar" was
  rumoured to cure most diseases and halt ageing.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the expansion of Sweden the finances of the state
  became worse and worse, trade and farming shrunk and the
  Syndicate became more and more opposed to continued expansion.
  But the New World Order wanted to make Sweden into a great
  military power to control northern Europe and finally crush all
  opposition directly. The Swedish Technocracy became divided
  between the expansionist faction, led by the New World Order, who
  wanted to continue their dream of "Greater Sweden", and the other
  faction, led by the Syndicate, who wanted to create a more stable
  system. At first they just quarrelled about it, but later the
  struggle became more violent. Shortly after the death of king
  Karl XI, the royal palace (probably housing the central New World
  Order) was destroyed in a fire. Other, more subtle means were
  used as the factions battled each other while on the surface
  still cordial. The expansionist supported king Karl XII in his
  war against Russia, and initially it worked quite well. But the
  expansionists, trying to prove themselves, overextended
  themselves (possibly this was even supported by the Syndicate,
  which controlled the supply lines and the Progenitors, who spread
  diseases). After the catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Poltava
  1709 they started to loose control, and their "Greater Sweden"
  crumbled. Finally, in 1718 at the Siege of Fredriksten, the king
  was killed by a bullet (which may or may not have been fired by a
  Swede). The expansionists had been totally defeated, and the more
  liberal groups in the Technocracy gained power.
  </p>
  <h2>
   "The Age of Freedom" and King Gustaf III
  </h2>
  After the defeat
  of the New World Order, the Syndicate gained power. They made
  sure the power of the regent was diminished, to minimise the risk
  of anybody using him or her as the expansionists did. They put
  the power into the parliament, which they controlled. Sweden
  became a democracy, at least on the paper.
  <p>
   During this period trade started to flourish, and the
  technologically and scientifically inclined conventions like
  Iteration X and Progenitors started to work seriously. During
  this time the Sons of Ether began to grow, closely allied to the
  conventions. Two important Sons of Ether, Christoffer Polhem and
  Emanuel Swedenborg started to tame the rivers of Sweden and
  developed new methods for mining. Swedenborg however turned out
  to be a bit too unorthodox, and after starting to believe in
  spirits he was forced into exile and died. This led to a schism
  among the Sons, which split into the School of Polhem which was
  loyal to the Technocracy, and the School of Swedenborg which
  opposed or ignored them.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another very important technomancer was Carl von Linné,
  a Progenitor who developed a classification system for plants and
  animals, turning biology into an exact science. He surrounded
  himself with his students, who he sent out in the world to
  catalogue every species. He, and many of his students, have
  influenced biology immensely, turning it into the right direction
  for the Progenitors.
  </p>
  <p>
   <a name="GUSTAF_III">
    The New World Order had not given up
  their plans of creating a
   </a>
   strong central power directly under
  their control, as opposed to the polycracy the Syndicate had
  created. In 1772 king Gustaf III, supported by the NWO seized
  power in a bloodless coup de etat, and reinstalled monarchy. The
  new regime was on the surface quite liberal, but underneath the
  NWO had almost total power. They tried to bring Sweden closer to
  the rest of Europe, especially France. They imported French
  culture and thinking, and started to spread the thinking of the
  enlightenment against the Traditions. However, the king was
  killed by an assassination in 1792, and the external
  power-structure of the NWO collapsed. This time it was probably
  the Traditions who were behind the assassination, thinking that
  by removing the King they would break the power of the
  Technocracy for good. This was only half successful, as the
  Syndicate started to gain power, but it created a short breathing
  space for the Traditions.
  </p>
  <p>
   <a name="KARL">
    The Traditions did their best to gain political
  power. Gustav IV
   </a>
   Adolf, the son of the king, was not yet old
  enough to become king, so his uncle Karl became regent. The
  Rosicrucians had already approached him discreetly and made him
  interested in the occult sciences and freemasonry through their
  man Reuterholm, one of their acolytes. They hoped to use the
  power-structure the Technocracy had created and their ruler to
  gain control over the nation and then reshape it. However, the
  Traditions quickly found out the hard way that they were complete
  novices in real politics, that the people disliked Karl and his
  assistant Reuterholm and that their man turned out to be a rather
  weak leader. There was more to running a nation than just
  controlling the ruler. In 1796 Gustav IV Adolf became king, and
  the Traditions lost their feeble power-base completely.
  </p>
  <p>
   The chaos behind the scenes was aggravated by the chaos caused
  by the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars on the
  continent. The Technocracy began reshaping Europe on a large
  scale, and their orders had to be obeyed by the local
  administrations. As a part of the New World Order long-range plan
  to create a powerful, centralised Russia, the Swedish technocracy
  had to allow Sweden to loose Finland to Russia 1808. It became
  apparent that the Swedish Technocracy was now in the minor
  league. The Syndicate and New World Order quarrelled. These
  problems, coupled to the economic crisis (caused by the wars and
  manipulations of the Syndicate) led after a bloodless coup, a few
  forced abdications and a few "accidents" and killings to a new
  form of government. The Syndicate and New World order finally
  settled their differences, made an easily controllable former
  French military king and started to restore their work. They
  started the industrialisation process, began to build a powerful
  infra-structure and decreased the power of the kings, to avoid
  the possibility of any more Tradition attempts to subvert their
  power.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Industrial Revolution
  </h2>
  During the 19th century the
  Technocracy started to reshape Sweden completely, using the
  industrialism as a cover. They began by building channels, and
  the Göta-channel project was the crowning achievement in
  this phase. It connected the eastern and western parts of Sweden,
  giving some economical and military advantages. But it also
  spread the knowledge of modern technology and management to the
  people, thus laying the foundations of more progress. The
  Railroads became the cornerstone of the development. By building
  railroads, they brought the different parts of Sweden closer
  together, thus starting to remove differences between them. They
  also neatly replaced the natural ley-lines with more efficient
  ones, leading straight to Stockholm and other large cities. The
  fey became hindered by the web of iron, and around the railroads
  new communities grew up, designed completely by the Technocracy.
  By developing the timber and mining-industry, they could spread
  their technology even in the more backward regions. By making the
  population grow, they forced people into the cities and the
  industry, increasing the numbers of believers in their reality.
  <p>
   They also slowly moved Sweden towards democracy, since it was
  the best way to make sure that no troublesome individuals could
  ever interfere with the power-structure. The Traditions seemed do
  be permanently defeated, except maybe the attempts of the
  Celestial Chorus to start religious revivals. During this time
  the Syndicate, School of Polhem and New World Order cooperated
  perfectly. It was a time for optimism and dreams for the
  Technocracy.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Social Movements and the People's Home
  </h2>
  Around the end
  of the century the Technocracy began to realise that the
  opposition was still active, not only from the Traditions but now
  also from concerned Sleepers. Their sometimes rather heavyhanded
  methods and the quick changes caused social upheavals and
  instability. Urbanisation caused epidemics, poverty and social
  chaos. The workers were beginning to organise themselves into
  unions in opposition of their employers.
  <p>
   This was in fact expected by some of the more farsighted
  groups, who planned to use it. People had already started to
  organise themselves into religious or political movements, the
  temperance movement, the popular literacy movement or workers
  unions. A subgroup among the New World Order, the
   <a href="Mage/social_engineers.html">
    Social Engineers
   </a>
   , started manipulating things and effectively
  controlled the different movements. By playing them off against
  each other, encouraging some of them, disrupting others and by
  rewarding those groups which suited their needs with success and
  social change, they made more people than in any other country
  organise themselves into various organisations pressuring for
  different changes. The sleepers learned their lesson, and knew
  that to change society they had to organise themselves, single
  individuals were simply too powerless against the state,
  corporations and other organisations. The Social Engineers
  removed people from politics and replaced them with
  organisations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Social Engineers, and thus the whole of New World Order,
  gained tremendous power through this. The Traditions lost control
  over their organisations and found that their ideals became
  subverted by the Technocracy. Of some reason the NWO decided to
  end the union between Sweden and Norway (probably because they
  wanted a more efficient local organisation instead of the clumsy
  union bureaucracy), and in 1905 Norway seceded from Sweden
  without any problems, a demonstration of the power and control of
  the Social Engineers. By controlling the more and more powerful
  unions and the other groups, they had a stranglehold on the
  economy. During the same time the Syndicate began to loose its
  control, and the Depression was a serious blow to their prestige
  on an international scale.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Social Engineers had made careful plans, and by
  manipulating the masses they controlled the elections. As their
  "figurehead" in politics, they choose the Social Democratic
  Party, in the beginning a small extreme leftist group that had
  grown under their control into a large, moderately leftist
  organisation with strong ties to the unions. They decided to
  bring it into power, and it became the largest party in the
  elections 1911. By carefully manipulating the other parties, the
  Engineers made sure it stayed in power and the political
  situation became stable. 1938 the organisations of the unions and
  the employers signed the Saltsjöbaden-treaty, signifying
  that the Social Engineers now controlled the economy together
  with the Syndicate.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Second World War was a great boost for the NWO in the
  whole world, and in Sweden it gave the Social Engineers the
  chance to start their greatest project. During the War Sweden
  remained neutral, and the political climate of nationalism,
  cooperation and planning for the needs of the people suited them
  perfectly. Their goal was to completely restructure Sweden into a
  perfect state, where the government and its associated
  organisations protected, helped and controlled the citizens
  completely. "Folkhemmet", "The Home of the People" became their
  slogan, and they started to enthusiastically work on their
  project, forcing all of the other conventions to help. They
  created a vast web of administration, overseeing, helping and
  planning for every possible aspect of society. Central computers
  would control and monitor the population, using their personal
  numbers for easy retrieval. Unemployment, poverty and
  maladjustment became problems to be solved like any other
  optimisation problem. Technological, social and economical
  progress became the main goals during the 50s and remained so
  until the beginning of the 80's.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The End of the Dream?
  </h2>
  The work of the Social Engineers
  began to first show signs of instability in the 70's, when
  radical groups outside of their control began to grow at an
  alarming rate. They quickly absorbed the environmentalists,
  feminists and radicals into their framework, simply turning them
  into parts of their network of organisations or political
  parties, but the Engineers began to worry about possible flaws in
  their structure. At the same time some of the Traditions began to
  expand their influence again, especially the Verbena, Cult of
  Ecstasy and Orphans. During a long time the Syndicate had helped
  create the dream of the Social Engineers, but now it began to
  chafe under their administration and their more and more
  repressive means.
  <p>
   In Mars 1985 the prime minister, Olof Palme, was assassinated
  on Sveavägen, the main ley-line of Stockholm. The killer was
  never caught, nor were there any obvious motive. The massive
  shock this caused made the safe reality the Social Engineers had
  carefully built over the years start to crumble at an alarming
  rate. Suddenly people started to notice problems, inefficiencies
  and lies around them. The Syndicate sprang into action and used
  the temporary confusion of the New World Order to regain much
  power, suddenly becoming equally strong as the Social Engineers.
  Who was behind the murder is still unknown, it might have been
  the Syndicate, the Traditions or just some sleepers.
  </p>
  <p>
   For the moment the ongoing struggle between the crumbling
  Social Engineers and the ruthless Syndicate is undecided. The
  economic crisis is used by both groups, as the Syndicate promises
  prosperity and economic growth, while the Engineers promise
  security and protection. At the same time some of the more
  conservative groups in the New World Order are gaining power from
  the chaos. People feel insecure and threatened, and demand
  protection from violence and crime. The rise of racism and
  violence has helped them to increase the number of police, to
  monitor suspicious people and to place surveillance in public
  places. At the same time the Syndicate is escaping from the
  control of the Social Engineers, using the industry as their tool
  of pressurising the government.
  </p>
  <hr>
   Some notes: I use the names of the Traditions rather loosely,
  since many of them has changed substantially. The "New World
  Order" of the 1600's had vastly different views, methods and
  goals than the NWO today, although they are clearly linked by
  their history and their ideology of creating strong states
  controlling their citizens.
   <p>
    Much of the secret planning behind the curtains described here
  are of course guesswork and theory. There are very little
  evidence left of Awakened activity, but those knowledgeable
  enough can probably see the traces for themselves.
