   <h2>
    The Paradigm
   </h2>
   <b>
    The Wheel
   </b>
   . The Great Wheel of
  Existence constantly turns, moved by Entropy. Everything that is
  will someday be no more. As one part rises, another part must
  sink. There can be no life without death. There can be no light
  without darkness. There can be no success without failure. Our
  duty is to make sure the Great Wheel turns smoothly, so that
  fresh possibilities are created as old are removed.
   <h2>
    Magick
   </h2>
   <b>
    Turning the Wheel
   </b>
   . We can turn the Wheel,
  making it move faster or slower, or even briefly stop it (but
  this entails a heavy price). Everything that exists is linked to
  change, and all change is ruled by the Wheel. By learning how
  different things change towards death and decay, we can learn how
  they interact with the Wheel, and thus control them.
   <h2>
    Spheres
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <b>
      Correspondence: Crossroads
     </b>
     . The Crossroads exist
    everywhere, providing everybody with infinite choices. Just as
    time is a cycle, space is also cyclic. Move far enough and you
    will return to your origin. By turning the Wheel of space, you
    can be anywhere.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Entropy: Change
     </b>
     . Entropy and Change are one. All
    that happens is driven by the forces of chance and decay. The
    Wheel can move faster or slower, or nudge changes into new
    cycles.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Forces: Dissipation
     </b>
     . Of all forms, the forces are
    the forms which change the most. They cause changes, and they
    dissipate quickly. By modulating how fast they dissipate and
    where, they can be controlled.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Life: Death
     </b>
     . All living beings survive on the death
    of others, feeding on their possibilities or extracting them
    from the world around them. In turn they will also die and
    sustain other life.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Matter: Dust
     </b>
     . Everything will sooner or later turn
    into dust. It is the most stable form of existence, and
    everything will sooner or later turn into it. By turning the
    Wheel, everything can be reduced to dust, or dust returned to
    its former glory.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Mind: Illusions
     </b>
     . Every being surrounds itself with
    comfortable illusions. Without illusions the unawakened cannot
    live. Break down some of their illusions and they will die, go
    mad or awaken. It is also possible to weave new illusions or
    change the old illusions.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Prime: Possibility
     </b>
     . Possibility is the building
    block of everything. Pure Possibility decays into reality.
    Reality decays into Possibility again when its time has passed.
    The dance between Possibility and Entropy creates the
    universe.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Spirit: The Other World
     </b>
     . The Wheel encompasses all
    of reality, all possibilities, not just the one we inhabit.
    Outside our world exist countless other worlds and inhabited by
    their own denizens. Below our world, below the Wheel, the
    worlds of the dead exist, where the old possibilities turn into
    dust to one day reform into life again.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Time: The Cycle
     </b>
     . As the Wheel turns, things come to
    pass. Old dies and is replaced by new. New grows old.
    Everything moves along its destined course governed by the
    turning of the Wheel. If the Wheel is turned faster, things
    will change faster. Stop the wheel, and activity will
    cease.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h2>
    Arete
   </h2>
   <b>
    Disillusion
   </b>
   . Every being is veiled in
  illusions, but some have broken down some of the lesser ones.
  They see more of the true world, and thus gain the power to
  understand the Wheel. Many proudly proclaim their enlightenment
  and refuse to search further, afraid of breaking their new
  illusions. The greatest illusion of all is that one have freed
  oneself from all illusions. This is also an illusion.
   <h2>
    Quintessence
   </h2>
   <b>
    Possibilities
   </b>
   . When Possibilities
  first appear, they are without form and meaning. Soon they will
  become real under the influence of Entropy, but a wise mage
  collects some possibilities to use in the Turning.
   <h2>
    Paradox
   </h2>
   <b>
    Blockage
   </b>
   . Sometimes mages attempting to
  turn the Wheel too violently fail, and cause it to become stuck
  or disturb its smooth turning. The Wheel will press against the
  blockage, and sooner or later it will give away, causing damage
  but restoring the balance.
   <h2>
    Awakening
   </h2>
   <b>
    Death
   </b>
   . Every being is awakened once in
  its lifetime - At the moment of dying. It will see beyond the
  illusions of its existence and pass into a new existence.
  Unfortunately almost all choose to forget that moment. It is our
  task to awaken those who are ready, and make others ready.
   <h2>
    Mage-specific Backgrounds
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <b>
      Arcane: The Shroud of the Reaper
     </b>
     . When somebody
    frees himself from the illusions of life, and yet returns to do
    his duty, many of the sleepers will fear him. They
    subconsciously fear the presence of Death, and will avoid
    anybody or anything connected to It, so much they will even
    suppress the memory of ever having been close to It.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Avatar: Kia
     </b>
     . As the people are reincarnated, they
    purify their Kias and give them the chance to learn. A mage
    whose Kia has undergone many Good Deaths will have a most
    powerful inner core.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Destiny: Karma
     </b>
     . The Wheel might slow down or even
    stop for a time, but it will continue its unending cycles. In
    the same way the Karma of past incarnations will influence the
    present; maybe not today, but surely someday.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Dream: Intuition
     </b>
     . There is only one true source of
    wisdom, and that is your intuition. It is the whispered wisdom
    of your past incarnations, the amassed learning of your
    Kia.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Node: Garden
     </b>
     . New possibilities enter the world
    constantly. In some places they grow stronger than others,
    forming gardens of possibilities and newness. A wise mage
    gathers the growth, and prunes the weeds of these gardens.
