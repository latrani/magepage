  <h1>
   434 ZHJ
  </h1>
  <i>

  <p>
   Marauders are by definition unpredictable, but often their
  servants are even more dangerous. And sometimes they even turn
  their victims into servants; 434 ZHJ is a horrific example.
  </p>
  <p>
   What most mages first notice is the smoke; it smells of blood.
  Then the roaring noise. Then
   <i>
    it
   </i>
   suddenly appears out of
  the shadows, shredding, devouring and destroying. Shocked
  survivors tell confusing stories about a man-car descending upon
  them, impaling flesh upon rusty pipes and shafts and drinking the
  gushing blood through what could be a mouth, or could be a motor
  hood with teeth.
  </p>
  <p>
   The story behind this umbral terror is known to only the
  Marauders and 434 ZHJ itself. Several years ago a cabal of Bai
  Dai descended upon a small British village, rending reality with
  Paradox and dragging the buildings screaming into the Deep Umbra.
  Among the victims was also another kind of being than the wailing
  and easily shattered sleepers, a vampire. When the Bai Dai found
  the frenzied man-beast they immediately took a liking to him and
  decided to reward him for his hunger. They took a car that had
  followed the buildings into the Abyss and merged the screaming
  undead with it, filling its tanks with blood and paradox. Then
  they left it, too involved with ruthlessly exterminating the
  number three from reality to care about what they had done.
  </p>
  <p>
   Seven months and seven days later 434 ZHJ broke through the
  Gauntlet in a night-club in Soho, killing 5 people before being
  driven back by a paradox backlash. A few hours later a baglady
  witnessed how something awful crashed through one wall in a back
  alley, collapsed into a bloody pile on the ground, and then
  jumped into the sky roaring like a lion. Since then 434 ZHJ has
  appeared in the most unlikely places, breaking the Gauntlet to
  attack people and then withdrawing as paradox caught up with
  it.

   <b>
    Appearance
   </b>
   : A huge hybrid between car, man and beast.
  434 ZHJ is over three meters tall when it stands up, and masses
  at least a ton. Its consists of a warped mixture of undead flesh,
  rusty car parts and dirt, dripping blood, oil and smoke. Its arms
  and legs end in broken wheels and metal claws. Its body is
  partially human, partially a car, ending in a huge head dominated
  by a gaping mouth/hood filled with metal teeth and a roaring
  engine that massacres any flesh it bites on. Instead of eyes it
  has two powerful red lights.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sometimes 434 ZHJ walks like a man, sometimes it bounds like a
  tiger and sometimes it moves like a car. No man can outrun it in
  an open area, and in enclosed spaces it can easily reach out with
  its claws and pipes. It is hideously strong, and its metal-flesh
  is highly resistant to damage. Even worse, it can heal itself
  using the blood and flesh it devours.
  </p>
  <pre>
   Str (machine): 7 Cha: - Per: 2
Dex: 3  Man: -  Int: 1
Sta (metal): 5  App: -  Wit: 4

Alertness: 3
Brawl: 4
Intimidation (bestial) 6
Drive (self): 4
Repair: 2

Willpower: 5
Arete: 5
  </pre>
  The metal flesh corresponds to three automatic successes on
the soak roll. To affect it, Matter combined with Life is needed.
  <p>
   434 ZHJ has rusty iron claws, doing Str + 3 damage, a fanged
  hood (Str + 2 damage, each health level damage gives it a blood
  point) and various loose shafts, pipes, sharp edges and doors
  (Str damage, difficulty 5 to hit. The pipes can drain blood).

  <h2>
   Powers
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Umbral Breach
  </h3>
  434 ZHJ can crash through the Gauntlet,
  opening a temporary portal. This damages it somewhat, giving it
  half the gauntlet thickness health levels damage.
  <h3>
   Blind
  </h3>
  By shining its lights straight into the eyes of a
  victim, it can temporarily blind the victim. This increases all
  difficulties with 5. The victim has to succeed with wits +
  alertness with difficulty 7 to look away in time, each success
  decreases the difficulty by one.
  <h3>
   Regrow
  </h3>
  Each bloodpoint (roughly equal to one damage
  level) it ingests, it can heal itself one level. It can also add
  bloodpoints temporarily to its physical attributes, raising them
  for the duration of the scene.
