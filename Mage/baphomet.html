   Baphomet, also known as the Sabbath Goat, The Great God Pan,
  Abraxas, Thanateros or the Horned God, is not, strictly speaking,
  a real being. It is a personification of the Life Force of every
  being, the sum of all Life on Earth. It is a force which can be
  summoned by mages, but it cannot be easily controlled. Some
  groups of Verbena invoke this being, to strengthen the link
  between them and Life.
   <p>
    Baphomet is Pangenitor and Panphage, All-begetter and
  All-devourer. It is both man, animal and plant. It is ever
  changing, ever growing and dying. It is mindless, only filled
  with a dionysian will to grow, feed, mate, survive and die, again
  and again. It is filled with the ecstatic joy of life and death,
  and it exists inside every living being. The purpose of the
  invocations the Verbena do is to awaken this force and set it
  free.
   </p>
   <p>
    Baphomet is often depicted as a goat, or a man with horns and
  goat-legs. Since it is a mix between all life on Earth, it can
  look like everything. It can be seen as a hermaphroditic mix
  between human, reptile, insect, plant, mammal, bacteria and all
  other life. Parts of it are rotting or dead, since it also
  encompasses the death and decay that is necessary for the
  survival of life. It is often crowned by great horns signifying
  its power, and often changes shape as parts grow, change into new
  permutations, start to rot away and reform. It is filled with
  intense vitality, and will stimulate it in others.
   </p>
   <p>
    A symbol often associated with Baphomet is the inverted
  pentagram. In its upright form, the pentagram symbolizes the
  control over nature Man wields with his intellect and power. It
  can be thought of as an upright man, with imperiously
  outstretched arms and legs, ruling the elements with his head.
  This is the form the Order of Hermes uses. The inverted pentagram
  symbolizes the power nature wields over Man and his intellect. It
  can be thought of as the head of a goat. The elements rule the
  head of Man.
   </p>
   <p>
    The worship of Baphomet has survived since time immemorial.
  The cult of Mendes in Egypt worshipped it. The bacchants of
  ancient Greece worshipped it. According to the myth, Queen
  Parsifae gave birth to the Minotaur after falling in love with a
  bull, which could have been a manifestation of Baphomet. The
  worship survived in some mystery cults during the classic era,
  and well into the middle ages. Some of the myths about the
  witches Sabbaths may well be distorted legends about the cult of
  Baphomet. The Knights Templar were accused of worshipping it (of
  course, it is hard not to name any perversion or heresy the
  Templars have not been accused for). Today some Verbena and a few
  members of the Cult of Ecstasy are actively worshipping it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Why do the Verbena covens invoke Baphomet? One reason is to
  strengthen their link to Life. By invoking and worshipping
  Baphomet, they may gain insight into the secrets of Life, and
  feel its power. Baphomet is the sum of all life, and knows all
  its secrets and desires. While it may be mindless, it is
  sometimes possible to divine what the Lifeforce wants from its
  actions. By invoking Baphomet, a mage may learn secrets few other
  beings possess about the living world (perhaps he or she will
  gain study points in Life). Baphomet can also be invoked for the
  sheer pleasure of it, to return to that blessed state before
  civilization and technology and their dubious benefits. It will
  make people recognize their primitive parts, and accept them, at
  least during the rite.
   </p>
   <p>
    Most mages outside of Verbena find the summoning of Baphomet
  distasteful, especially the Order of Hermes and Virtual Adepts,
  who want the human mind to rule nature, not the other way around.
  Many mages think Baphomet smacks of Marauders, and point to the
  deeds of the bacchants. The Technocracy, to the extent they know
  about the worship of Baphomet, are extremely opposed to it, even
  more than against normal magick. Baphomet embodies all what the
  Technocracy hates and it is a deadly risk to their static
  reality. Unlike most other manifestations, Baphomet is somewhat
  resistant to Static reality, and can even awaken sleepers. As
  soon as the Technocracy learns about an attempted summoning, they
  set all their forces against it.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Invocation of Baphomet (Life 1 Spirit 2)
    </b>
    This rite is
  most often done by an entire coven of Verbena. The high priest or
  priestess performs the actual magick, while the other
  participants chant and concentrate their power. The mage chants
  and visualizes himself as Baphomet, while other participants
  anoint him with blood and draws the seal of Baphomet on the
  forehead of the mage. As the rite progresses, the mage becomes
  possessed by Baphomet and his own mind becomes submerged in the
  raw life of It.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Invoke Baphomet Physically (Life 3 Spirit 2)
    </b>
    This rote
  is almost similar to the above rote, but the mage lets Baphomet
  take full control over his whole organism. Baphomet will be able
  to take on whatever form it wants, but unlike the effect "Avatar"
  described below, the mage will return to his or her normal form
  after the ritual has ended.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Manifest Baphomet (Life 5 Spirit 2 Prime 2)
    </b>
    Sometimes
  the coven does not want to invoke Baphomet, but try to evoke it
  instead. The coven chants and sings, and their concentrate their
  power and lifeforce at the blood in the cauldron. When Baphomet
  appears, it will rise from the blood in its true shape.
   </p>
   <p>
    When Baphomet has arrived, the ritual often turns into a
  bacchanalian orgy, where planning and order are scattered by the
  primal urges. It has happened that Baphomet and his followers,
  both human and animal, have rampaged across the country spreading
  death, chaos and fertility in their wake. Compare this to the
  Greek myths about the meneads. However, sometimes Baphomet seems
  to be content to stay where it is, and simply accept worship. And
  in some cases it will turn into a fearsome force nothing can
  resist, and engulf the participants and anybody in the vicinity.
  Invoking Baphomet can be dangerous.
   </p>
   <p>
    Each success in the ritual will make the invoked aspect of
  Baphomet stronger. Below are sample effects the manifest being
  can do. The invoked aspect of Baphomet can use all powers below
  the level it has been invoked to. It will not necessarily use all
  its available powers, but it often uses many of them.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Presence of Baphomet
    </b>
    Baphomet possesses the invoker,
  and will act through him. Generally, Baphomet will not be very
  intelligible. The invoker will live out the urges of Baphomet,
  which can be dangerous for the mage; often some acolytes are
  around to try to restrain Baphomet if it gets out of hand. All
  living beings will recognize the presence of Baphomet, even if
  they do not understand what it is. The invoker will appear as
  something far more than just another human being, and many will
  feel an instinctive urge to worship.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Blessing of Baphomet (Life 2)
    </b>
    All kinds of life in the
  vicinity of Baphomet start to grow and multiply faster. Flowers
  bloom, crops become bountiful, all female beings become fertile.
  A place where Baphomet has appeared often sometimes looks like a
  jungle, filled with wines and insects.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Primal Urges (Mind 2)
    </b>
    In the presence of Baphomet the
  inhibitions of civilization melt away, and all the repressed
  urges and desires of life become primary. All humans and domestic
  animals in the vicinity throw off the veneer of behavior they
  normally wear, and start to act like the animals they are.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Pure Emotion (Mind 2)
    </b>
    Baphomet can project the primal
  emotions of fear, pleasure, rage, hunger, thirst or lust. The
  emotions are much more pure and powerful than "civilized"
  emotions and will take precedence over them.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     The Noble Savage (Mind 3)
    </b>
    Baphomet awakens the primal
  memories, and makes everybody return to the state of innocence
  before thought and logic. Every human knows, deep down, that this
  is how life really should be. This effect has an interesting side
  effect: paradox is minimized. The affected sleepers have become
  primitive savages, and will not care whether something is
  possible or not. [Every affected sleeper will count as awakened
  in regard to paradox, at least Life magick.]
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Avatar (Life 3)
    </b>
    Baphomet starts to reshape the body of
  the invoker into its own image. Generally, the change is
  humanoid. Antlers sprout, the face becomes animal with great
  teeth, claws emerge or fur grows. The changes are quite distinct,
  but do not really change the body completely. The Avatar has a
  great aura of primal force around itself, and will make most
  beings feel a stirring urge to worship it.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Instant Growth (Life 3 Prime 2)
    </b>
    Baphomet can make
  plants (and sometimes animals) grow at impossible rates; from
  seed to fully grown tree in a few seconds. Around it flowers
  bloom in winter, wines entrap people and fill their mouths with
  grapes, trees grow up and impale people and children grow up in
  seconds.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Meld (Life 4)
    </b>
    Baphomet exists in all living beings, and
  can be awakened. When anybody touches Baphomet, his flesh will
  meld with the changeable flesh of it and stick. It is impossible
  to get loose unless the limb is cut of or Baphomet releases the
  victim. Embracing Baphomet is not recommended. Sometimes Baphomet
  chooses to absorb the victim completely.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Change Others (Life 4)
    </b>
    Baphomet sometimes changes
  people in its vicinity, for apparently no reason at all. It may
  be punishment, or as a reward, or just randomly. It may give them
  horns, tails, donkey ears or other animal features. Sometimes
  Baphomet changes blood into intoxicating wine, or vice versa.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Strike Madness (Mind 4)
    </b>
    Baphomet can turn anyone, human
  or animal, into a raving madman or beast. The victim will be
  totally controlled by the urges of Baphomet, and the effect can
  last long after Baphomet has left.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Children of Baphomet (Life 4)
    </b>
    It is not uncommon for
  Baphomet to sire children with humans, animals and plants. The
  children of weaker manifestations will not survive, or will be
  stillborn, but at this level they may survive. These children
  will look like a mix between human and animal. Some have animal
  heads and human bodies (like the minotaur or the Egyptian gods),
  others look like satyrs, centaurs or other beings from the myth.
  Many are completely impossible to classify. A few look almost
  completely like humans or an animal with just a few strange
  features. All have some of the mentality of their father/mother,
  and will be filled with a wanton lust for life and survival.
  Their intelligence can range from almost normal to pure animal
  instincts, or even vary. Since these beings are actually
  genetically and biologically correct (after all, they
    <em>
     could
    </em>
    be strange mutations), they will not gain paradox
  as long as they stay out of sight.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Turn Into Animal (Life 5)
    </b>
    Baphomet can turn people into
  animals and animals into people. The human minds are not really
  changed, but due to their new body and brains, they will behave
  much more animalistic. And since Baphomet often has used the
  lower level mind-effects already, the difference between human
  and animal will already be blurred. Animal turned into humans
  will also have problems, since they gain intelligence but do not
  understand it.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     The Moving God (Mind 5)
    </b>
    Baphomet moves from one body to
  another, or exist in both bodies. In this way, it can avoid being
  banished by someone killing its body. It is not uncommon for it
  to use the body of its attacker(s). Sometimes it possesses a
  large group of people or animals, and behaves as a pack.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     True Form (Life 5)
    </b>
    Baphomet emerges in his true form,
  as an amalgamation of all life. The invokers body burst forth
  limbs, heads, trunks and organs in a ever changing mass. There is
  no logic or plan in the shape Baphomet takes, only fluid chaos.
  This form can't be hurt by normal damage, since all wounds simply
  melt away in the reforming flesh. Only aggravated damage will
  persist.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Baphomet
   </h2>
   Baphomet does not have any real traits, since it
  is a personified force. When possessing someone, physical
  attributes and charisma will rise a few points while intelligence
  and manipulation disappear. When appearing in its "true" form, it
  will have about 5 or more in all attributes except intelligence,
  appearance and manipulation. It cannot be influenced by Mind,
  since it is totally mindless, and it is quite resistent to all
  Life and Entropy magick.
   <h2>
    Story Ideas
   </h2>
   A group of Verbena and Garou are united by
  their Worship of Baphomet. This could be used to create a
  crossover chronicle.
   <p>
    A Verbena mage has invoked Baphomet several times, and has
  become too good at it. She will automatically succeed in invoking
  Baphomet if she concentrates, and she has started to accidentally
  awaken it when she uses Life magick. Sometimes she becomes
  possessed in her dreams. She has realized that she is slowly
  losing control to it, and soon she will start to manifest
  Baphomet whenever she uses magick or loses control.
   </p>
   <p>
    Baphomet is aware of a great threat to life somewhere, but
  since it is mindless, it can not explain it. Mages seeing it will
  understand that it is disturbed, but they must follow its actions
  to see what is going on. This could turn out to be very
  dangerous, since Baphomet is hardly the most safe guide there is.
  And what force is threatening life on such a scale that Baphomet
  has reacted?
   </p>
   <p>
    A Son of Ether or Progenitor has heard of Baphomet, and wants
  to obtain cell samples. The theory is that these cells can be
  bred in vitro and produce life-force or perhaps even
  mini-Baphomets.
   </p>
   <p>
    A coven of Verbena has become a band of rampaging bacchants,
  controlled by a manifestation of Baphomet. They storm isolated
  villages and generally spread mayhem and chaos. The Technocracy
  is extremely irate, and is about to start to use
    <em>
     really
    </em>
    heavy artillery to stop the band before they reach a larger city
  (where they could cause enormous harm to static reality and
  sleepers). This could lead to a moral dilemma for Tradition
  mages. While they detest marauders and want to protect sleepers,
  this is a chance to cause much harm to the Technocracy if they
  can help the bacchants reach civilization before they are
  stopped.
