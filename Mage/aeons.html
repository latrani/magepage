   In the beginning there was the One, the One who will be in the
  end.
   <p>
    The Earth and heavens were not, and day and night were not,
  but the One was and will be. Light and dark, the highest and the
  lowest, all was united in the One.
   </p>
   <p>
    But Ialdabaoth the blind Demiurge broke free, proclaiming the
  word "I am". And thus disunity was created.
   </p>
   <p>
    Ialdabaoth named things, and they were separated from the One.
  Thus he created the world.
   </p>
   <p>
    First Ialdabaoth proclaimed "Let there be Saturn, the first
  and greatest of the Aeons!". And the Lord of Time was created,
  and Ialdabaoth saw that past was separated from future.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then Ialdabaoth proclaimed "Let there be Jupiter, the Aeon of
  Separation!". And the Lord of Space was created, and Ialdabaoth
  saw that above was separated from below.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then Ialdabaoth proclaimed "Let there be Mars, the Aeon of
  Destruction!". And the Lord of Dust was created, and Ialdabaoth
  saw that decay and imperfection ruled everything.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then Ialdabaoth proclaimed "Let there be Mercury, the Aeon of
  Consciousness!". And the Lord of the Mind was created, and
  Ialdabaoth saw that all things were distinguished and named.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then Ialdabaoth proclaimed "Let there be the Moon, the Aeon of
  Spirit!". And the Queen of the Night was created, and Ialdabaoth
  saw that the worlds were separated by the abyss of night.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then Ialdabaoth proclaimed "Let there be Venus, the Aeon of
  Life!". And the Lady of Plants and Beasts was created, and
  Ialdabaoth saw that all life grew, survived and died in endless
  cycles.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then Ialdabaoth proclaimed "Let there be the Earth, the Aeon
  of Matter!". And Gaea, known as the Kingdom, was created. And
  Ialdabaoth saw that the fragments of the One was trapped within
  shells of matter and movement, ruled by the urges of Venus,
  imprisoned by the ring-pass-nots of the Moon, the names of
  Mercury, the strife of Mars, the labyrinths of Jupiter and the
  eternities of Saturn. And he proclaimed: "Hereafter disunity will
  rule to the end of time!"
   </p>
   <p>
    But then he heard the voice of Sofia, the wisdom of the One
  imprisoned within the fragments: "Thou hast spoken the truth, O
  Lord of Dispersion. Disunity will rule to the end of time, but
  time itself will once die. One day the aeons themselves will die,
  and then unity will be restored". And then the One created the
  King of the Aeons, the Lord of the Sun, to guide the fragments
  towards unity.
   </p>
   <p>
    One day the Daughter will marry and unite with the shining
  King, and this will begin the great Reconciliation. The One will
  gather together and the universe will be reunited.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the beginning there was the One, the One who will be in the
  end.
