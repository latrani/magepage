   Modules

   He shuddered with pleasure as the knives neatly dissected his
  flesh. Identical copies appeared on all sides of him, joining his
  arms and legs seamlessly into an infinite network of bliss in the
  black emptiness of space. The network gradually began to curve,
  becoming an immense sphere of outstretched humans where
  involuntary vibrations propagated in complex patterns, like
  seismic waves projected onto a globe. Slowly the sphere began to
  move inwards due to its self-gravity, accelerating and fuelling
  even greater pleasure until it imploded into a brilliant orgasm
  of light and ripped flesh.

   Gordon unlinked the VR module and faced the grid of his
  working environment. Bizarre stuff, but strangely compelling. And
  there was more of it now, while he was testing the first module
  another one had appeared in the data-cluster with the others. A
  file he was certain he had not downloaded. Cautiously he scanned
  the data, but it was inert. No hidden viruses, no systems that
  could externalise, just plain VR simulation. Overcome with
  curiosity he activated it.

   He had no body at all. He were nowhere. He was empty space. He
  saw everything in him from all directions at once. It was
  confusing at first, but gradually he began to feel relaxed,
  purified.
  </p>
  <p>
   Suddenly something appeared from the outside, from another
  direction than the ones he contained. Its existence touched him
  as a sharp and sensual point, and as it began to move through his
  three-dimensional body it left a gash of warped space-time that
  made him shudder of pleasure. A four dimensional scalpel? Or a
  pen?
  </p>
  <p>
   Gracefully, silently the object moved through space, drawing
  what could only be three- dimensional calligraphy directly on his
  soul. He wanted to scream, to beg for more or for release, but he
  had no body and no mouth. For a subjective eternity he felt how
  the pattern grew and the strains on space/himself increased until
  they were unbearable. With a sudden, perfect stroke the object
  finished the last curve and withdrew from the finished
  design.
  </p>
  <p>
   He was pain. He was pleasure. And he knew he would remain so
  for all eternity.
