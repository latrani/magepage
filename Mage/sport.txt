Description

     These three darts look like normal darts, but whenever they are thrown
     they will unerringly fly straight towards the bullseye. The mage
     automatically hits bulleyes when playing a game of darts, and gets a -2
     to any other rolls to hit with the darts. The darts fo 1 die of
     non-aggravated damage. Using the dart for anything but playing a game
     of darts uses one point of quintessence.

     The glove, when worn, increases the mage's game of bowling. It has been
     known to cause several Awakened bowlers to win championships. When
     bowling while wearing the glove the ball tends to do things that are
     beneficial to the bowler. Each game played with the glove uses one
     point of quintessence. When wearing the glove and attemping to throw
     anything the user will get 4 extra dice; each use in this way uses a
     point of quintessence.

Description

     This was the crowning achievement of the mage, for he was a horrible
     golfer. Whenever you spend a Quintessence point with these your next
     swing at the ball will go into the hole, no matter how far away it is.
