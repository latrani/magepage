   Virtual Adept Paradigm

   <h2>
    The Paradigm
   </h2>
   <b>
    The Program
   </b>
   : the rules of the game
  are written, debugged and maintained by the Sleepers via some as
  yet not understood semi-autonomous process. The Technocracy is
  making low-level Program changes so their hacks don't cause
  system crashes.
   <h2>
    Magick
   </h2>
   <b>
    Hacking
   </b>
   -- if everything is coded
  somewhere, then temporary changes can be hacked into the Program
  (i.e. the Paradigm). Permanent changes to the Program must be
  Reprogrammed.
   <h2>
    Spheres
   </h2>
   All aspects of the Program are handled by
  imbedded Modules.
   <ul>
    <li>
     <b>
      Correspondence: Positioning
     </b>
     -- all Objects have a
    Position within the graphic user interface (the GUI) of the
    Program. Thus, it possible to hack the program to do a "grid
    search" or to change your position.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Mind: Software
     </b>
     -- when dealing with the processing
    of Information. Hardware -- when enhancing the performance of
    the VA's mind (upgrading) or altering the performance of
    others'. I/O -- when affecting or enhancing the senses.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Prime: Programming/Reprogramming
     </b>
     -- temporary
    changes are easy to hack, but machine-level programming makes
    the changes permanent.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Time: Cycle Speed/Clock
     </b>
     -- the Program's Cycle Speed
    can be altered if you know the right hacks to affect that
    module. The area of effect may be limited to individual Icons
    as well.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Entropy: Chaos
     </b>
     -- everything is organized according
    to orders of Chaos. Even elegantly clean programs and hacks
    have an element of Chaos; where there is absolute order, the
    Program seems to introduce Chaos on its own. It is believed
    this is part of the Program's self-diagnosis algorith (see
    Paradox).
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Spirit: Intelligence
     </b>
     -- this is the Module covering
    artificial intelligence, self-perpetuating viruses, search
    daemons and anything else that has a self-animating force.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Pattern Magick: Icons
     </b>
     -- Objects, Wetware and
      Electricity are all objects, and each are handled by a
      different Module.
     <ul>
      <li>
       <b>
        Forces: Electricity
       </b>
       -- this is ultimately at the
        core of all forces as perceived by VAs. Lasers are powered
        by electricity. Machines use electricity. Een Wetware seems
        to use electricity. Any force that can't be perceived as
        electrical cannot be perceived by a VA.
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        Matter: Objects
       </b>
       -- everything solid is an Object
        in the Program. Objects are programmed to interact with
        other Icons in a consistent manner.
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        Life: Wetware, Biotech
       </b>
       -- messy stuff, but it
        provides the icons through which Intelligence works with
        the Software.
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h2>
    Arete
   </h2>
   <b>
    Eliteness
   </b>
   -- how well the Program is
  understood, and how well the VA can alter the Program. How you
  separate the posers from the real netheads.
   <h2>
    Quintessence
   </h2>
   <b>
    Output
   </b>
   -- the final result of a hack
  or a reprogramming. Output is a somewhat mystical concept, and
  many VAs believe they can improve their output through smart
  drugs, intense study or experiences.
   <h2>
    Paradox
   </h2>
   <b>
    Errors
   </b>
   -- VAs accumulate "errors" in their
  icons if they make deep changes in the Program, or if they screw
  up a quick hack. Too many errors cause areas of the Program to
  crash. However, the Program has many levels of self-diagnosis,
  and will attempt to put the interface back online without
  disrupting other users. VAs that cause too many system crashes
  are eventually Debugged (e.g. paradox backlash).
   <h2>
    Mage-specific Backgrounds
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <b>
      Arcane -- Transparency
     </b>
     . Some Icons are more
    transparent to other users than others.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Avatar -- Productivity
     </b>
     . Each VA is destined to a
    certain amount of output in their lives. Some will output a lot
    more than others.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Destiny -- Focus
     </b>
     . VA's with intense focus can work
    miracles and never stray from their path. Those with too much
    focus are usually a drag to be around because they're so
    intense.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Dream -- Data Retrieval
     </b>
     . If all human knowledge is
    available somewhere in the Web, then it can be retrieved. Some
    talented VAs have actually learned how to unconsciously tap
    into the Web's resources and extract this data. This process is
    not well understood, and cannot be artifically created without
    serious Intelligence programming.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Node -- Inspiration
     </b>
     . With inspiration, output can be
    increased and larger hacks to the Program can be achieved. This
    inspiration is drawn from a location within which the VA
    experiences enhanced levels of output.
