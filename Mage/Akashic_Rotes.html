    Akashic magic leans heavily on the principles of the 4 sects,
  particularly on the ideas of avoidance and redirection. Combat
  rotes increase the Brotherhood's already formidible martial
  prowess, but they are rarely fatal in their main intent, since
  the Brotherhood always carries the hope that defeat in battle
  will be an enlightening experience. While many of these effects
  may seem vulgar, if they are employed with a Do maneuver, most
  witnesses will accept them as coincidental, thanks to the stories
  that have circulated about the powers of martial arts. The
  Brotherhood discourages the more outrageous stunts of the
  chop-socky films both because they generate paradox and because
  they encourage reliance on magic instead of physical ability.
  Instead, they favor rotes that enhance one's natural abilities,
  and a few of the more rigorous Akashic masters reject the use of
  combat magic as weaking the discipline necessary for Do.

        This rote has a long history among the Orange Robes, for whom it
  forms a basic element of their philosophy. It redirects the
  energy of an attack, often returning it upon the attacker, who
  can be made to strike herself.

          (With Forces 2, the force of the blow is diverted, while
  with Forces 3, it is returned against the attacker. Each success
  will counter 2 levels of damage. If the higher level of the rote
  is used and the damage is completely cancelled, the damage will
  be done to the attacker.)

           By utilizing the principle of yielding force, the doist can turn
  a target's force against him when grappling, thus increasing her

           The Blue Skins of Tibet long ago perfected the technique of lung

  larger than shallow rivers cannot be crossed with this
  effect.)

           This rote was first used by the Akashic monk Parandasambahava

            Employing the principle that a straight line attack is best met
  with a circular defense, and applying that principle to the
  'direction' of emotions, the Dragon Scale Minxing Yuan learned to
  avoid conflicts by redirecting the emotions that cause them onto
  other targets.

          (This rote shifts the target of an emotion from one thing
  to another. For example, if a Progenitor has decided to attack
  Min for putting an end to his experiments on people, she could
  shift his anger from herself to his lab partner, causing him to
  attack his comrade instead of her. Strong, unfocused emotions
  require fewer successes, perhaps 2 to 3, to redirect while subtle
  feelings or emotions strongly focused on a particular target
  require 4, 5 or more.)

           <br>
            Minxing Yuan realized that the principle of devastating one's
  opponent if one could not avoid combat was facilitated if she had
  some idea of how dangerous a potential opponent was before she
  fought him. With this in mind, Min learned how to estimate a
  person's fighting ability by watching how they moved and how
  their thoughts flowed, and thus was able to avoid many fights
  that she could not have won.

  in Str, Dex, Stam, Do, Brawl, and Melee. A single success tells
  her if the target has those attributes and abilities. Two
  successes give the general level [low, medium, high]. Three gives
  them in terms of the doist's own ratings(lower, higher, the
  same), while four or more gives the exact level.)

           This common rote has existed for millenia, although its origins

            The young Dragon Scale Little Thunder spent a great deal of time
  watching martial arts movies about ninjas. Although his mentor
  chided him for such a frivolous pursuit, Little Thunder was
  inspired to develop rotes that reproduced some of the abilities
  of the cinematic ninjas. The most useful such rote involves
  identifying the weak spots in a security system and them using
  them. Guards are encouraged to overlook the intruder's
  presence.

           The Orange Robes built this rote off of the principle of the
  preceding one, and developed a useful form of mental defense.
  By

  mentally off balance and gains the upper hand in the psychic
  battle.

           The Akashic Brotherhood normally uses koans, or riddles, to guide
  Sleepers to Awakening and the Awakened to Ascension. These koans
  traditionally take the form of a peculiar question or statement
  that the subject ponders and learns spiritual truths from. The
  most famous, of course, is "What is the sound of one hand
  clapping?" but there are many others. The Blue Skin scholar Li
  Chao Wu, however, discovered a different use for the koan when he
  was being stalked by a Euthanatos assassin. Since Li had vowed
  never to stain himself with combat, he chose a different method
  to defend himself, and when the assassin approached him, he
  uttered a koan so powerful that the assassin was forced to ponder
  it for several minutes, allowing Li to make his escape.

  he attempts to work out the puzzle involved. Note that this rote
  is most effective against those who are conditioned to such
  puzzles, and is virtually useless against thugs with no
  Meditation skill. The effects dissapate if the target is
  attacked.)

           The pious Dragon Scale River Willow once needed to search an
  office of the New World Order but wished to make certain that she

            This rote employs the Dragon Scale principle of defeating your
  enemies as quickly as possible, in this case by disabling the
  target's limbs.

          (Entropy determines the target's weak points, such as
  joints, nerve clusters, and so on, and allows the doist to strike
  to disable. It does one level of damage per success. 1 success
  will temporarily disable a digit or sensory organ, 2 to 3
  successes will render an arm, leg, or internal organ useless, and
  4 to 5 successes will paralyze the target or leave them
  dazed.)
