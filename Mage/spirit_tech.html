   It moved through the changing patterns. Most of them were
  uninteresting, and it ignored them and passed on. But suddenly it
  noted a glint of structure, which it immediately arrived at. It
  was a small pattern, a very simple mechanism. The mechanism was
  elegant, simple yet delicately balanced. But there was a flaw,
  which made it work improperly. Quickly, the observer traced its
  links backwards and found a mind. Like all human minds, it was a
  mess of half-formed patterns, lightning fast structures and the
  low rumble of organic machinery. But there, inside it, was the
  structure of the mechanism. The observer touched it, changing it
  slightly. Then it quickly moved on.

    Polhem suddenly awoke. He looked across the table to the
  model, suddenly realizing why the gears got in each others way,
  and how simple it was to fix it. "Why didn't I think of it
  before?" he asked himself as he began to work.

    The Spirit of Technology is an umbrood with quite alien
  motivations. Its only interest is beautiful structures, whether
  mathematical, technical or mental. It spends most of its time
  searching for interesting structures, and when it finds them it
  studies them, admires them or tries to perfect them if it finds
  some imperfections. In a way it can be thought of as a kind of
  muse of technology, inspiring inventors and scientists with new
  ideas.
   </p>
   <p>
    The spirit is interested in elegant designs, and does not care
  about their uses at all. A elegantly designed pencil sharpener is
  as important as an elegant missile-defense system. From the
  perspective of the spirit, it is like comparing a minimalistic
  piece of Japanese calligraphy with the fresco of the Sistine
  chapel. To be of interest to the spirit, the structure must be
  both functional and ingeniously realized. It dislikes any
  structure which uses unnecessary material, does too many things
  at the same time (unless it does this in a very elegant way) and
  most important, it must avoid disorder (unless the disorder is
  harnessed, in which case the spirit will be very impressed). In a
  way, the spirit is a kind of "technology hacker".
   </p>
   <p>
    The Spirit cannot stand a
    <em>
     nearly
    </em>
    perfect structure,
  and will do its best to perfect it. Mostly, it does this by
  "coincidentally" inspiring the inventor or somebody else to do
  the necessary changes, but sometimes it fixes glaring errors
  itself. At times it influences people to create some of its own
  designs. These are beautiful inventions, with a hint of
  alienness. There is absolutely no way to perfect them, as every
  angle and distance is optimal. Every part interlocks with other
  parts like a 3D puzzle, creating a whole out of smaller
  parts.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sometimes it "adopts" an inventor, mage or other promising
  human, and begins to inspire him or her to create new, beautiful
  technology. The spirit is a great teacher, and the student will
  quickly begin to create radically new and elegant designs.
  Unfortunately the spirit also expects more and more of its
  student, which becomes stuck between the ever more demanding
  spirit and the sloppy, prosaic reality, which does not understand
  their visions. Many of the students of the spirit has collapsed
  when the strain became to great, and the spirit decided they were
  unworthy and moved on. A typical case was Srinavasa Ramanujan,
  the Indian mathematician.

    The Spirit seldom manifests physically, and when it does, it
  will manifests as a pattern of order: a mathematical theorem
  neatly written on a blackboard, a computer program or a abstract
  fractal on a TV screen. Most of the time, it speaks to people's
  subconscious. When met in the Umbra, it looks like a complex web
  of information, a bit like a cross between a map, a electronic
  diagram and a geometrical theorem.

    It is not allied with the Technomancers, but may sometimes
  help them (especially Iteration X and Virtual Adepts) if they are
  building something it likes. On the other hand, many of their
  designs are ugly from the spirit's point of view, and it tries to
  change them. The Technomancers who know about it regard it as a
  nuisance, but not a large threat to reality (yet). In the
  traditions, it sometimes helps Sons of Ether and Hermetic mages
  who are designing impressive patterns (It loves some parts of
  Cabala). It completely ignores Marauders and Nephandi, as they
  never create any patterns it likes.
