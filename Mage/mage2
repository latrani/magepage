He is what I have I figured out about what White Wolf has done to
change the Spheres from 1st edition to 2nd edition.  I don't claim
it's perfect, but it's the best I could do.  For the most part, the
Spheres have become more powerful, while some have stayed the same or
lost some some powers.  Matter seems to have gotten the worst deal,
but even it is a little better than 1st edition.  

Where I have starred (*) an effect, it is a conjunctional effect.  I
have also marked "(speculation)" someplaces.  This is more or less me
thinking aloud.  I also added some corrections where I thought
appropriate.  This outline assumes you know the 1st edition spheres
well or can look them up.  Last, BUY MAGE 2D EDITION.  I want people
who have the book to know what was has changed at a glance, and those
of you who haven't gotten the book should be encouraged to do so.
Some of my comments won't make much sense unless you have Mage 2d in
front of you.
