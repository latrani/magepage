   The Paradigma
  </h1>
  <i>
   by Anders Sandberg
  </i>
  <p>
   This unique item is one of the more unusual talismans in
  circulation, a tool to understand the local paradigm.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Paradigma has no fixed shape, and will change shape to fit
  the paradigm (although it always remains small enough to be held
  in a hand). These changes in shape never occurs when people look
  at it, and will never draw attention to the device.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a hermetic temple, it will be a ornate seal or crystal
  sphere reflecting the secret symbols around it. When moved to a
  technocracy lab it will become a slick electronic device, and on
  a busy city street a small calculator. In a Verbena grove it is a
  small twig with thorns, and near an Euthanatos killing it might
  become a broken piece of bone. And in a Nephandi labyrinth it may
  become a fistful of living, diseased flesh...
  </p>
  <p>
   The item is quite useful to mages who understand how to use it
  for maximum benefit. By adjusting their magick to the paradigm,
  they lessen the risk of paradox, and by carefully studying the
  Paradigma it is possible to notice minute fluctuations in
  reality, making it possible to determine something about what
  mages and what kinds of magick has been in the vicinity. While
  the Paradigma retains its form based on the main paradigm, subtle
  shifts in its appearance may signify other kinds of reality: near
  Nephandi taint the twig becomes dead and diseased, and when
  passing a hermetic mage on the street the calculator displays an
  occult significant number.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is not certain what the Paradigma is, but mages who have
  studied it think it is actually a kind of benign hobgoblin.
  According to one story it was left behind during the Great Quiet
  of Nazdhur-i-Khan (like the Imp of the Perverse and many other
  unusual hobgoblins). Some mages have warned that the Paradigma
  may be more dangerous than it seems.
  </p>
  <p>
   [Studying the Paradigma (perception + enigmas) gives the mage
  insight in the local paradigm and possible loopholes in it. If a
  character understands it, he will more easily find a good
  coincidence to use in a magickal effect, or even an effect the
  paradigm will enforce.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is also possible to use the Paradigma to look for magick of
  various kinds. This can notice the presence of talismans,
  magickal effects, mages or events. It is not completely reliable,
  since the hopes and fears of the mage can influence it (a
  paranoid mage might make the Paradigma react to Technocracy
  presence even when the nearest Man in Black is miles away).]
