   Dr Egon Weinstedt

  <p>
   There are a few mortals who appear in the phonebooks of
  vampire elders and technocrats alike, and Dr Egon Weinstedt is
  one of them. Despite being a mortal human he has managed to not
  only develop an excellent network of contacts among the more
  unusual inhabitants of the city, but also to survive and
  prosper.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dr Weinstedt is an information-broker and powermonger with
  extremely diverse connections, both in the mortal and in the
  supernatural world. Somehow he always seems to know what various
  people need, and can usually provide them with it. A technocrat
  needs to get in touch with some tradition mages for secret
  negotiations; Dr Weinstedt arranges the meeting. Someone has
  stolen a piece of art from a Toreador Elder; Dr Weinstedt can
  probably find out who did it and how to get it back. When the
  anarchs plot a revolt the doctor keeps the Technocracy up to date
  with the latest developments in exchange for inside tips.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dr. Weinstedt doesn't work for anyone but himself, which may
  come as an surprise to many people. His network of contacts
  supplies him with information, skilled professionals and access
  to the most diverse resources. Since he is so useful, his
  contacts have found him much more profitable alive than dead, and
  he is essentially protected by just about everyone; the vampire
  Elders have informally declared him and his properties Elysium
  (although they won't tell this to their neonates), and the
  Technocracy looks the other way when he deals with reality
  deviants. Another contributing factor to his survival is that he
  also seems to have dirt on just about anybody, which makes him a
  dangerous enemy. He might be a mere mortal, but he could probably
  get a lot of support from other powerful contacts if attacked by
  anyone. Still, the fact that nobody has eliminated him so far is
  amazing judging by the dangerous games he is involved in.
  </p>
  <p>
   Weinstedt has few scruples about what kind of people he deals
  with, although he is careful not to needlessly antagonize anyone.
  He doesn't usually deal with the more bestial vampires, since
  they won't recognize prestation and are generally better avoided.
  He has little contact with the garou of the wilderness, since he
  rarely leaves the city. Among mages, he usually interacts with
  the Traditions and Technocracy, since contacts with Nephandi are
  dangerous and seldom useful, and Marauders are frankly too
  unreliable. He generally prefer social and cultured contacts, and
  crude or obnoxious people have a hard time even meeting him.
  </p>
  <p>
   People who meet him never forget him; he is a huge, fat man
  with an insatiable appetite for life and its pleasures. His wine
  cellar is quite extraordinary, and he gobbles down gourmet food
  and smoke expensive cigars as if expecting each day to be his
  last. He is a very jovial person, always happy to offer visitors
  dinner, advice and crude jokes (despite his education and
  actually refined taste, he never miss an opportunity to play some
  tasteless prank on the lowest ranking visitor). Despite his
  clownlike demeanor, he is in reality a brilliant, coldly
  calculating manipulator.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dr. Weinstedt lives alone in a large house, surrounded by a
  surprisingly ordinary garden. Usually his butler Eric is within
  earshot, delivering papers, food and discreetly cleaning up after
  his master's food-orgies. The whole building implies prosperity,
  but hardly any extreme wealth as one would expect from such an
  influential man. Dr. Weinstedt actually doesn't care about money
  very much, he has enough for his needs, and instead gather the
  most precious resource around: information. In his study, there
  are some files in his safe and computer that certain groups would
  be ready to kill for if they knew about them. Other files,
  packets of evidence or objects are hidden away in bank vaults or
  other safe places. But the most dangerous information only exists
  in the head of the doctor.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nobody knows what goals he has, or why he is manipulating
  things. Almost every fraction believe he is working for somebody
  else, but the truth is frightening: he only works for himself. It
  is quite possible that he has no other goal than to remain in the
  game, playing everybody against everybody while he sits in the
  background enjoying the spectacle.
