   The Cabalists are one of the oldest and most influential
  subgroups in the whole Order of Hermes. Their symbolism and
  methods is the backbone of modern Western hermeticism. For
  example, the Seal of Solomon is of Cabalistic origin, as is much
  of the symbols used in the Circle.
   <h2>
    Origin and History
   </h2>
   The Cabala is of Jewish origin, and
  seems to have roots in the magick of the tribes of the middle
  east, combined with Egyptian and chaldean magick. According to
  some Cabalists the tradition was received by Moses on Sinai
  directly from God, but this is unsubstantiated.
   <p>
    The oldest Cabala is known as the Merkabah mysticism, or
  Hechalot (Which means "ascent"). The Merkabah was the name of the
  throne of God in Hebrew, and the aim of the Merkabah Mystics was
  to be able to see God upon his Throne. Little is known about this
  school outside the Order of Hermes and Celestial Chorus. The
  mystics contemplated the early chapters of Genesis and the Vision
  of Ezekiel. To perform the ascent the mystic had to pass through
  the seven palaces of heaven, giving the correct words, talismans
  and signs to the guardians. The Merkabah mystics were quite
  obviously influenced by the Celestial Chorus.
   </p>
   <p>
    During the earliest centuries of the Common Era the Cabala
  used today began to evolve. The books "Sepher Yetzirah" ("The
  Book of Formation") and "Bahir" were written. Greek magick and
  philosophy influenced the Cabalists. They began to interact with
  the Order of Hermes and the Gnostics, a group of mages in the
  Celestial Chorus. During the rise of Christianity the Gnostics
  were purged by the Chorus and branded heretics. Many joined the
  Order of Hermes and the Cabalists. This may have been one of the
  reasons the two traditions fought each other later in the middle
  ages.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Cabalists had become an integral part of the Order, but
  had little influence. They were spread out across Europe, in
  isolated ethnic groups. Then the Order began the experiment with
  the false Order of Hermes. Most subgroups in the Order joined
  forces and began to work together on the great plan. But the
  Cabalists refused, explaining that they thought the plan was
  doomed to fail. The rest ignored them and went along with their
  fateful plan.
   </p>
   <p>
    After the Failure the Order was on the brink of dissolution.
  Many of the subgroups, like the
    <a href="Mage/goetics.html">
     Goetic mages
    </a>
    , were discredited and dissolved. Many mages left
  the Order completely. The Cabalists, who had persistently warned
  the others, suddenly appeared to the disenchanted hermetics as
  the saviours of the Order. Many non- Jewish mages joined the
  Cabalists. Suddenly the Cabalists were one of the most
  influential groups inside the order. Many mages became Cabalists
  and retreated from the world into Cabalistic study.
   </p>
   <p>
    This lead to a renaissance for Cabala. In the fourteenth
  century Moses de Leon wrote Zohar ("The Radiance"), one of the
  central texts of Cabala. Other hermetic mages developed their own
  ideas, using cabalistic symbolism and theories. Cabala became one
  of the cornerstones of the Order, a position it still occupies.
  Cabala expanded and began to dilute, and lost much of its Jewish
  origins. At the same time the Cabala was discredited among many
  Jews after the appearance of a false messiah who actively
  supported the Cabalists.
   </p>
   <p>
    New groups emerged from the Order, like the
    <a href="Mage/enochianer.html">
     Enochians
    </a>
    and
    <a href="Mage/roci2.html">
     Rosicrucians
    </a>
    , who based much of their magick on the Cabala.
  The Order of Hermes continued forward, and the Cabalists
  influence began to wane. It began to return to its roots, and
  became more Jewish again. At the same time Cabalistic methods,
  ideas and symbols had become mainstream in the Order. It is often
  required training for an initiate in the order to understand some
  of the Cabala.
   </p>
   <p>
    Today the Cabalists are an small subgroup, but held in great
  respect by most hermetics. They still exert a noticeable
  influence on the theories of the Order. There are many types of
  Cabalists, ranging form ultra orthodox Jews to secular mages
  happily mixing Cabala, Enochiana and Goetia and performing
  Gematria on computers.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Links to Other Groups
   </h2>
   Cabalists have often had ties to
  the Celestial Chorus, and have influenced their thought too. In
  fact, some Cabalists think of themselves more as members of the
  Chorus than the Order. The Cabalists are the strongest link
  between the Traditions, and often employed as diplomats and
  envoys. There are however a small group inside the Chorus who
  actively work against the Cabalists, perhaps due to their ethnic
  origin or even their old involvement with the Gnostics (which now
  partly have returned to the Chorus to complicate matters
  further).
   <p>
    The Cabalists are conservative hermetics, which mean they do
  not meddle in the affairs of mortals. The point out that every
  time mages have done this, the end result have been disaster.
  Instead mages should spend their time in study, and work to
  understand magick before imposing their ideas on humanity. Most
  mages have only half an idea of what they are going to
  accomplish, and tend to become corrupted when confronted with the
  mundane world.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Ahl-I-Batin and Cabalists have had many contacts, and
  share much of their basic philosophy. There is no sharp dividing
  line between the Batin and the Cabalists, and nobody tries to
  draw any. However, most Cabalists dislike the meddling in mortal
  affairs of some Batin groups, pointing out what happened in
  Europe last time.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Cabalists are not very interested in war with the
  Technomancers. They have a long history of stoically surviving
  attacks from sleepers, mages and the technomancers. Instead of
  fighting, they try to avoid the enemy and wait. Patience is their
  weapon, as they know that whatever may happen, it will not last
  forever. This may be their greatest mistake.
   </p>
   <h2>
    The Cabala
   </h2>
   In the Cabalistic world view, everything is
  symbolic for something else, and the world is filled with subtle
  connections. Even the most trivial text or thing hides deep
  secrets. Using this knowledge the Cabalists hope to understand
  the universe fully.
   <p>
    God created the universe by allowing some of his quintessence
  to flow down, transmutating into the materiel universe. The goal
  for many Cabalists is to understand this process, the universe
  and the way back to God. The idea of God in Cabalism is quite
  complex, and not necessarily religious in character. God has many
  names with different powers ruling over hierarchies of angels,
  but is also a completely abstract entity. Many Cabalists say that
  it is impossible to say anything about the nature of God, except
  possibly what things God isn't.
   </p>
   <p>
    The most important symbol in Cabala today is the
    <a href="file://nic.funet.fi/pub/doc/religion/occult/magick/qabalah/sephiroth.ps">
     Sephirothic Tree
    </a>
    , a diagram consisting of ten spheres
  ("Sephiroth") and 22 paths joining them. This is a kind of
  blueprint for the universe, showing how the quintessence flows
  down into the material world through different levels. Each
  sephiroth represents one type of existence. The lowest. Malkuth,
  the Kingdom, represent the material world. The highest, Keter,
  the Crown, is the source of the unmanifest quintessence. Between
  these there are sephiroth representing for example Force, Form,
  Intelligence and Balance. Each sephiroth corresponds to a number,
  a colour, different names of God and other symbols. The
    <a href="file://nic.funet.fi/pub/doc/religion/occult/magick/qabalah/Yggdrasil.ps">
     22 paths
    </a>
    correspond to the 22 letters in Hebrew and the Major
  Arcana of the Tarot. The system has many similarities to the
  enochian theory.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Tree does not only represent the creation, it also
  represents the human mind. Each sephiroth correspond to a part of
  the mind or soul. Using this knowledge, a Cabalist may use his
  magick to transfer energy from one sephiroth to another to change
  himself or the world around him. For example, a mage wishes to
  temporarily increase his speed of thought. He invokes Hod
  (Splendour, intellectual clarity), using the number 8, the colour
  Orange, Mercury, Cinnamon and the names for the angels of Hod. If
  he had wished to become stronger he would have invoked Geburah
  (mental strength) or Malkuth (physical strength).
   </p>
   <p>
    Another important part of Cabala is the
    <a href="file://nic.funet.fi/pub/doc/religion/occult/magick/qabalah/misc/gematria">
     esoteric study of holy texts
    </a>
    . A text often contains subtle
  secrets, which can be revealed by the mage. Gematria consists of
  calculating the number of a word by giving each letter a value
  (for example A=1, B=2 and so on) and adding this together. This
  number represents the word, and words that have the same number
  have some connection. For example in Hebrew, AChD (Unity)=13=AHBH
  (Love). And 13+13=26=YHVH, the unspeakable name of God.
   </p>
   <p>
    Other ways of finding the secrets in a text is to read only
  the first letter in every word, or every 50th letter. In
  Notarikon, the mage creates acronyms for sentences, or try to
  find the sentences hidden in acronyms. Temura mixes the letters
  according to some rules, like A becomes B, B C, and so on (Avgad)
  or Aiq Bekr, in which the letters are divided into nine
  equivalence classes and exchanged inside these classes. This
  numerology and word magick is often used in constructing
  talismans and words of power, and to hide secrets inside
  seemingly innocuous texts.
   </p>
   <p>
    Cabalistic Magick is often ceremonial like the Enochian
  system, and often more directed toward enlightenment and the
  acquisition of knowledge than practical matters. Many Cabalists
  spend more time studying than performing magick. Still, the
  Cabalists have shown competence in creating useful talismans and
  defences against spirits and malign forces.
   </p>
   <p>
    <a href="ftp://lysita.lysator.liu.se/pub/magick/Qabalah/Others/planetary_talismans.gz">
     Cabalistic talismans
    </a>
    are often pieces of parchment inscribed
  with symbols, names and ciphers. They are often worn as an amulet
  around the neck. They seldom have direct, obvious effects like
  talismans of other traditions. Instead they often help the mage
  perform his magick (for example by lowering target numbers) or
  protect him. The Cabalists are well known for their talismans
  against evil spirits. Typical examples of talismans are talismans
  of health, which help the bearer to recover, talismans of Hod,
  which make the bearer quicker, more businessminded and more
  intellectual and talismans of Michael, giving the bearer
  protection against evil forces.
   </p>
   <p>
    Cabalists are very interested in spirits and their realms.
  Most common is simple scrying into the Umbra, but some Cabalists
  actually travel through it. They are very interested in the
  relation of the Celestines to each other and the world, and try
  to collect as much information as possible about the geography of
  the Umbra. Another area of research are evil or disharmonious
  spirits and realms known as the Qlippoth, or "shells". They are
  thought to be leftovers or flawed parts of the creation, which
  have not yet been recycled.
   </p>
   <p>
    Cabalists often use hierarchies of angels, somewhat like the
  Enochians. The holy names of God are used to call upon angels and
  spirits of different levels. There are angels associated with the
  sephiroth, the paths and different material phenomena. To
  accurately understand and remember the angelic hierarchy is one
  of the most important steps in learning Cabala.
   </p>
   <p>
    Instead of using the common nine spheres, some Cabalists use
  the sephiroth as spheres instead. This means that sephirothic
  magick concentrate on the desired result, not on the exact way of
  achieve it. A normal mage will heal someone by using the sphere
  of life to repair the patients damaged pattern. A Cabalist in the
  same situation would call upon the forces of mercy and health
  (Chochma and Tiphareth) and allow them to heal the patient in the
  best way. If the magick work correctly, both methods will lead to
  the same result. Cabalists tend to excel at static magick in
  their daily lives, and use dynamic magick only in their
  temples.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Philosophy
   </h2>
   As above, so below. The universe is filled
  with connections, both subtle and obvious. Everything, how small
  or trivial it may seem, has some hidden significance. The forces
  which rule the Macrocosm are like the forces which rule the
  Microcosm of man. Study these subtle secrets, which are revealed
  in the holy texts and the dance of the letters.
   <p>
    We will find out way upwards in the Tree, towards Keter and
  the divine brilliance behind the Three Veils. But we will not
  follow the way of the Staff, the path of the Mystic. Instead we
  will follow the way of the Serpent, the path of the Mage,
  balancing the forces of the universe as we progresses. Along the
  way we must help other seekers to find their paths, even if they
  are not parallel to ours. Beware the Qlippoth, for they will
  weight you down and drag you down into the matter.
   </p>
   <p>
    Mankind has its place in the world and a part in the great
  plan. But we mustn't interfere with this, as our destiny is not
  the same as the destiny of humanity.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Organisation and Meetings
   </h2>
   Very informal, if any at all.
  Cabalists are often solitary, and meet in informal ways to
  discuss their latest theories and ideas. Many Cabalists
  communicate only by mail (or using magick).
   <h2>
    Initiation
   </h2>
   The Cabalists seldom have one obvious
  initiation, mentors preferring to guide their initiate slowly
  through several years of study. The mentor often begin by giving
  the initiate texts to translate and analyse, then continues with
  more and more complex problems in gematria and symbolism. The
  initiate slowly understand more and more, until he suddenly gain
  insight in the interconnectedness of the universe. Often the
  initiate swears an oath afterwards, affirming his determination
  to the study of magick.
   <h2>
    Chantry
   </h2>
   The Cabalists have few chantries, but the most
  important lies in Prague. This chantry houses the second largest
  library in the whole Order (The largest is probably Cordoba).
  This library contains many extremely rare tomes, in every
  conceivable language. Especially books from the middle east are
  very well represented. Many mages from other traditions visit the
  Library.
   <h2>
    Acolytes
   </h2>
   Pious Jews, Scholars, Artists
   <h2>
    Sphere
   </h2>
   Spirit or Forces. Many Cabalists study Mind and
  Prime with great zeal. Matter and Entropy is regarded as a bit
  dangerous, and study is sometimes discouraged by other Cabalists.
  Still, many Cabalists have had important insights in the
  structures of Matter and the role of Entropy.
   <h2>
    Foci
   </h2>
   Cabalists almost always use the conventional foci of
  Order of Hermes, mostly because it was they who defined them.
  When using sephirothic magick they prefer to have things around
  them associated to the sephiroth used. A mage using Geburah would
  draw pentagrams, wear red clothes, wield an iron sword and burn
  irritating incense. It is not necessary, but many mages claim it
  makes the magick easier. Often only some symbol for the sephiroth
  used is needed, like an iron knife for Geburah or a golden ring
  for Tiphareth.
   <p>
    <b>
     Language
    </b>
    : Almost always Hebrew, but unorthodox
  Cabalists use Latin, enochian or other languages.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Circle
    </b>
    : Tend to be inscribed with Hebrew names of
  angels, powers and the secret names of God. Often housed in a
  consecrated room or temple.

    Quote
   </h2>
   "Contemplate the secret meaning of the Seal of
  Solomon. The lower triangle is the symbol of fire, and the upper
  triangle the symbol of water. Water and Fire. The Star of David
  show two opposites balancing each other in perfect harmony,
  creating something greater than its parts. It is a fitting symbol
  for the Macrocosm. Notice it has six rays, showing that it
  represent Tiphareth. If you put it on the Tree, its rays will
  point at the planets, with the Sun at its centre. It is a most
  powerful symbol of balance."

   <h2>
    <a name="rotes">
     Rotes
    </a>
   </h2>
   <h3>
    The Yetziratic Sealing Rite (Mind 3)
   </h3>
   Originally from
  Sepher Yetzirach, this rote is widely used for protection. The
  mage draw permutations of the letters Yud, Heh and Vav in the six
  directions with an incense stick while praying. Now the mage is
  protected as long as the rote is active. People around the mage
  will ignore him and will not remember him very well, if at all.
  They will not think about the mage if he does not attract
  attention. This rote became very popular among the Rosicrucians,
  who called their rote the Rose Cross Ritual (In which the mage
  draws crosses instead of letters)
   <p>
    [ The rote will make people overlook the mage. Three successes
  are enough to be ignored by all people in the vicinity of the
  mage. Each success will subtract one die from every perception
  roll to spot the mage, as long as he does not attract attention.
  Since most people ignore each other anyway, the mage will in
  effect be almost invisible]
   </p>
   <h3>
    The Middle Pillar Ritual (Prime 2)
   </h3>
   This rote will
  strengthen the body, mind and soul of the mage. The mage stands
  and visualises himself as the middle pillar of the Sephirothic
  Tree. Below him is the material world, and above his head Keter,
  the source of prime. He feels the energy flowing through him,
  into the world and from the world back to the source. The mage
  will feel filled with power, in perfect balance of mind and body.
   <p>
    [ The mage will pump quintessence into his own pattern for a
  while. This will temporary strengthen the mages own pattern and
  hopefully weaken intruding patterns. Each success will remove one
  success of magick (Both helpful and harmful), like a
  countermagick roll. The target number for the rote is the highest
  sphere involved in the effect + 3, or 5, whichever is highest. It
  will not heal any damage already done nor stop any flaws in the
  mages own pattern. Prolonged use of this rote have been shown to
  cause egocentricity, as the mage unconsciously begin to believe
  he is the centre of the universe. ]
   </p>
   <h3>
    Bless the Faithful Servant (Prime 2 Spirit 2)
   </h3>
   The mage
  blesses a spirit, pouring quintessence into its pattern. This is
  something most spirits desire, as it will make them more powerful
  in the long run. Besides, at least to a human, they seem to
  derive pleasure from it. This rote is often used to thank spirits
  who have helped the mage.
   <h3>
    The Invocation of the Four Archangels. (Spirit 2)
   </h3>
   The
  mage stand with his arms straight out to the sides, so that his
  body forms a cross. He invokes the four Archangels: "Before me
  Raphael. Behind me Gabriel. On my right hand, Michael. On my left
  hand, Uriel. For around me flames the pentagram, and within me
  shines the six-rayed star." By using this rote, the mage will
  scare away most spirits, fearful for the powerful Archangels and
  the powerful mage. The Rosicrucians have developed their own
  version, the Lesser Banishing of the Pentagram, which works in
  almost the same way.
   <p>
    [ The Archangels will normally not appear in person, but will
  (if the mage is lucky) send subordinates to the mage. They will
  not manifest physically, but their presence is often felt. The
  subordinate angels will scare away lesser beings from the
  vicinity. After they are done, they will report back to their
  superiors what happened. It is very unwise to misuse this
  rote.]
