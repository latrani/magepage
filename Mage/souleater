A Friend of the Family: Souleaters in the World of Darkness

By Alexander Shearer (nightgaunt@earthlink.net)

Andeleon's Brood

     "Listen to them -- the children of the night. What music they make!"
          -- Bram Stoker, Dracula

     The first of what the Tal'mahe'Ra would come to call Souleaters were,
     indeed, brought into this world by Andeleon during a trip to the Deep
     Umbra. During one journey to the Deep Umbra, Andeleon happened to
     wander into a gateway to the material realm of the "Souleaters."
     Several of the creatures saw this, and took a moment's opportunity to
     try and expand their realm by spreading into his. Using one of the
     already long-subverted creatures native to their realm as a host-form,
     the "Souleaters" did, indeed, trick Andeleon into partaking of their
     blood. They were fortunate beyond their wildest dreams, however, as
     Andeleon spread their progeny into his progeny, retainers, and
     acquaintances. The Manus Nigrum never did stop the spread in time, and
     these creatures of the Deep Realms made their way onto earth, where
     they now form a conspiratorial group known to very few, and challenged
     by almost no one.

>From the Deep

     ""Any particular reason," he asked, "why you should find blood under
     your fingernails?""
          -- Robert A. Heinlein, The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag

     The creatures known to the Hand as Souleaters have no proper name in
     English, or any other language of the known world. They can be called
     by a sort of literal translation of what they feel they are. In this
     case, they may be called The Family (this makes them sound almost
     mafioso, which really isn't true). This is because all members of The
     Family are, indeed, related. They can all trace their lineage back,
     eventually, to one parent, and there's a lot of, for lack of a better
     word, cross-breeding between them. They most definitely don't come from
     a realm rooted in sciences of which Technomancers would approve. Though
     they keep their origin in that realm (if, indeed, it is in that realm)
     quite secret, even from each other. What they did in this realm is well
     known, however. Everything has been subjugated by The Family, and
     everything is The Family.

     The Family fully intends to expand whenever possible, as it's suffering
     a sort of population-control problem back in the home realm. As it
     stands, however, no one really knows exactly how to find home again, so
     the few Family members who hitched a ride on Andeleon are the
     progenitors of all the other Familia on earth. Hopefully, when enough
     power has been collected by The Family, this problem can be solved.

Family Biology

     "Humans acquire the larvae by eating undercooked meat contaminated with
     cysts, and the worms develop into mature adults. Large tapeworms, which
     may be 20 meters or more in length, can cause intestinal blockage and
     can rob enough nutrients from the human host to cause nutritional
     deficiencies.
          -- Campbell, Biology, Third Edition

     Though they don't have biology in any conventional sense, Familia do
     operate in a certain way (which might come as a bit of a surprise to
     members of the Hand who think they know how "Souleaters" work). An
     example could start pretty much anywhere, but the easiest place is a
     fully-grown Brood (another good Family synonym). Most likely inhabiting
     a kindred body, but also able to exist anywhere else, the average Brood
     is present in every part of their host's body, and have completely
     devoured their host's soul. However, at all times during their life
     cycle, such as it is, Familia contain countless smaller voices, other
     Familia waiting to bud into intelligence (or not, depending on where
     they end up). These splinter-spirits drift off into others when those
     others have the misfortune to taste of the life essence of the Brood
     (that would usually be blood, but in the rare cases of insects and
     plants it would be lymph and phloem fluid respectively). Once this
     happens, there may be several nascent Familia present within the
     infected victim. They expand quickly, imparting their nature to every
     cell of the person's body.

     The foolish Tal'mahe'Ra belief in eyeball-nibbling goo-creatures is the
     result of a series of vicious practical jokes by particularly clever
     Familia early on in the Shadow Crusade. In reality, there is no visible
     change in the body of an infected person. They do, however, slowly (or
     quickly) gain the ability to mold themselves into various forms. It
     doesn't matter whether there is one Brood, or perhaps several. These
     abilities are imparted regardless. However, these Familia are
     antagonistic, and they leave the victim's soul alone until one of them
     can successfully purge the others. This explains the often erratic
     lengths of time it takes for a "Souleater" to be fully possessed --
     they may be waiting, unknowing, for hundreds of Familia to sort things
     out inside their body.

     Once that initial purge takes place, there will be one dominant Brood,
     with a substantial quantity of nascent, presentient Familia forming
     from it. These will then be spread, perpetuating the cycle. It's
     important to note that this doesn't mean Familia don't infect others
     prior to one gaining dominance. If someone is exposed during the
     "sorting out" period, one or more of the weaker Familia will be
     expelled into the newer victim, making the task of control easier on
     both sides.

     Full members of The Family tend to operate as their victim did, with no
     obvious changes except, if they choose to reveal it, the use of
     Viscissitude. Over time, the memories of the devoured soul may fade,
     and this can lead to the strangeness seen in certain users of
     Viscissitude (including loss of memory concerning one's original
     appearance).

     The defensive form of The Family deserves a special note. Known among
     Tzimisce as The Horrid Form, this is a Brood's way of making a vampiric
     body tougher and nastier to deal with. It can differ heavily in
     expression in non-kindred hosts, though all forms share the black,
     alien-like appearance in one way or another. This is not the natural
     form of The Family. As far as even they know, they have no natural
     form.

     Familia have no specific, globe-spanning secret meetings or languages.
     While they may operate this way locally, and devise codes and signs,
     the only universal thing about Familia is their tendency to help one
     another, and their one unique method of communication. Any two Familia
     can talk directly, without need for speaking, gesturing, or even
     Auspex-based Telepathy, by meeting blood-to-blood. This is a simple
     task for kindred, who simply need to have one of them bite the other.
     Truthfully, it's nearly as easy for other Familia, who can open small
     wounds with Viscissitude, then close them when done. The method of
     communication used in this conversation is alien, but could be
     translated with a bit of loss of meaning into very clipped,
     goal-specific sentences: "Problem. Vampires in city. Solution?" Of
     course, these could easily be fleshed out, just like many foreign
     language translations are. Of course, would it seem as creepy then?

The Shadow Crusade

     The Family is hard to fight. They don't control as many people as the
     Tal'mahe'Ra. Of course not. They are that many people. The influence of
     The Family spreads from positions of power it inhabits directly much
     more than that of it's chief enemy, the Black Hand. This doesn't mean
     that vampires in The Family don't exert standard, Jyhad-style
     influence. It just means that there are seemingly human members of The
     Family who occupy government posts directly. The Family can be the
     ultimate Men in Black.

     The Family is a subtle opponent in the Shadow Crusade. Where Hand
     members who directly deal with the Crusade like to go in with guns
     blazing and swords swinging, Familia prefer to arrange things so that
     their opponents are misguided, confused, and eventually go away
     (whether this be death, or simply giving up, the result is often the
     same). There can be a marked sadism in members of The Family, a result
     of their alien natures, and they often do things which satisfy this
     feeling when dealing with opponents. Of course, if a member of the Hand
     can be captured and kept, the most likely option is infection. While
     the Hand can purify Vinculum, they can't prevent the infection of their
     members at a random, unchosen time.

Web of Influence

     "And you cannot measure their width with your overloaded psyche
     Your criminal misgivings
     You have overanalyzed my entire web and yet barely licked the truth"
          -- Sara Dwyer, "Untitled"

     The Family are patrons to seekers of power. This includes corrupt
     lupines, Unseelie and Seelie fae, and best of all, Nephandi. The Family
     represent a controlling agent for a whole passel of Nephandi, intent on
     bringing about a better order by spreading Family influence on the
     earth and eventually bridging the gap between earth and home. Only some
     of these Nephandi are actually infected, though those are the most
     respected. Some refrain from receiving the gift of Viscissitude out of
     the misguided belief that they can keep their souls intact. This is
     pretty much never true, regardless of who the Nephandus works with.

     The Family work together, basically, by not really working in a unified
     form. This is why they're so hard to deal with. The Family is not a
     centralized unit, so the conspiracy is hard to break. They are experts
     in subtle message transfers and slipping out of tricky situations. One
     might catch their unwitting servants, or not-yet controlled victims,
     but a full member of The Family is a tricky bastard indeed.

Being in the Family

     "And why the finished product was an embryo"
          -- Sarah Eggers, "The First Kill"

     Of course, people can play members of The Family in World of Darkness
     games. This is a broad, broad range of people, encompassing pretty much
     every character type in the World of Darkness. What may differ is the
     effects of being a full member of The Family. Until then, things are
     pretty much the same.

Basics

     To actually be a member of The Family, or even to be infected, the
     character must have Viscissitude. Simply purchase the Discipline, at
     the normal cost (or use the varying costs in the Storyteller's Handbook
     to the Sabbat). In a Family campaign, Storytellers may give one (or
     more) free points of Viscissitude, at their discretion. Note that
     should characters not start as full members of The Family (that is,
     still simply infected and not replaced), it is entirely Storyteller's
     choice as to when they convert fully.

Vampires

     The effects of Viscissitude on vampires are pretty well-covered. Note
     that Auspex can not be used to directly discern the presence of a
     Brood, though an alert vampire would certainly discern a drastic change
     in mood if an old friend was suddenly overcome by their infection. Once
     a vampire has become a member of The Family, their Humanity score is
     effectively zero, though they will attempt to act like they always used
     to act. Note that they will also still act as if they had their old
     Virtue levels, though they often expend Willpower to reduce or negate
     frenzies when they are inconvenient.

Werewolves

     Werewolves infected with Viscissitude display the abilities of that
     Discipline, and can change shape with an unsettling fluidity. They will
     almost certainly stand out to mystical examinations as something other
     than completely lupine. They will not be sensed by the Gift of Sense
     Wyrm, but they will definitely smell unnatural, especially if
     completely converted. There is a defensive form for every form of the
     werewolf, including Crinos. This can be truly terrifying. In game
     terms, all of the forms might as well use the attribute modifiers for
     Horrid Form. If the Storyteller feels this is unbalancing, the
     modifiers may always be reduced. Sometimes, a new Brood is unable to
     deal with the Rage which the Wyrm still pushes through their werewolf
     frame, and the Storyteller may feel free to impose a -2 to all target
     numbers for Rage rolls to represent this. Note that a converted
     werewolf may be rejected by spirits, who can sense the creature's new
     status, or denied access to caerns simply by their loss of a link to
     Gaia. Werewolves will consider Familia to be of the Wyrm.

Mages

     Any mage can be infected with Viscissitude, and will be able to use its
     effects if their mind can handle it. Nephandi may be infected as part
     of a Family Rebirth, voluntary or no. Some come for the power, but some
     are unwittingly infected as they attempt to balance power and sanity.

     Fully-converted mages face an iffy future. The stronger their Avatar,
     the greater chance they have of losing their magick. If the mage is
     already tainted, and this has spread to their Avatar, then it will
     succumb to the Brood's control easily enough. If, however, they were
     infected without any other corruption or taint (say, by accident) and
     their Avatar is fairly strong (anywhere from 3-5, depending on their
     own sense of purpose and strength) it may leave them. There is no set
     rules system for this, and it should be a judgement call on the part of
     the Storyteller. Of course, for a Family campaign, it's probably best
     to have the player and Storyteller decide together, depending on what
     they want the game to be like. Note that the use of Viscissitude does
     not, without the influence of True Magick, accrue Paradox.

Wraiths

     No, really. The Tal'mahe'Ra aren't entirely full of it when they speak
     of "Souleater" wraiths. Since the Brood replaces the soul of the
     infected victim, a Brood who is rudely interrupted in the course of
     doing something important may become a wraith with a singularly bizarre
     set of Passions of Fetishes. Of couse, sooner or later some of these
     wraiths will find Enoch. They may already know of it. The only saving
     grace is that wraith Familia can't propagate.

Changelings

     In a word, this sucks. Though the initial infection may seem odd, or
     even interesting to a Changeling, the full conversion drives the Fae
     half completely out, doing it great trauma in the process. Until then,
     very little of note happens.

Mortals

     This includes Tzimisce ghouls. Mortals can have Viscissitude and become
     Familia just as any supernatural creature can. The Family treasures its
     more important mortal members.

Mummies

     It could happen.

Others

     Almost anything can become a member of The Family. In game terms, all
     that's usually required is Viscissitude and a Family attitude.

Roleplaying the Family

     Playing a member of The Family, one should always remember that they
     are playing an alien being pretending to be a member of the World of
     Darkness. For the most part, they are incredibly subtle, and only a
     crisis will make them act at all directly. Just think of the Tzimisce
     -- people think they're odd and cold, but no one thinks they represent
     an invasion force of Deep Umbral creatures. This is a game for people
     who enjoy working within a conspiracy, to be sure.

     The easiest way to play a Brood is simply to act like whatever the
     Brood is supposed to be most of the time, simply remembering to push
     things oh so barely in the direction of expanding and helping the
     conspiracy. Of course, it's important to live a lifestyle that lets you
     infect as many people as possible. Just don't get caught, especially
     not by the Black Hand (unless they're this year's target).

Invasion of the Body Snatchers

     So, the final question. Why isn't the whole world already in The
     Family? Well, though some of the more panicked Hand members might think
     it is, the truth is that the victim's will wins far more often than The
     Family would like. Basically, most casual contacts with Familia-tainted
     blood don't carry more than a few spirit fragments, and this bare
     minimum of fragments may fall before human will, outside protection, or
     a random walk on consecrated ground. This is why the easiest way to
     infect is repeated blood mixing (Vinculum), or full transfusion
     (Embrace).
