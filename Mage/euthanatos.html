   Excerpts from
   <em>
    The Ocean of Dust
   </em>
   , a widely read book
  among Euthanatos. The book contains hundreds of short texts and
  aphorisms without any apparent order about almost everything.
  Versions exist in several languages, often with significant
  differences. Its author and original language is unknown.
   <p class="c1">
    Entropy:
   </p>
   <p>
    Entropy is fundamental. It is more fundamental than time and
  space. It is more fundamental than matter and energy. It is more
  fundamental than life and death. Entropy is that which drives all
  things, the force which turns the great wheel of existence.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Change:
   </p>
   <p>
    Entropy is the force of change. When something changes, it
  will increase the entropy. When entropy increases, something will
  change. Without entropy, the universe would be dead, unchanging
  and purposeless.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    The Wheel:
   </p>
   <p>
    The Wheel turns. As one part rises, an other part must sink.
  There can be no life without death. There can be no light without
  darkness. There can be no success without failure. The Wheel must
  have two sides to be a wheel.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Evolution:
   </p>
   <p>
    Some believe that evolution is the opposite of entropy. They
  are wrong. Evolution work by weeding out the weak, ineffective
  and the unlucky, giving space and food for others. Without
  entropy, evolution would grind to an halt.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Life:
   </p>
   <p>
    Some believe that life is the opposite of entropy. They are
  wrong. Life is entropy. Life needs entropy. Life cannot exist
  without entropy. Nourishment, water and air is used and become
  waste. It is by this steady flow of order into disorder that life
  can exist. Life is the ripples on the edge of the waterfall, as
  the water fall down into the abyss below.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Matter:
   </p>
   <p>
    Matter is the lowest stable form of existence. A living being
  will some day become inanimate matter. Matter may become a living
  being again, but after a time it will become matter again.
  Everything of matter will one day return to matter. Everything
  will one day become matter.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Energy:
   </p>
   <p>
    Energy is change or potential change. But when something
  changes, entropy will increase. The energy will become a little
  bit more degraded. Otherwise it wouldn't be able to effect any
  ordered changes. Soon the energy will be dissipated, hopefully
  doing useful work. Only heat will remain. And the heat will
  dissipate.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Spirits:
   </p>
   <p>
    Some say the spirit world is without entropy. They are lying.
  The world of spirits is a place of great changes. And change is
  entropy. Spirits are beings from outside of the world. They
  cannot exist without it, feeding of its entropy as we do.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Awakening:
   </p>
   <p>
    Every being is awakened once in its lifetime - At the moment
  of dying. It will see beyond the illusions of its existence and
  pass into a new existence. Unfortunately almost all choose to
  forget that moment. It is our task to awaken those who are ready,
  and make others ready.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Creation:
   </p>
   <p>
    Once force and form crystallized from the pure quintessence.
  From the purposeless forces and the malleable forms matter and
  energy were created. &gt;From the dead matter life arose. From
  the mindless life mind was created. This evolution was driven by
  entropy. Entropy let the quintessence become force and form. It
  will let them return to pure quintessence when their time has
  come.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Destruction:
   </p>
   <p>
    Entropy will in time destroy anything, how eternal it may
  seem. One day a stone will be dust. One day you will be dust. One
  day the Earth will be dust. "This is evil" many say. They do not
  understand why everything must disintegrate into lower forms.
  These forms will also disintegrate. Finally, everything will have
  disintegrated into its component parts This will be part of new
  forms. Plants feed on the dust of stones. Worms feed on the dust
  of men. Who knows what might feed on the dust of worlds?
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Time:
   </p>
   <p>
    Scientists say entropy always increase as time passes. This is
  wrong. Time passes because entropy increases. We prefer to see
  time as we do, because we are living beings, living on entropy.
  We may see time in other ways, in other directions. But this is
  not useful, for we are beings of entropy. We choose the direction
  of time we perceive as the direction Entropy increases the
  most.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Fear of Death:
   </p>
   <p>
    Death is the great change which all living beings must pass.
  Life must lead to death, as light creates shadow. Many fear
  death, try to ignore it, try to hide from it. It will always
  come. They fear it because they do not see what is behind it, do
  not see its purpose. They only see darkness where there is light.
  We must show those who are ready the way into the abyss. Those
  who are not ready must be helped to loose their futile grips on
  the edge. They only waste their precious time and energy left by
  struggling.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    The Kia:
   </p>
   <p>
    The Kia is almost eternal. It will create a soul to inhabit.
  The soul will create a spirit to inhabit. The spirit will create
  a body to inhabit. The body, spirit and soul will die and
  dissolve again, but the Kia will pass on.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Reincarnation:
   </p>
   <p>
    The Kia and fragments of previous spirits, souls and bodies
  will pass through countless incarnations, accumulating
  experiences and losing them. Some experiences will be useful, and
  will be remembered. Others will be useless and will be forgotten.
  Some lessons will be hard, and may take hundreds or more
  incarnations to learn. Many beings forget what they have learnt
  in an instant, and start over again.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Balance:
   </p>
   <p>
    Entropy is a force of balance. When something is unbalanced,
  it will change. It may change in many ways but eventually it will
  become stable. If there is balance, entropy will sooner or later
  overturn it. There must be a balance of balance.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Randomness:
   </p>
   <p>
    There is no laws of randomness, only the play of the small
  forces. These forces are what remain of the forces, beings and
  things that entropy has claimed or will claim. A dice is thrown;
  the scratches on its surface, the turbulence in the air and the
  trembling of the caster will play their game to decide which side
  will come up, as entropy drain the energy of the dice and it
  stops rolling.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Rigidity:
   </p>
   <p>
    Some people try to make themselves or their work eternal. They
  are all fools, and will fail. Entropy will claim everything in
  the long run. But the forces of rigidity will disturb the flow of
  entropy, destroying the balance between destruction and creation.
  They will never give up their place voluntarily, crushing and
  hindering everything that may topple their pyramids. The balance
  must be restored.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Stability:
   </p>
   <p>
    Stability is an illusion. Nothing will persist forever, as
  entropy slowly nudges it towards destruction. Some phenomena
  persist long enough for humans to say: "This is stable, and will
  remain long after I am gone." Fools! Mayflies say: "This straw of
  grass is eternal, and will remain long after I am gone!"
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Illusions:
   </p>
   <p>
    Every being surrounds itself with comfortable illusions.
  Without illusions the unawakened cannot live. Break down some of
  their illusions and they will die, go mad or awaken. Even if they
  die they will have lost nothing, as their Kia will go on and
  create a new soul, spirit and body. If they die in the right way
  and at the proper moment, they will remember some of the
  truth.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Duality:
   </p>
   <p>
    Two opposites is always caused by a third, more fundamental
  phenomenon. Light and Darkness is but two sides of the same coin,
  and exist only as two extremes of illumination. Life and Death
  are the top and bottom of the great wheel. Everything has its
  opposite, and stems from something more fundamental. This thing
  stem from yet another thing, and so on. Entropy divides
  everything into opposites. That is the act which create the
  universe.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Existence:
   </p>
   <p>
    The dance between Existence and Entropy creates the universe.
  Entropy will divide existence into smaller things, and these into
  yet smaller thing. It will force them to change, creating time.
  Without Existence, nothing would exist. Without Entropy only pure
  Existence would exist, nothing more.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    The Good Death:
   </p>
   <p>
    The greatest gift that can be bestowed upon any living being.
  If it dies in the right way when it is ready, its Kia will be set
  free, with a part of the beings soul and spirit. In this way it
  will perhaps remember some of its lessons this life the next. But
  do not give the Good Death to the unworthy, lest they remember an
  existence best left forgotten.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Undeath:
   </p>
   <p>
    Some beings leave the wheel of life and death, sacrificing
  everything to exist forever. The body which rises from the grave
  is the same that was put therein. The spirit which rises from the
  grave is the same that was put therein. But the soul and Kia is
  not the same. The undead have unknowing lost their souls and
  Kias, which will continue to incarnate as before. Instead they
  have gained a shard of something else's soul. They still remember
  their life before death, and believe they are the same person as
  before. They are perfect impersonators of themselves. This is
  indeed a most grim joke.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    The Awakened:
   </p>
   <p>
    The Awakened have broken down some of the lesser illusions,
  and proudly proclaim their enlightenment. Many do not wish to
  search further, to risk breaking their new illusions. The
  greatest illusion of all is that one have freed oneself from all
  illusions. This is also an illusion.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Magick:
   </p>
   <p>
    Those who have seen through the illusions need not follow
  them. This the uninitiated will call magick. Remember that magick
  might be useful, but it is not the truth.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Madness:
   </p>
   <p>
    Be careful when judging the deranged. They might see further
  than you in their confusion.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Afterlife:
   </p>
   <p>
    Many humans delude themselves with the idea of an afterlife.
  When they die, their dissolving spirit will hallucinate the
  heaven or hell they expected. They will be punished for imagined
  sins. They will be rewarded for imagined virtues. They will
  dissolve inside their own illusions.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Perfection:
   </p>
   <p>
    Everything strives for perfection. But when perfection is
  achieved, it will not last. Perfection will sooner or later
  crumble, only to be replaced by something else. The quest for
  perfection begins anew.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Will:
   </p>
   <p>
    The earthly lusts and desires of your body is not your true
  will. The mercurial ideas and feelings of your spirit is not your
  true will. The deep needs and unknown movements of your soul is
  not your true will. Your true will is part of the Kia, which is
  indivisible. Your true will cannot be broken. Your true will
  cannot be found.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Mages:
   </p>
   <p>
    The mages have seen the Truth. All of them. All mages have
  seen their Truth through the illusions, and believe they have
  seen the One Truth. They believe all other mages have only seen
  an reflection or an illusion. All mages believe themselves to be
  chosen ones, seekers of the One Truth. We know better. We know
  the Truth.
