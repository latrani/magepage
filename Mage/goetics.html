   The Goetia
  </h1>
  <h5>
   By Anders Sandberg
  </h5>
  <hr>
   The Goetic mages are a small sub-tradition of Order of Hermes
  today. They had their heyday during the late middle ages, but has
  since then almost vanished. Their magick is directed towards the
  mastery of the spirits, especially demonology. Needless to say,
  their interest in the darker beings have given them a bad name,
  which has contributed to their decline.
   <h2>
    History
   </h2>
   It is unknown when the Goetic arts was invented.
  According to the tradition, it was founded by King Solomon
  himself. He was given the power over the spirits on and below the
  Earth by God, and used them to do his bidding. Among other
  things, they were used to build parts of his Temple. He
  imprisoned some of the most malicious, and learned the secrets of
  the spiritual world. After him, a long succession of mages have
  studied his secrets and passed them on. However, it was not until
  the middle ages the Goetia began to flourish. Its influence was
  profound on the Order, and from this time most of its important
  books date, like the Lemegeton "The Lesser Key of Solomon", Liber
  Honorius, Grimorium Verum and many others.
   <p>
    The ceremonial system of the Goetia was heavily used by the
  lesser order of Hermes, and the Goetic mages were major
  supporters behind the plan. But their success in the lesser order
  became their fall. As their power and numbers grew, many of them
  became corrupted by demonic forces. This was the beginning of the
  fall of the order, as it resulted in internal conflicts and
  attacks from the Church. While the Goetic mages were not solely
  responsible, they were intimately involved with the problems, and
  when the lesser order dissolved, the Goetic mages were scattered
  for the winds. Many became the victim of witch hunts or attacks
  from other mages, and inside the Order of Hermes they were used
  as scapegoats for the Fall.
   </p>
   <p>
    After the Fall, the Goetic mages went underground. Most hid as
  members of other hermetic orders or practised their arts
  solitary. They have remained very few up to date, and in most
  cases transmitted their knowledge from master to apprentice for
  generations with no outside influence. This sub-tradition is one
  of the most archaic of all groups in the Order, and their methods
  are distinctly medieval.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Theory and Magick
   </h2>
   The Goetia is coloured by the Christian
  beliefs of the middle ages in demons and angels, organised in
  strict feudal hierarchies. Modern goetic mages are somewhat more
  flexible, but tend to rely on the old tried and tested systems
  anyway. Overall, Goetic magick is very ceremonial and strict,
  with a very medieval feel, and many Goetic mages tend to rely on
  old rotes instead of new inventions. This is of course a bit
  limiting, but many of the old rotes have surprising power.
   <p>
    Goetic mages are very interested in spirits, demons, ghosts,
  elementals and angels and how they can be controlled. They do not
  plead with the spirits like the dreamspeakers, nor do they obey
  them like the Enochians. Goetic mages order the beings, bind them
  to certain tasks and generally use them as their servants. They
  are however very mindful of the fact that many of the beings are
  more powerful than them, so they protect themselves with
  elaborate circles and rotes. Many of the rotes and ceremonies
  contain extra precautions to make sure the summoned being will be
  on friendly terms and the mage will be safe. These are however
  not always sufficient, and many Goetic mages have perished after
  dealing with forces too great for them.
   </p>
   <p>
    The spirits and beings they summon are often very specialised.
  In their grimoires are long catalogues of different entities,
  their powers and how they may be summoned using different seals,
  incenses, sacrifices and incantations. The mage then summons the
  spirit, using the exact procedures described. The being is then
  threatened, ordered or otherwise persuaded to perform the
  magickal effect the mage wants. Sometimes, especially when
  summoning more powerful beings, the mage has to make deals with
  them. These may range from small services or sacrifices to the
  proverbial selling of the soul.
   </p>
   <p>
    Using the specific rituals described in the grimoires the mage
  can summon specific beings in a specific form to do specific
  tasks. This is in a way a charade, since the summoned being can
  in general appear in any form or be almost anything; however, by
  performing the ritual exactly as described, the mage and the
  beings bind each other in a kind of covenant, forcing each other
  to "play by the rules". The spirit will appear in its classic
  form and perform its traditional services. If the mage uses a
  slightly wrong ritual or leaves out a detail, the spirit is
  correspondingly more free, and may react accordingly. However,
  this freedom is partially limited in a complex way by the
  remaining ritual. If the mage uses the wrong incense, for
  example, the spirit may refuse service and threaten the mage, but
  nothing else. If the mage breaks the circle, the spirit is free
  to leave. An error in the seal may cause the wrong being to
  appear, or it to appear in an unusual or dangerous form.
   </p>
   <p>
    Changing a ritual to suit the mage is a complex and often
  dangerous problem. It is often necessary to modify the rituals to
  suit the modern times, since their classic forms are prone to
  paradox. Having a lion headed man appear out of the air riding on
  a bear followed by 30 minstrels is not a good idea. Many rituals
  can be reworked to become coincidental, so the spirit manifests
  as something more safe, like a black limo with a sharply dressed
  businessman or a bird landing outside the window. This type of
  changes are dangerous, since the mage risks making the spirit
  more unpredictable and free by straying from the traditional
  methods.
   </p>
   <p>
    When summoned, most spirits prefer to manifest only
  spiritually in the near umbra. The mage will see them, but nobody
  else. It is quite hard work to make them manifest physically
  (generally needs Matter 2 or Life 3 to create a body if the
  spirit is not willing or able to manifest), but it gives them
  much more power on the physical plane. The more powerful spirits
  choose what to do by themselves, and can even break through the
  magickal barriers the Mage has erected if he fails in the exact
  protocol of the ritual.
   </p>
   <p>
    Making the spirits obey is a major problem. There are no fast
  rules, the mage has to find the method that works in each case.
  Lesser spirits can often be coerced, threatened or fooled into
  doing whatever the mage wants. More powerful spirits are harder
  to control. Some mages use threats, especially threats of other
  spirits of beings. Other mages try to persuade the spirit,
  sometimes resorting to bootlicking. Some mages just order them
  around. Most mages try to strike deals with them instead. Some
  spirits may want sacrifices in exchange for service, ranging from
  small items (like Bechard, who wants nuts), over small animals
  (Astaroth has a taste for mice) to human sacrifices. Another
  commodity most spirits want is Tass. Finally, many spirits want
  the mage to perform services to them in exchange. This works a
  bit like the vampiric system of prestation, where the part who is
  indebted have to treat the other part with respect and do lesser
  services for them. Being indebted to a spirit can be quite
  useful, since the spirit will protect the indebted person as long
  as he is useful. Some mages have used this to their advantage by
  playing several patrons against each other. It is a dangerous
  game, since spiritual politics is even harder to follow than
  vampiric politics.
   </p>
   <p>
    Most Goetic mages spend much time talking to the lesser
  spirits, trying to gain information and knowledge. This is
  tiresome, since they are often not very smart, tend to lie a lot
  and generally lack deeper knowledge. However, the more powerful
  beings demand higher prices for their services and may be quite
  dangerous to summon.
   </p>
   <p>
    Paradox is another major problem for the Goetic mages. Once
  their spirits could manifest physically in whatever forms they
  desired and do the bidding of the mage without problems. But now
  they are severely limited by paradox. They seldom manifest
  physically, and it is hard to command the spirits without gaining
  paradox. Modern mages have alleviated this problem somewhat by
  making deals with certain spirits to watch them, and perform
  their services when the mage gives a sign. This can often be done
  coincidentally, but the mage must pay the price of the
  spirit.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Philosophy
   </h2>
   "There are more things in heaven and on earth
  than in your Philosophy, Polonius!" We have seen the secret
  powers behind what appears as blind forces. We have seen the
  secret hierarchies who control the world. We know the signs and
  words which bind and give control. Most people, even mages, do
  not want to see, or even think of this side of reality despite
  the fact that it pervades everything. That is too bad, since if
  you don't dare to see it, they will be playthings for the Powers
  That Be.
   <h2>
    Organisation and Meetings
   </h2>
   Goetic mages have never
  accepted the elaborate organisational structures of the rest of
  the Order. They tend to be solitary, jealously guarding their
  secrets from each other. Sometimes two Goetic mages meet, and
  trade information during tense negotiations. The only way to
  really learn the secrets of the Goetia is by being apprenticed to
  a Master. The apprentice is expected to perform menial tasks and
  help the Master with his projects, just like apprentices did
  during the middle ages.
   <h2>
    Initiation
   </h2>
   In the old days, many members were awakened by
  making a deal with a spirit. The master performed the summoning,
  and the initiate was confronted with the spirit. It was not
  uncommon for the spirit to test him, or demand some service in
  exchange for becoming his benefactor. Today Goetic mages usually
  awaken the initiate by performing a great ceremonial summoning of
  the initiates avatar to appear into a visible form as his
  guardian spirit. They are linked by exchanging a drop of blood.
   <h2>
    Chantry
   </h2>
   Goetic mages seldom have their own chantries. In
  the old days each mage just built his temple on a suitable node,
  or stayed in an Order chantry. Today, most of them reside with a
  chantry.
   <h2>
    Acolytes
   </h2>
   Librarian, Thrill-seeker, medievalists.
   <h2>
    Sphere
   </h2>
   Forces is the main sphere, but Goetic mages often
  study Spirit with equal or even more zeal. They see the forces of
  cosmos not as impersonal principles but as actual beings, which
  may be bargained with. A goetic mage will see a fire as an actual
  being which may be threatened or ordered to do things, like
  attacking somebody. Outside these two spheres, Goetic mages have
  no typical interests and study according to their personal
  preferences.
   <h2>
    Foci
   </h2>
   Almost the same as for the rest of Order of Hermes.
  Since they are so involved in Spirit, many mages have their own
  permanent Circles, often engraved into the floor and reinforced
  by metal. Outside of the Circle is the Triangle of Art, similarly
  inscribed. It is inside the Triangle spirits manifest, and they
  can't leave it without the permission of the mage.
   <p>
    Instead of a traditional showstone, many goetic mages use a
  black mirror, in which spirits often manifests. When a summoning
  has been done, the mage can see the spirit inside the mirror if
  he directs it towards the Triangle.
   </p>
   <p>
    Beside these essential foci, most goetic mages use other
  secondary foci. Elaborate robes, staffs, weapons, incenses,
  altars and tools are used in their magickal work. These range
  from the practical, like the pen and ink used in taking notes and
  drawing seals, to the symbolic swords inscribed with powerful
  seals to keep angry spirits at bay. The foci may not be bought,
  they must be made by the mage or his acolytes for only magickal
  purposes and then consecrated in long ceremonies.

  without leaving any evil smell behind thee. Be mindful, however,
  of our engagement, for shouldst thou fail in it, even for a

   <h2>
    <a name="rotes">
     Rotes
    </a>
   </h2>
   <h3>
    The Code of Tritheimus (Mind 1)
   </h3>
   This rote is often used
  to keep the secrets in the grimoires from the eyes of unworthy
  and enemies. By writing using specially prepared inks and during
  incantations of angelic names, the mage can write an completely
  undechyperable text. To an uninitiated, it will look at sheer
  gibberish or mad rantings of demoniac names, but if another mage
  incants the names and read the text in the light of certain
  candles, it will become readable. This is used to hide the Goetic
  texts, sometimes in plain sight.
   <h3>
    Ring of Protection (Mind 2)
   </h3>
   This is a practical little
  rote used to avoid being controlled or influenced by hostile
  beings or magick. The mage enchants a ring, making it a symbol of
  the infinite power and protection of God. It is then worn as a
  protection against hostile attacks during summonings, and when
  the mage is attacked, he will kiss the ring and hopefully regain
  his senses. [Each success will give an extra dice on Willpower
  rolls to resist temptation, mind control or Mind magick. After
  all dices are used up, the ring must be recharged. ]
   <h3>
    The Blasting Rod (Spirit 3 Forces 3 or 5, Prime 2)
   </h3>
   This
  rote uses a hazel staff, which is used to punish disobedient or
  aggressive spirits. The mage releases flashes of force against
  beings in the umbra while he is still in the physical world,
  damaging or driving away spirits. It is very effective way to
  force spirits summoned into the Triangle to obey, as many cannot
  leave until given permission and the mage may beat them to
  submission.
   <h3>
    Bind Servitor (Spirit 2 Matter 3)
   </h3>
   This ritual allows a
  summoned being to inhabit a material object, like a knife, a
  statue or a fire. The being will gain the power to use the object
  as a body; a statue will be able to move, a knife will be able to
  stab or slip away, a fire will be able to choose whether it will
  burn somebody or not. The ritual must be done during the creation
  or reshaping of the object, to make the link to the spirit the
  strongest. Sometimes mages divide the ritual process into parts,
  and perform certain stages on the right days.
   <h3>
    Magickal Barrier (Spirit 4)
   </h3>
   This ritual creates a
  magickal barrier which no spirit may pass. Instead of the normal
  Circle, the mage draws or marks the barrier (using chalk, stones
  or other available materials), draws the necessary seals at
  strategic positions and performs a powerful ritual to make it
  impregnable.
   <h3>
    Consecrate Circle (Spirit 4 Prime 2)
   </h3>
   This ritual is used
  to consecrate a Circle and/or Triangle to make it easier to
  summon spirits into it. Usually it is done by sacrifices to the
  invisible rulers of the spirit world, and long incantation of
  god- names. [ Each success will decrease the gauntlet inside the
  Circle and/or Triangle with 1 ]
   <h3>
    Imprison Spirit (Spirit 4)
   </h3>
   This rote was reputedly
  invented by Solomon himself. The mage orders (or lures) the
  spirit into a bottle, box or other space and then seal it with
  wax and the seal of the spirit or the mage. The spirit will be
  imprisoned in the vessel, and cannot leave until the seal is
  broken. Some mages have also thrown crystals or scrolls of
  parchment through the manifestation of the spirit, but this
  method is much less reliable.
   <h2>
    <a name="elem_sum">
     Elemental summonings
    </a>
   </h2>
   The
   <a href="Mage/elementals.txt">
    elementals
   </a>
   are the spirits inhabiting the physical world.
  They are generally not very bright and quite specialised, but
  often quite useful to a mage. Using just level 1 of the required
  sphere (Matter for Earth, Forces for Fire, Life for Water and
  Mind for Air), the mage can contact the spirits inside an object
  (like a stone or a ocean). With level 3 they can manifest
  physically. They can be regarded as minions. The number of
  successes in the summoning will show how powerful or how many
  elementals the mage has summoned. With 5 or more successes, the
  mage may summon the elemental kings (Paralda of Air, Djin of
  Fire, Niksa of Water and Ghob of Earth). They have considerable
  power, but are also quite good at bargaining with the mage.
   <h3>
    Summon Gnome (Spirit 2 Matter 3)
   </h3>
   This ritual is used to
  summon one or more of the elementals of Earth, the gnomes. The
  mage fills the Triangle with sand, mud and stones and chants one
  of the elemental prayers in addition to the normal rituals.
  Unlike most summonings, they prefer to manifest physically, often
  as small men and women made out of clay and earth (not too unlike
  Terra Firma, which some Goetic mages claim is their king Ghob).
  They are stubborn, practical and somewhat lazy creatures, who has
  full knowledge of anything pertaining to the earth, like ores,
  gems, hidden treasures and caves. They are masters of shaping
  tools, jewellery or other artefacts.
   <h3>
    Summon Salamander (Spirit 2 Forces 3)
   </h3>
   The mage places
  source of fire inside the triangle, like a brazier, and chants
  the prayer of the Salamanders. The spirit will manifest half
  physically inside the flames, as odd movements and suggestions of
  a lizard like shape. Salamanders tend to be aggressive,
  passionate beings with absolutely no patience. They are
  knowledgeable in everything involving fire, forces and
  destruction, but also purity and transformation.
   <h3>
    Summon Sylph (Spirit 2 Mind 3)
   </h3>
   The Sylphs usually
  manifests as scented winds or changing, suggestive shapes barely
  seen. They are very fond of illusions, playing games with people
  and fooling the mage (and due to their intelligence they are good
  at it). It is not easy to make them behave seriously, but if the
  mage manages to make them behave, they are quite good at
  everything pertaining to air, illusions, music, language etc.
  They are also excellent, if somewhat unreliable, spreaders of
  magickal gossip and crafters of illusions, not to mention their
  spying abilities.
   <h3>
    Summon Undine (Spirit 2 Life 3)
   </h3>
   To summon the undines,
  the mage places water inside the Triangle and chants the prayer
  to the Undines. They tend to manifest as ripples in the water, a
  dampness in the air and if the mage forces them to manifest more
  clearly, as beautiful, seductive women made of water or ugly
  fishlike things. They are a bit treacherous, but also very
  emotional beings. They have a strong affinity for life and
  growth, and knows much about the living world not to mention
  everything in water. They can influence the emotions of others,
  cause fertility or infertility and control water in its different
  forms.
   <h2>
    <a name="dem_sum">
     Demon Summonings (Spirit 2)
    </a>
   </h2>
   This is
  the classic type of Goetic magick, the ritual summoning of demons
  to do the mages bidding. In its classic form, as described in
  Clavicula Salomonis and other grimoires, all the instruments and
  clothes used must be carefully consecrated and the ritual
  performed at an astrologically suitable moment. The seal of the
  spirit the mage wants to summon must be inscribed in the Triangle
  or a parchment, suitable incenses lighted and incantations read.
  The mage invokes the powers of the Almighty to force the spirit
  to emerge and obey the mage. Below are some typical demons (their
  seals have been omitted, see "The Book of Black Magic" by Waite).
  When the being first appear, it will appear in its "true" form as
  required by the ritual, but the mage can command it to appear in
  a more pleasing form (and often the spirits change voluntarily to
  avoid paradox).
   <p>
    [The more powerful the summoned being, the harder it is to
  summon. The base difficulty is 5, but this is increased by the
  power and rank of the demon (se below). As a rule, weak or rather
  powerless beings increase the difficulty with about 0-1,
  presidents and marquises 2-3, princes and dukes 4-5 and more
  powerful beings 6+. To decrease the difficulty, goetic mages use
  quintessence, sacrifices and often try to do their summonings at
  astrologically favourable times and at places which fit the
  summoned being (se below).
   </p>
   <p>
    The number of successes needed to force a being to appear
  varies, but are normally about the same number as the difficulty
  increase. To summon a duke 4 or five successes are needed, while
  a lesser spirit will appear after just one. If the being doesn't
  appear, all is not lost. It will probably have noticed the
  summoning attempt, and will often either come itself or send a
  subordinate being (if its powerful and/or busy). As a rule of
  thumb, if the mage manages to get half as much successes as
  needed, the being will contact him. However, the general
  disposition can vary, especially if the being felt that the
  summoning was sloppy or impolite. ]

   <h2>
    Angelic Summonings
   </h2>
   These work almost exactly as demonic
  summonings; the evocations and seals are different but the normal
  procedure with circle, triangle and seal is identical. Angels are
  generally more easy to deal with, but have often much more
  specified and "good" powers. Among goetic mages angels are
  preferred as teachers and demons and spirits for practical works.
  However, not all angels are peaceful or truthful, and the mage
  better watch himself when summoning one of these beings.
   <h2>
    Making summoning easier
   </h2>
   Sacrifices have always been
  useful, and by sacrificing something (or someone) the summoned
  being likes, the mage can get some extra goodwill. Blood is a
  traditional sacrifice for summoning ghosts, and many demons like
  sacrifices of snakes, cats and other living beings. Angels
  generally prefer aetheric essences, flowers or expensive balsams.
  Elementals love substances fitting to their own element (like
  sacrificing ambra or fish to undines or gasoline to salamanders).
  Tass is always a hit.
   <p>
    Another way to ensure success is to perform the summoning at a
  place which fit the summoned beings. For summoning ghosts,
  crossroads, graveyards and haunted buildings have proven useful.
  Sylphs can be found at hilltops or any other place where the wind
  is strong. Undines are naturally summoned by lakes, rivers or the
  sea. Gnomes in caves or woods, and Salamanders at great fires,
  volcanoes or in deserts. Angels are of course attracted to holy
  places, while demons to unholy or pagan places. Nodes are of
  course very useful, especially if they fit any of the above
  types. Certain beings have their own preferences, like Astaroth
  who is more present in America than in Europe, or Hazthoragoth
  who only will appear if summoned inside a stone circle.
   </p>
   <p>
    Finally, astrological means to determine time can be very
  useful. Each day in the week corresponds to one planet, and
  magick compatible with that planet will become easier (Love
  magick is for example easier on Fridays, while death magick on
  Saturday). The same is true to a lesser extent about the hours of
  the planets (each day and night is divided into twelve planetary
  hours). Other times, like full or new moon, eclipses,
  conjunctions and the equinoxes are also powerful. Some beings are
  easier to summon on certain days, like ghosts at Halloween and
  angels at Good Friday.

    Talismans
   </h2>
   <h3>
    Mirror of Shades (Spirit 1)
   </h3>
   This is a blackish-grey
  mirror made of old glass. Its rather unreflective, and things
  reflected in it will appear as indistinct shadows. But spirits
  will appear clearly. It is both a window out in the near Umbra,
  and into, so the spirits can see the real world in the mirror
  (but not spirits).
   <h3>
    Sceptre of Command (Spirit 2 Mind 1,2)
   </h3>
   This golden
  sceptre will give the mage a nimbus of regal power and dread to
  most lesser spirits, who will obey orders out of fear. The
  wielder can generally scare away most minions, or order them to
  do his tasks. It will also protect him from mental attacks from
  spirits and other beings.
   <h3>
    Protective seals (Spirit 3)
   </h3>
   These five seals are small
  disks of bronze with a symbol inscribed. When placed in a
  pentagram around a place, they will make it much harder for
  spirits to enter, both through the gauntlet and through the
  material world. They will also counteract any Spirit magick
  inside, and make all spirits inside feel very uncomfortable.
   <h3>
    The Ring of Solomon (Spirit 1,2,3,4)
   </h3>
   This ring was
  according to the legend given to Solomon by the Archangel Raphael
  himself, and gives the wearer power over all demons and spirits.
  It is a golden ring, set with a blazing ruby in the shape of a
  pentagram. It is extremely powerful, but also dangerous since it
  is easy for the wearer to summon far to powerful and devious
  spirits to him. The devil Asmodeus fooled (according to the
  legend) Solomon to take it off, and then the spirit stole it,
  took the kings shape and throne and threw him out in the desert.
  It took the king over 13 years to retake his throne and imprison
  Asmodeus.
   <ul>
    <li>
     Spirit 4: Imprisonment. The wearer can imprison a spirit in
    an material object, like a flask or a stone.
    </li>
    <li>
     Spirit 3: Command. The wearer can give a command to a
    spirit present, and it will be forced to obey it (at least to
    the letter) as long as the wearer wears the ring.
    </li>
    <li>
     Spirit 2: Summon. The wearer can summon any spirit to his
    presence by naming it and ordering it to appear.
    </li>
    <li>
     Spirit 1: Sprit Sight. The wearer will always see any
    spirits in the vicinity in their true form, regardless of how
    they try to hide.
    </li>
   </ul>
