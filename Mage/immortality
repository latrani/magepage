Immortality and Mages
 
Vampires are infamous as ancient, undying beings, but with the powers at 
their command, it would seem that mages should be equally immune to 
aging and death.  There are several spheres of magick that could grant 
immunity to age.  If this is the case, why aren't there more ancient 
mages running around and influencing the world?
 
There are several simple effects that slow or even halt aging.  Any of 
Life 3, Entropy 4, Time 4, or a Time 3 Life 1 Rote will do.  These Rotes 
are well known to many Traditions, and if a mage cannot perform the 
magick herself, she is likely to know someone who can.  Most of these 
Rotes are preventative in nature, keeping the mage at her current age.  
Rotes designed to reverse aging and return a mage to youth are 
correspondingly more difficult.
 
Some Traditions, the Dreamspeakers and the Euthanatos in particular, 
find this sort of magick to be an abomination.  They council against it, 
saying it weakens the Avatar and prevents the mage's eventual Ascension.  
This does not prevent individual members of these Traditions from 
succumbing to temptation as they feel the encroaching weakness of age.  
The Technocracy also has an official policy against such magick, but 
exceptions are made for its more powerful and influential members.
 
Immortality is in fact a trap for mages, and a subtle one.  Initially, 
anti-aging magick can be made coincidental, but as the mage grows older, 
this becomes increasingly difficult.  Once the mage's actual age exceeds 
his physiological age by several decades, immortality magick is always 
Vulgar.  Unaging mages almost always have some lingering Paradox in 
their Pattern (about a point per decade).
 
Once the mage exceeds her natural lifespan, having lived about a 
century, she finds that her very existence becomes Paradoxical.  Paradox 
backlashes of any kind tend to try to correct this state, by rapidly 
aging the mage a few decades.  The mages can usually survive this kind 
of punishment, but it can take some time to recover from this damage.  
Such mages tend to become extremely paranoid about Paradox.  They spend 
more and more of their time in the Near Umbra where their magick is 
coincidental, venturing to Earth only on important occasions.
 
Once a mage reaches two centuries in age, he is such an aberration that 
he can suffer damage from Unbelief while in the physical world.  Any 
Paradox backlash, no matter how small, will attack the mage's most 
Paradoxical aspect: his age.  Even backlashes from other nearby mages 
can effect him.  Paradox will always revert the mage to his natural 
state, that is, a corpse dead for more than a hundred years.  Even the 
Near Umbra is too dangerous for such an aged mage, and he is forced to 
dwell in the Deep Umbra or in specially prepared Horizon Realms.  A 
bicentential mage will only venture to the physical world under the most 
dire circumstances, for a single mistake will mean his instant death.
 
Thus, as a mage remains young for more unnatural lengths of time, he is 
slowly forced further from the physical world deeper into the Umbra.  
The process is so gradual that few mages realize what is happening until 
it is too late.  One day the mage realizes that she is so far removed 
from the Realm that she is no longer a player in the War for Reality.  
Her existence is restricted to some spiritual half-life.
 
Some such mages struggle on, refusing to recognize the futility of their 
existence, and working through younger mages whom they mentor in Horizon 
Realms.  Others give up their physical form, fade, and truly become 
spirits.  A few slay themselves, in the hope that they will reincarnate 
within the Realm and once more walk the path to Ascension.
 
The more practiced immortal magi seek to circumvent the Paradox-trap.  
They use innumerable trick to fool Paradox and remain within physical 
reality.  Many of those tricks involve the darker sorts of magick, such 
as body-stealing, or deals with infernal spirits.  Even these mages are 
only buying time.  Paradox is not a fool that can be confused with 
parlor-magick, and it will find the mage in the end.
