    The attention level of the community was significantly higher
  than average: on the order of 15.892 times higher than would
  normally be expected under such circumstances (according to NWO
  Standard Reaction Analysis Document 0032718, on file.) I believe
  this is due to advance work by Intruder's employees, who spread
  several rumors about the organization well before it's
  arrival.
   </p>
   <p>
    A precis of several rumors I heard in my stay in Freeland
  follows:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Reverend O'Meagan is a healer. He has made the lame walk
    and the blind see.
    </li>
    <li>
     The Revival Show is running out of money, but Reverend
    O'Meagan refuses to charge any admission.
    </li>
    <li>
     Reverend O'Meagan is a fake and a charlatan.
    </li>
    <li>
     Reverend O'Meagan can perform miracles.
    </li>
    <li>
     Reverend O'Meagan knows things nobody else could possibly
    know.
    </li>
   </ul>
   These are contradictory and varied enough that the
  heightened interest can be accounted for according to the Rumor
  System Paradigm.
   <p>
    When Wednesday arrived, I proceeded to the Revival Show to
  surveil. There was a large tent set up outside the town. Parking
  was $2. Neon lights in the shape of a cross were at each corner
  of the tent. Garish paintings of various Biblical scenes were
  done on each square of canvas (This unit is cleared for Biblical
  investigation under General Investigation Order
  0010100110101011-01010-010-1). I entered the tent to find that
  folding chairs were set up facing a large low wooden stage with
  low ramps leading up to it on all sides. A schematic is appended
  as Attachment 000000010:
   </p>
   <p>

   </p>
   <p>
    I immediately performed a scan for Anomalous Paradigmal
  Perturbations using a 992-717 unit and discovered nothing usual.
  The readout is appended as Attachment 000000011:
   </p>
   <p>
    (Attachment 000000011 deleted for space)
   </p>
   <p>
    Soon the tent was filled with inhabitants of the community:
  families, individuals, many of whom, disturbingly, were not
  regular churchgoers. After a wait of 16.7721 minutes, the stage
  lights came on and the lights over the audience went down.
   </p>
   <p>
    The choir, which a scan revealed only to be ordinary
  musicians, began singing a loud, boisterous hymn. After three
  such songs, the one identified as "Sister Ruby" (an obvious
  pseudonym) introduced Reverend O'Meagan. The Masses were
  extremely excited by the music, and were applauding in a rousing
  manner when "Reverend O'Meagan" took the stage.
   </p>
   <p>
    Intruder's physical description is that of average height
  (within .001 standard deviations), average weight (within .001
  standard deviations), blue eyes, dark brown hair, moderate
  complexion and average-class build. Intruder wore a sequined blue
  jacket emblazoned with glow-in-the-dark crosses, a grey flannel
  work shirt and black slacks. He carried a Bible and gesticulated
  with it as he spoke.
   </p>
   <p>
    A transcript of Intruder's words follows in Attachment
  000000100:
   </p>
   <p>
    (Attachment 000000100 edited for brevity:)
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    "Those
    <em>
     lawyers
    </em>
    back in
    <em>
     New York City
    </em>
    don't
    <em>
     want
    </em>
    you to trust Jesus. Those
    <em>
     bankers
    </em>
    over
    in
    <em>
     Los Angeles, California
    </em>
    don't
    <em>
     want
    </em>
    you to
    trust
    <em>
     God
    </em>
    . They want you to work for them so that they
    don't have to. They want you to bring them food so they don't
    have to go. They want you to
    <em>
     FAIL
    </em>
    ...so that
    <em>
     THEY
    </em>
    can
    <em>
     SUCCEED
    </em>
    . BUT!
    <p>
     God takes care of his own. God knows who has faith and who
    doesn't. The Holy Book
     <em>
      promises
     </em>
     that God will take
    care of his children and Ladies and Gentlemen of Freeland,
    Iowa, I stand before you tonight and I say to you that although
    the lawyers may break their contracts and the bankers may break
    their word of honor that GOD DOES NOT BREAK HIS PROMISES!"
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   Intruder's speech was punctuated with shouts from
  the choir and from the audience. In many situations, he would
  elicit responses from the audience: "Amen" (6 times),
  "Hallelujah" (6 times), "Praise God" (4 times), "Praise Jesus" (4
  times). The excitement level of the crowd was exceptionally high.
  It should be noted that at no time did the Reality Stress
  Perturbation Apparatus register anything above background levels.
   <p>
    After 56.7271 minutes, Intruder stated the following:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    "I feel God moving in Freeland! I feel the power of the Holy
    Spirit moving towards your needs!"
   </blockquote>
   He then began indicating members of the audience and
  several of their unfulfilled resource needs:
   <p>
    Mortgage (7 times), Family Matters (6 times), Illness (6
  times) Crop Illness (4 times), Miscellaneous Money Matters (8
  times, each one enumerated in full.)
   </p>
   <p>
    The audience's excitement level skyrocketed: each indication
  was apparently totally accurate. Note that there was
    <em>
     no
    </em>
    ,
  repeat, zero Reality Stress Perturbations during this period.
   </p>
   <p>
    24.17823 minutes passed, during which the choir and Intruder
  kept the crowd at a fever pitch. Then he made the claim that the
  problems he named could only be solved through the power of God.
  2.71 minutes passed, in which he built up to a major climax, and
  then shouted that he felt the healing power of Jesus in his
  fingertips, and leapt into the audience. Finally, there was some
  indication on the Reality Stress Perturbation unit. I also used
  the Life Sign Indicator Unit 09091-82 to determine exactly what
  was happening.

Crop Blight         Immediate cure                .00021 (several cases)
   </pre>
   As you can see, this is a terribly low reading, but all
diagnostics indicated that the Perturbation unit was operating to
within .00001 units of accuracy. It was then that I realized the
full danger of this offshoot paradigm: it fosters such powerful
belief that it reduces Perturbation temporarily.
   <p>
    What's more, at the end of the meeting, after the donation
  cans were passed (they collected $9,721.72), the Mental
  Aberration Quotient of the crowd measured at 6927173.72 times
  higher than it had when they went in. The DEI unit started to
  report malfunctions and I was forced to leave the area
  immediately.

    The Reverend Alfred O'Meagan is a thorn in the side of the
  Technocracy and the Celestial Chorus. The Technocracy despises
  him because he goes about restoring the faith and belief in God
  on which the Chorus was founded in the Dark Ages. The Chorus
  despises him because he fights dirty, often using no magic at all
  to do his work, ignoring Chorus cant about "The One" and "all
  religions being the same" and "the need to take care of the
  Sleepers." He considers it a fair trade to take a town's money
  and leave it hope instead. In the most extreme cases,
  Technocratic influence over a community can be lost temporarily
  due to the re-emergence of Faith. O'Meagan has singlehandedly
  given True Faith to 18 people since he began his organization 5
  years ago, and he himself doesn't have one single bit. He is very
  difficult for the Technocracy to fight: if any arrive to
  countermagic him, he simply "goes Sleeper" for a night, and
  darned if the result isn't the same...
