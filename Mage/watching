(Sung to the tune of The Police's "I'll be Watching You.")

----------------------------------------------------------
*WE'LL BE WATCHING YOU*

sung by The Reality Police


Every breath you take
Every countermove you make
Every rule you break
For reality's sake
We'll be watching you

Every single day
Every word you say
In every Node you stay 
Every night you play
We'll be watching you

Oh can't you see
We own Reality
How your paradigms break
With every step we take

Every move you make
Every law you break
Every Rote you make
Every Chantry you take
We'll be watching you

Since we have power you're lost without a trace
On every street corner you see our face
Our Paridigm is one you can't replace
You might as well take the vampire Embrace
And you'll be begging, let us join you please

Oh you're screwed, you see
Like the Cult of Ecstacy
How Paradox makes you ache
With all the Magick you make

Every discovery you make
Every Barrier you break
Every Umbral excursion you make
Every scheme half-baked
We'll be watching you

Every move you make
Every step backwards you take
We'll be watching you
