   Gericault Freres
  </h1>
  This small shop, located at Rue de la
  Manticore 3 in Paris, is one of the best places in Europe to find
  magickal supplies. In the tiny shop window a few silver
  ceremonial knives are on display, together with a jumble of
  books, curious flasks, astrological tools and incomprehensible
  artefacts. A small sign tells the reader that the shop buys and
  sells "esoteric antiques and tools". The inside is a mixture of a
  small second hand bookshop, antiques store, new age shop and
  workshop (Antoine, one of the brothers, is a strong believer in
  making or repairing as many things as possible by hand). Behind a
  desk covered with stained papers, books, astrological charts and
  an unwieldy armillary sphere sits Theodore, the other brother, a
  small bespectacled man who seems to be constantly reading
  something or other.
  <p>
   The shop sells just about everything a ceremonial mage may
  need: ritual tools, robes, chalks, medals, incenses, parchment,
  various substances and arcane artefacts. Things can be made to
  order, and the brothers are scrupulous in following the
  directions regardless of how bizarre they may seem. If the
  brothers have not got what a customer wants, they can usually get
  it through their wide network of connections (which seems to
  extend to the strangest places). If you need a staff of aspen
  wood cut with a single cut from a northerly branch on a Thursday,
  chalk from Antarctica or a human bezoar stone, they can get
  it.

   That the shop continues to exist is a economic miracle, since
  one would expect that it is too specialised to get any customers.
  Still, the steady trickle of occultists and mages from the more
  ceremonial traditions like the Order of Hermes and Verbena seems
  to be enough to keep it afloat, and the prices are reasonable
  (that doesn't mean things are cheap; where else can you get a
  working astrolabium today?).
