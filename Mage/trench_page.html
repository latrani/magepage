   Trenchcoater Paradigm

   <h2>
    The Paradigm
   </h2>
   <b>
    WHAT paradigm?
   </b>
   There is this world,
  and there is the next (possibly Metropolis). Many trenchcoaters
  associate Metropolis with Hell; some believe there's a secret
  much more infernal than that. Anything that threatens this world
  is from the next world, and since the TC is the only one who can
  see the danger, it's his responsibility to deal with it.
   <h2>
    Magick
   </h2>
   <b>
    Weirdness
   </b>
   (coincidental) or
   <b>
    Magick
   </b>
   ,
  usually Ritualistic (vulgar); a.k.a. the
   <b>
    Dark Art
   </b>
   .
   <p>
    Trenchcoaters are paradoxically both the most classically
  "magickal" and the most anti-magickal beings in the world. While
  they are Awakened and know that magick is real in the world, they
  fear the costs associated with pursuing the power.
   </p>
   <p>
    Coincidental magick is created by the PLAYER and perceived by
  the CHARACTER as the lingering weirdness of his life. A TC
  doesn't really have any control over the weirdness of his life
  until Arete 6 or so.
   </p>
   <p>
    Vulgar magick is STRICTLY ritualistic, based on whatever
  training the Trenchcoater can finagle from his supernatural pals
  in the world. Trenchcoaters seek out spells from Tremere
  vampires, the Garou, occultists of all flavors, old books,
  gypsies, mummies -- anyone willing to teach them a piece of the
  Dark Art. Any vulgar effect MUST be a ritual/rote.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Spheres
   </h2>
   (VULGAR ONLY -- all coincidental effects are
  categorically weirdness, and out of the control of the
  character): most trenchcoaters understand that ritual magick is
  limited only by their imagination. As they need to learn more of
  the Dark Art, they describe the desired effect, not the so-called
  sphere (which are just tradition inventions anyway). Sometimes
  they are surprised that their current understanding of ritual
  magick will allow them to create multiple effects.
   <p>
    <b>
     Correspondence
    </b>
    :
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Level 1: depending on the Tradition from which this level
    of ritual magick is learned, it is the Mind's Eye (Akashic,
    Hermetics, Euthanatos, Verbena) or Gaia's Guidance
    (Dreamspeakers, garou). It has been technologically replicated
    by the Virtual Adepts as a radar image or a ray-traced virtual
    model, viewable via VR goggles.
    </li>
    <li>
     Level 2: one version or another of clairvoyance (many names
    but it's always the same kind of thing).
    </li>
    <li>
     Level 3: teleportation. Hey, call it what it is.
    </li>
   </ul>
   ...and so on...
   <h2>
    Arete
   </h2>
   <b>
    Weirdness
   </b>
   Directly associated with the
  Trenchcoater Effect, a trenchcoater's "weirdness" (for lack of a
  better descriptor) defines the extremity of the odd coincidences
  that surround his life. For some Trenchcoaters, weirdness tend to
  increase or collect around their lives. Trenchcoaters with high
  Weirdness (6+) begin to take control of their coincidences based
  on their knowlege of the Dark Art. Trenchcoaters with a level
  lower than this can attempt to control a coincidence at an
  increased difficulty of (6-arete), but still need some kind of
  focus. Note that, unlike other Traditions, this understanding of
  Arete is more passive, an implicit acceptance of synchronicity
  and weirndess into the TC's life and NOT necessarily an
  "understanding of reality". Well, actually it IS a greater
  understanding of Reality -- but for TCs, reality is a series of
  intricately interlocking events and synchronicities. For more on
  this, check out The Celestine Prophecy.
   <h2>
    Ascension
   </h2>
   <b>
    WHAT ascension?
   </b>
   You've heard hard-core
  Tradition mages bandy about the idea, but then again you've heard
  vampires talk about Golconda, too. Probably an abstract state of
  nirvana or some bullshit like that.
   <h2>
    Quintessence
   </h2>
   This is a null value to a Trenchcoater.
  Unless they have somehow learned how to draw "magickal energy"
  from Tass (for the purpose of creating radically powerful ritual
  magicks), the concept of quintessence as a measure of "realness"
  is irrelevent. Also, if they're going to use Tass, it has to take
  on a classically "magickal" appearance -- potions, mushrooms,
  crystals, etc.
   <h2>
    Paradox
   </h2>
   <b>
    the Cost
   </b>
   . Rather than seeing magick as a
  transaction of quint within reality, Trenchcoaters view "paradox"
  as the cost of the Dark Art. While some smallish rituals will
  slip by the Spirit Guardians/Fallen Angels/Gods who watch all
  magickal transactions, they always incur the Cost. Sometimes the
  weirdness surrounding the TC will itself inflict a Cost. The Cost
  is almost always to those around the TC, not the TC himself.
   <h2>
    Mage-specific Backgrounds
   </h2>
   most of the weirdness
  surrounding the Trenchcoater is written off as the "Trenchcoater
  Effect."
   <ul>
    <li>
     <b>
      Arcane: The Trenchcoater Effect/Creepiness
     </b>
     . Part of
    the overall condition of the Trenchcoaters, this is a highly
    refined mix of attitude, body language and lifelong sneakiness
    designed to keep the Trenchcoater hidden from direct view and
    the world at large.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Avatar: The Trenchcoater Effect/Weirdness Magnet
     </b>
     .
    This appears to be a variable condition with no contiguous
    pattern between subjects or generations. The stronger the
    Trenchcoater Effect, the stronger the "weirdness magnet" that
    surrounds the Trenchcoater, and the more spectacular their
    ritual magicks.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Destiny: The Trenchcoater Effect/Focus
     </b>
     . This aspect
    of the Effect keeps the Trenchcoater focused on his life
    mission (if he has one, and most of them do), allowing him to
    achieve greater feats of skill than average people.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Dream: The Trenchcoater Effect/Gestalt
     </b>
     . This allows
    Trenchcoaters to tap into the whispering collective of
    knowledge shared by all intelligent life. This talent is often
    required when performing ritual magick.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Node
     </b>
     : this is an irrelevant concept to most
    Trenchcoaters. For those deeply entrenched in their magickal
    studies (usually hermetic), this is just a node.
    </li>
   </ul>
   I hope this gives you a fair approximation of how I view
  Trenchcoaters and their "paradigm." In short, I think the loftier
  concepts of paradigms and ascension are -- at least in the
  supporting literature -- left to the tradition magi. Mysticism is
  A Bad Thing, as is most everything associated with magick,
  because of the inevitable Cost to the Trenchcoater (see paradox
  above). Trenchcoaters, then, are very down-to-earth types who are
  drawn into occult activities against their will and know how to
  use magick as a tool.
