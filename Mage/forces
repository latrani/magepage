About Forces (v2.0)

Why change the Forces sphere? The division between "higher" and "lower"
forces in Mage is quite arbitrary, and often counter-intuitive; one would
expect a hermetic mage to be more at home with manipulating fire than
electricity. And there are no explanations why a force is high or low,
other than a general sense of its "power". Is sound a high or low force? 
Since it can be viewed as movement of air molecules, it would be a high 
force, on par with radioactivity, gravity and heat. But this is an 
extremely technomantic explanation, and completely counter to the 
paradigm of most traditions. In fact, Forces is the only sphere which is 
based on technomantic reality in its structure.

What Forces really deals with is energy. Forces are pattern which cause 
or catalyze change of other patterns, they are inherently dynamical. They 
do not necessarily have to correspond to forces or energy as acknowledged 
by the Technocracy; to a Verbena the wind is a force living in the air. 

My new system divides forces into physical forces and abstract forces. A
physical force can be experienced directly; electricity, sound, fire and
light belong to this category. You can see, feel and smell them, they are 
in some sense physical objects. A hermetic mage would say they are material.

Abstract forces control the others or are properties of objects or reality
itself; gravity, momentum, heat, movement, pressure or pure, non-material
forms of the physical forces. You cannot see or touch momentum, heat and
pressure can be felt only by their actions, not in themselves.  Note that
this division is of course completely non-scientific. 

In this new system, a hermetic mage can throw the archetypal fireball with
Forces 3 Prime 2 (although the damage would be as per Forces 3). The Ball
of Abyssmal Flame works not by vibrating molecules (all hermetic mages
know that the democritian idea of atoms is silly anyway) but by creating
pure elemental Fire, although a Son of Ether might do something similar by
creating heat. In this way hermetic mages can manipulate the four
elements, first by manipulating their physical powers, latter by
manipulating them themselves. 

Technomantic forces are a bit troublesome; I would say radioactivity is an
abstract force, since it cannot be perceived normally. The same is true
for infrared and ultraviolet light, and radio waves IN THE HERMETIC
PARADIGM (note that you can still see in the dark using Forces 1, since
darkness is a physical force). A Son of Ether regards them as completely
physical, and would regard fire as an abstract force ("its plasma, not
fire!"). How much individual paradigm should change things depends
entirely on the Storyteller and what fits the story; in some cases it
doesn't matter, sometimes it would be detrimental to the story, and 
sometimes it gives the traditions additional depth.
