  <h1>
   Omega 14
  </h1>
  <i>
   by Anders Sandberg
  </i>
  <p>
   This painting, created in 1936 by the Norwegian artist Bengt
  Mölle, is one of the more unusual paintings in the world.
  The eccentric Mölle sought to capture the image of the
  Unknown, and usually tried to create under the influence of
  strong drugs and teosophic rituals. However, in the case of Omega
  14, it was based on an intense dream he experienced after having
  painted and discarded 13 other paintings the same day, going to
  bed dead tired and quite drunk.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the dream he saw a great, lifeless plain, and on that plain
  an object that was both a palace, a being and a symbol and at the
  same time neither. The great object loomed over him and the rest
  of reality, filled with unknown power.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next morning he created his painting; in a matter of
  minutes he had drawn the basics, and spent the next month
  perfecting it. During this time he only dreamt about Omega, as he
  called it, seeking a way into its secrets. Using his painting as
  a map he eventually found a way into Omega - and vanished
  forever. The painting was sold from his estate when he was
  eventually declared dead; the police never found any clue to his
  disappearance, although they suspected suicide.
  </p>
  <p>
   Actually, Omega 14 is a manifestation from the deep Universal
  Subconscious, a kind of entity far beyond our reality that
  reacted to the artistic probings of Mölle and gradually
  followed them into the physical world. Unfortunately, the
  artist's obsession and the unknown entity's inexperience with
  physical existence trapped it in the painting; as a kind of
  desperate escape attempt it drew in Mölle into itself, into
  the painting. His Avatar is now trapped inside Omega and the
  painting, both struggling to get out.
  </p>
  <p>
   To most viewers Omega 14 is a impressive surrealist painting,
  not that different from some of the more dissolved creations of
  Dali but quite compelling. The contrast between the dry, parched
  landscape in the foreground and the huge, bluish-red-green thing
  in the background is pleasing and suitably disturbing. But the
  picture actually changes over time. The dark, dry clouds slowly
  drift over the painting over the span of weeks, and parts of
  Omega moves when nobody is looking. Mages and sensitive beings
  usually feel the presence of somebody or something when near the
  painting, but it indistinct and often mistaken for other
  presences.
  </p>
  <p>
   To truly come to life the painting needs quintessence, and it
  will siphon it from the surroundings if free quintessence ever
  becomes available, such as the painting being placed near a node
  or touched by a mage. The Avatar of Mölle desperately seeks
  to escape and unfold again, enmeshed within Omega. One way would
  be to fuel the painting with enough quintessence; the trapped
  entity would be able to manifest physically. Unfortunately this
  would require huge amounts of quintessence, and would cause a
  major paradox storm.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mages can also enter the painting, using Mind or Spirit. Omega
  seeks contact with the Universal Subconscious again, and might
  lure others into its world. From the inside the painting is vast,
  although largely a wasteland of windswept, dry clay and
  foreboding clouds. The only life is Omega, an immense baroque
  building-god. It cannot communicate, and the mind of Mölle
  is long since destroyed, but the Avatar may speak with the
  Avatars of mages, giving them hints, visions or strange
  coincidences.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is unwise to enter into Omega, since the being cannot
  resist the lure of absorbing another person in a desperate
  attempt to find a way into the subconscious (which it thus closes
  for itself). Just touching the substance of the being is safe,
  but also floods the mind of the toucher with visions ripped from
  the universal subconscious, Mölle and countless viewers of
  the painting; this makes even the most serious Quiet look tame.
  At the same time it may give some hints of the true story of
  Omega.
