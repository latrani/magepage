      Arete
     </span>
    </b>
    <p>
     What is Arete? It is one of the most important concepts in
  Mage, and of course there is almost no explanation. After some
  thought I have come up with this definition: Arete is a measure
  of how much the mage understands reality. A mage with high Arete
  understands how reality works, how it influences him, how he
  influences reality and himself. He will see how he and the world
  reflect each other. A mage with low arete don't understand how
  everything connects together, and is filled with the same
  illusions as most sleepers. As he increases his understanding, he
  will comprehend more and more of reality, thus gaining power over
  it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The spheres of magick are just amassed information about the
  known rules, patterns and phenomena of different aspects of
  reality. A mage with Prime 1 will know some about how
  quintessence flows, telltale signs of its presence and how to
  manipulate it somewhat. Note the difference between arete and the
  spheres: Arete is understanding, spheres are knowledge. That is
  why spheres can be studied and discussed easily, but not arete.
  To be able to use (or even learn) the spheres you have to have
  some understanding of reality beforehand, otherwise it is just
  meaningless information (knowing how a car works doesn't make you
  a good driver).
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
     <span class="c1">
      The Seeking
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, what happens when a mage begin to increase his
  understanding of reality? Each step on the path towards
  understanding removes the mage one step from the rest of
  humanity, or even the other mages. They are tempted with power,
  both over themselves and over the outside world. They cannot see
  the goal, or even if there is a goal. But still most mages try to
  understand the world. It is something they need, almost in the
  same way as a vampire needs blood or a werewolf must serve Gaia.
  Many mages try to deny the need, and hides it under different
  guises, but it is there, undeniable.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first steps after Awakening are easy. The mage slowly
  learn more about how reality works, and about himself. As he
  progresses, deeper and deeper truths are revealed. The path
  becomes harder. Each step will require more and more from the
  mage, and he becomes more removed from the rest of humanity. What
  was once a simple quest for understanding will now require
  sacrifices. At first, the mage must give up his old, comfortable
  preconceptions about how the world works. He will realise that
  strange powers influence everything, that the world does not
  always make sense and that he is himself filled with illusions.
  The world will become stranger and stranger. Later he will be
  forced to see himself as he is, a very painful experience. He
  have to confront his demeanour, and see his real self behind the
  mask. Later on the path, he must overcome his flaws and his
  nature, transcend his normal personality altogether. He must
  realise how he is imprisoned in his own illusions about who he
  is, and somehow break out of the illusions. Later he may even
  begin to question his essence.
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
     <span class="c1">
      The Outer Struggle
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     The inner struggle towards understanding is reflected in the
  outer struggle towards external knowledge ("as above, so below".
  Everything reflects everything else). At first, the mage learns
  the magick of his tradition. Slowly he masters the philosophy and
  ideas of his tradition, while he also gain the knowledge and
  power to shape reality in different spheres. Finally, he will
  understand the full extent of the ideology of his tradition. But
  the fall is hard, as he begins to realise that his ideology does
  not explain everything, that some things are outside its reach
  and that it contain subtle contradictions. The mage must make the
  painful decision between remaining loyal to his tradition, or try
  to find his own path.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those who leave their traditions philosophies behind, either
  become introvert, seeking the answer inside themselves, or try to
  learn the true meaning of magick. These seekers often try to
  perfect their magick or search out the Oracles for guidance. They
  hope to find truth inside their magick. This path of Mastery is
  most common among pattern mages, like Order of Hermes, Sons of
  Ether and Verbena. The introvert seekers, the mystics, try to
  understand reality by seeking the clues inside themselves or
  their experiences. This is often a solitary path, as they spend
  most of their time studying their own minds and souls. The path
  of the Mystic is the most common path among ex-members of the
  Akashic Brotherhood, Celestial Chorus, Dreamspeakers and Cult of
  Ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
     The groups of Masters around the Oracles study the limits, and
  beyond, spheric magick. They try to understand how magick and
  reality interact, and how to overcome the limits they see. The
  Master may leave his old preconceptions about magick behind,
  realising that spheric magick is just another way to see reality.
  He will become an Oracle, in a way a second Awakening. The step
  from master to Oracle is exceedingly painful, as the mage must
  discard almost everything he has ever believed in or hoped for.
  Most Masters will never reach this level, since they are too
  bound to their old prejudices or content to play with their new
  powers without having to pay the price of true understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Oracles have transcended spheric magick, fully realising
  their potential over reality. They are extremely powerful beings,
  hardly human any more. They have powers beyond the comprehension
  of lesser beings, but also responsibilities and problems of the
  same magnitude. They cannot explain their understanding to any
  lesser being, and they have definitely lost touch with anything
  resembling normal reality. In effect, they have become gods (and
  maybe some of them even take the place among the celestines). But
  they have not yet understood everything. Many Oracles are content
  with their almost unlimited power, but some make the painful
  realisation that they have done the same mistake twice, and see
  the emptiness in their understanding. They start to seek to unify
  themselves and reality, they start to seek the answers
  within.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the most advanced Oracles turn towards the path of the
  Mystic, the most advanced mystics realise that they have
  understood only part of the truth. They turn outwards again,
  seeking the path of the Master. This level of the seeking is
  impossible for anybody else to understand.

      Oracles and the Ascension
  War
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Why don't the Oracles help their traditions in the Ascension
  War? One obvious answer is that they have left their traditions
  and
     <br>
      have no loyalty to them. But if the Technocracy is such a threat
  against Ascension, why wouldn't they interfere anyway? There are
  many possibilities, take your pick:
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     The Oracles have realised that the Ascension War is a trivial
  little affair, it is just entertainment and training for the
  lesser mages which they need to test themselves. Or the Oracles
  have become so alien that they simply isn't interested in helping
  the lesser mages.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Oracles can't interfere. Perhaps they have become so
  powerful and alien that they no longer can work in static reality
  anymore. If an Oracle would appear in the world, just his
  perceptions would be so different that he would be destroyed or
  removed by paradox. Perhaps they can manifest in the world, but
  not with their full powers. They must manifest in a lesser form.
  Perhaps Christ was a manifested Oracle.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Oracles are fighting in the Ascension War, its just that
  they fight above the heads of everybody. They magick is so
  powerful and subtle, that nobody below their level even can
  perceive it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Oracles know that if they interfere, they would do even
  more harm. They must remain inactive to protect reality.
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
     <span class="c1">
      Ascension
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     What happens when a mage reaches total understanding (Arete
  10+) is unknown, and probably unknowable. Many call this
  Ascension, and see this as the goal (this view is prevalent among
  the Akashic Brotherhood, Marauders and the Gnostics). But many
  traditions believe in a global Ascension, involving the whole of
  mankind, like the Reconciliation of the Celestial Chorus or the
  Singularity of the Virtual Adepts. The Enlightened Ones will
  probably take a part in this, the traditions believe. But these
  ideas about Ascension are mere speculation, even if the
  traditions hotly deny it. Nobody really know what the Ascension
  truly is, except perhaps the Enlightened Ones.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Enlightened Ones have transcended everything. Perhaps they
  have ceased to exist, merged with the universe or remain in
  eternal balance, waiting for the time when they shall return.
  Perhaps they have never existed, and the whole idea of personal
  Ascension is a myth.
    </p>
    <p>
     The whole process of enlightenment is exponentially harder and
  more painful. Each step is more than twice the last step. Many
  mages fail, and instead of continuing on the path, they stop and
  remain at their level indefinitely. Some even lose their
  enlightenment, fleeing backwards into comfortable illusions when
  confronted with the harsh light of Understanding.

      Arete in the game

    <p>
     In game terms, I treat Arete as follows:

    <p>
     <b>
      <span class="c5">
       1-3
      </span>
     </b>
     The mage has understood the
  basic principles of his tradition. He can use the simplest types
  of magick, and has reached some self-knowledge. To advance
  further, he must overcome himself more and more. Many mages
  change demeanours during their seeking towards the next levels.
  Many mages never manage to rise above this level, and remain as
  lesser mages.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      <span class="c5">
       4-5
      </span>
     </b>
     The mage apparently masters
  the external world. Many mages think they have reached a deep
  understanding of themselves. Most mages on this level have risen
  far into the ranks of their tradition. The seeking has become
  very hard, as the mage must not only overcome the flaws of his
  nature (note the elegant bind here: if the mage roleplays his
  nature, complete with flaws, he will be awarded more willpower
  and experience. But if he tries to overcome his flaws, he will
  not gain this. It is tempting to step of the path.) To raise
  Arete on this level, the quests can take years.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      <span class="c5">
       5-6
      </span>
     </b>
     The mage has mastered his
  tradition (maybe not in knowledge, but in understanding). He is
  powerful, and apparently at the height of his power. Many mages
  on this level are leaders of their traditions. But he will begin
  to see the flaws, inconsistencies and outright errors of his
  tradition too. To continue the path, he must take the painful
  step away from his tradition, loosing the support and help it
  once gave. This may take a lifetime. Many mages never do this,
  and remain here, trying to lead their
     <br>
      traditions. This is probably as far as roleplaying is possible,
  the later levels are too hard to imagine.
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      <span class="c5">
       6-7
      </span>
     </b>
     The mage has left his
  tradition, and probably changed his nature as well. These mages
  are outside the protection and support of the traditions, and
  their vision is almostimpossible to understand even for other
  mages. Most retreat into the Umbra to escape the Ascension War.
  Some mages try to find the Oracles to perfect their magick.
  Others try to find themselves. To continue, the mage must
  transcend his limited view of the world and/or himself,
  experiencing a second Awakening. This can take several centuries
  to do. Many mages prefer to remain on this level, finding
  pleasure in their power or self-knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      <span class="c5">
       7-8
      </span>
     </b>
     This is the level of the
  Oracles. They have realised that their old ideas about the
  spheres work was just another arbitrary way to look at reality.
  They are able to freely choose they way they like to see magick;
  in the same way a lesser mage can change reality by viewing it in
  an arbitrary way, an Oracle can change the way they (or anybody
  else) see magick. Thus they transcend spheric magick, being able
  to use magick in any way they want. this can take thousands of
  years. Many Oracles prefer to remain Oracles, but a few tries to
  understand the world even further.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      <span class="c5">
       9-10
      </span>
     </b>
     These levels are so high
  that maybe only the most advanced Oracles can even begin to
  fathom them.

    <p>

    <p class="c4">
     <span class="c1">
      Normality
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Mages start out as humans. But do they remain humans? In the
  beginning, the changes are mild, "just" a total change of
  world-view and other psychological changes. But as the mage
  becomes more powerful, they drift apart from humanity. After a
  while their minds are no longer quite human, and their worldviews
  are even stranger. Even the most social and amiable mage will
  become quite alien when they begin to understand reality. Think
  of the world of a mage with Time 5 and Correspondence 5! He will
  *know* and *see* that time and space doesn't exist, that
  everything exists at the same time, at the same place. And this
  is possible at Arete 5. Can a human even imagine the world of an
  Oracle, who still is much lesser than an Enlightened One?
    </p>
    <p>
     Here is my "normality rating", a kind of humanity for mages.
  Instead of showing how far the vampire had succumbed to the
  beast, it shows how alien or non human the mage has become. At
  first the mage is quite human, but as he develops he looses his
  humanity. Finally, he reaches normality 0, which means that he
  has become altogether impossible to understand for normal humans
  (and most mages). Of course it is impossible to squeeze something
  as deep as the alienness of a person into a one-dimensional
  scale, but I'm a technomancer anyway :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     A small warning: I do not intend this to be used as an actual
  trait in the game (although would be possible). This should
  really be roleplayed, but it is much easier to explain using
  rules. The best way is perhaps to just keep it in mind during the
  game. The ideas I present here are not finished, just some
  suggestions.
    </p>
    <p>
     A mage starts with a normality of 10 (normally. It could be
  changed by his background). It is decreased with 1 for every dot
  in arete. It may also be lowered when the mage encounters or does
  other normality-lowering thing like changes of his body and mind,
  exploring the deep umbra, performing actions outside of the
  ability of any human, powerful supernatural effects or suffers
  form paradox. Most mages will reach 0 long before they reach
  Arete 10.
    </p>
    <p>
     I think normality would limit the dice-pool for social
  interactions with sleepers (and other mages on higher levels). It
  may have other effects too, like the strength of quiet and the
  amount of "weirdness" around the mage. It would be interesting to
  find a "Hieararchy of Sins" for this trait.
