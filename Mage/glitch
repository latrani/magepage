        The Glitches are not truely, Digital Monitors, because they
are used as often from the Umbra as from the Digital Web, but here they
are:

Glitch Monitors:
        Glitches are small but thoroughly annoying little techno-spirts
that are often sent against the technocracy's enemies en mass.  They
embody the tendance of machines to break down, work improperly,
and generally be tempramental.  The technocracy has devotes quite a bit
of energy to taming these spirits, and controls large numbers of them.
        Tradition mages have often noticed the effects of a Glitch and
followed one through the umbra, only to be ambushed by a large number of
them hiding nearby.  The spirits have a pack mentality, and are purely
mischevious if given free reign.
        When assigned to an individual, one Glitch Monitor will follow
him closely, using his magick to disable any machine the mage tries to
use.  They also try to break things in ways that cause others harm.
        The technocracy uses Glitch Monitors to prevent important
machines from breaking down or being tampered with, though this
often causes very minor problems to arise.
        Glitch Monitors appear as two foot tall creatures of a humanoid
-insectois cross.  They are made entirely from translucent, glassy
materials and make cricket-liek sounds whenever they are excited and to
communicate.  Their arms are spindly and over-long, tipped with blade
like claws.

 MAGICK:
- Slay Machine ( *** Entropy, *** Spirit ) - This is as the Entropy 3
effect, but is done from the Umbra on machines in the physical world.
- Maintain Machine ( *** Entropy, *** Spirit ) - A reverse of Slay
Machine, a machine a Glitch Monitor watches over never shows any major
wear or breakdown.
- Meld ( *** Life, *** Spirit ) - The most dangerous ability of a Glitch
Monitor pack is that they can physically combine into a more powerful
spirit.  For each Glitch Monitor in a meld beyond the first, add 1 to
Strength.  For every two glitches, add 1 to stamina.  For every three,
a point of armor is gained ( see attacks below ).  Multi-unit glitches
can fire a dart for each glitch in the meld ( see attacks below ).
No more than ten Glitch Monitors can meld, but ten together are a
respectable force.
- Supress Healing ( *** Entropy, *** Life, ** Prime ) - A Glitch Monitor
can pour it's quintessence into making the wounds it causes aggrivated.
This costs one point of quintessence for each successful strike.
 ATTACKS:
-Claws: The bladed arms of a Glitch Monitor can cause Strength +1 Damage.
-Armor: Glitch Monitors have one point of armor.
-Darts: A Glitch can fire it's knife-like hands as projectiles, re-growing them
for the next round.  They cause two dice of damage, and two can be fired
each round.

        Alone a Glitch is an annoyance, but just as many small problems can
be one big problem, many small Glitches can be  one big disaster.
