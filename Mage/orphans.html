   Thought I'd share a few ideas for Orphans that I've come up with
  in the past:
   <h2>
    Darlita Washington
   </h2>
   Born in the worst neighborhood in her
  town's inner city slums, Darlita's future did not appear bright.
  Destiny, however, cares little for economic or social woes, and
  upon little Darlita, it smiled.
   <p>
    Darlita was born to fifteen year Shawndra Washington, the
  second child to emerge from her loins in two years. The mother
  was a high school dropout and had only known the childrens'
  fathers long enough to conceive. They shared their two-room
  apartment with Shawndra's brother and his girlfriend, the
  tenement itself literally located at the corner of the city's
  worst two streets, where drug gangs and the violence that came
  with them had set up shop. Drive by shootings, stabbings, drug
  overdoses, and every other sort of similar horror laid claim to
  the newborn child's home.
   </p>
   <p>
    But things happened. While the rest of the borough's violence
  only increased, the killings piling up day after day, Darlita's
  block changed for the better. The shootings still occurred, but
  fewer innocents were killed by stray bullets, and fewer drug
  deaths occurred. As a few more years passed, the violence itself
  began to rapidly dissipate, as if some unseen power was forcing
  it away. Some magickal sphere of peace seemed to center on
  Darlita's building, and when the little girl herself came outside
  to play on the sidewalk or to even go to the nearby playground to
  use the swingset, the danger that was part and parcel of the area
  seemed to retreat into the background. No one ever put two and
  two together. No one ever realized that this nine year old girl
  was the cause of this change.
   </p>
   <p>
    Darlita was awakened prior to her own birth, amazingly enough,
  due to the both the hand of Destiny and the trauma her mother
  endured at the loss of her sister's meaningless death by a random
  gang shooting. The little girl's mother kept little Darlita
  indoors for much of her first few years, sitting her in front of
  the television and letting her watch Disney movies to help hide
  cold reality from her. It worked.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Awakened child never knew what reality was "supposed" to
  be, so she made it up as she went along, helped by Uncle Walt's
  movies and morally beneficial characters. Darlita imagined
  herself a little mermaid, or an Arabian princess, or whatever.
  She also
    <em>
     knew
    </em>
    that peace, love and happiness were real,
  whereas danger were unwanted and had no place in the world. Had
  she been an ordinary girl, this view would have been shattered
  upon her introduction to her real surroundings, but Darlita was
  not ordinary. Instead, upon venturing forth from her apartment,
  she took her own reality with her and imposed it wherever she
  went.
   </p>
   <p>
    Today, the few blocks around little Darlita's home are
  amazingly free of crime. People are nicer there and the short
  walk to the playground is a safe one. Even the elementary school
  has become a model for student cooperation and relative harmony,
  something that has surprised and simultaneously gladdened its own
  teachers and administrators. They have no idea what brought about
  the change, but they are proud that it has happened. Darlita is a
  model student and her own teachers use her as an example of what
  their school is capable of producing.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Benny Musello
   </h2>
   Somewhere out there in the city an old cab
  still carries its fares to their destinations, wherever they may
  be. The driver has never turned down a ride and has never failed
  to get that ride to any place desired. On time. Somewhere out
  there in the city, Benny Musello still drives his cab.
   <p>
    Benny is a good natured guy in his middle years, balding and
  showing signs of a man who did not glide through life. Benny does
  not apologize for his appearance, though some fares have ignored
  his friendly stabs at conversation probably due to their upper
  crust arrogance. As hacks go, Benny is the best.
   </p>
   <p>
    Driving a cab is the only thing Benny cares to do. It is his
  purpose in life, he says. Going from point A to point B. That's
  it. And no one can do it as well as he. Even in rush hour
  traffic, on a holiday weekend, in the snow and with a major
  accident ahead, Benny can find a way to bypass it all and get to
  wherever he needs to be without a hitch. It's like magick.
   </p>
   <p>
    And there is nowhere that Benny can't find. None. It's as if
  he has some sixth sense that will lead him there regardless.
  Sometimes, Benny has even taken his ride to a place not
  requested, but in those cases the ride seems to realize that it
  was the right place to be anyway. He's never had any
  complaints.
   </p>
   <p>
    Benny is a mage, of course. Though he might be on the
  sidelines of the haughty Ascension War, it means nothing to him.
  His only concern is pleasing his customers, bringing home the
  bread, and taking care of his wife and kids. Mess with these
  things and watch out, though, 'cause strange things happen to
  those who stiff Benny Musello.
   </p>
   <p>
    The mob tried to slap some "truth" out of him once. They don't
  mess with Benny now. At all. Some strange guy playing Dracula
  once tried to do a job on Benny in the middle of the night.
  Whatever that dude saw in Benny's rear view mirror, however,
  seemed to change its mind forever, its terror plain as day. Benny
  is not a mean guy though, just an honest man lookin' out for
  himself and his family.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Richie Wallace
   </h2>
   You know his work, though you probably
  don't know his name. He has a way of sort of...being forgotten. A
  good thing for Richie, since his photos have been the sole reason
  for the arrest of a good percentage of the city's most notorious
  gangsters, cutthroats, cheats, liars and other slime. Richie just
  seems to be a lucky guy.
   <p>
    Despite his successes, Richie has never been happy. Oh, sure
  he's friendly and all, but he has never achieved the one thing he
  set out to do: become a Great Photojournalist. Win the Pulitzer,
  and all that. Problem is, though he is the best photog in the
  city -- hell! maybe in the country -- Richie is unmemorable.
  While his work is plastered daily on the front page, while juries
  vote unanimously to convict based on the damning pictures
  captured by Richie's camera and quick eye, Richie himself has
  never garnered any real notice.
   </p>
   <p>
    Richie Awakened upon finding The Camera, an old style rig that
  no right minded photographer would think of using any more. Ever
  since his discovery at the old tag sale, Richie has literally
  seen the world through a different set of eyes. He has discovered
  an uncanny ability to be at the right place at the right time and
  to get the Shot of the Century -- every time! And luckily for
  him, for whatever reason, he is able to get away from any who
  might realize what he has stumbled upon. Oddly enough, this is
  the only time he is glad that he is such a "nobody" in the eyes
  of others.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are plenty of people (and others) who would love to get
  their clenched hands around Richie's neck, but like the flash of
  The Camera, all that is left of him in their memories is a
  momentary after image and then he is gone, fading back into the
  obscurity that he cannot escape.
   </p>
   <h2>
    "Mac" Newman
   </h2>
   Business is never better than on the corner
  near the fresh grocer and the Lotto outlet. Whether its a keen
  weather prediction, some tidbits on city hall, the outcome of the
  big serial killer trial, or just some magazines and a stick of
  gum, Mac's Newsstand is your place; night or day.
   <p>
    Having survived his wife by some years now, Mac Newman has
  found a new lease on life tending his newsstand. Rain or shine,
  night or day, Mac does not disappoint, greeting his menagerie of
  diverse customers with a conspiratorial smile and a piece of
  advice from left field. His quick wit and ability to offer an
  opinion and prediction about everything from sports to city
  corruption make him a favorite in town, not to mention the
  excellent assortment of papers and titles that he carries.
   </p>
   <p>
    Mac's place has become famous for another reason: he always
  seems to have a copy of an out of print paper or magazine on
  hand, no matter how old or obscure the title is. The same goes
  for gum, cigarettes and cigars. This amazing fact has made his
  stand a mecca for the city's more interesting folk, a number of
  whom make stopping by and chatting for a while a daily routine,
  with key officials, cops, attorneys, reporters and executives
  always finding that picking up their own paper rather than having
  it brought to them is not without its rewards.
   </p>
   <p>
    Though some have surely thought that Mac was somehow involved
  in deeper plots of some kind due to his knowledge and
  connections, none have dared move against him for two reasons: he
  has too many good friends in high places and no one, not even
  those who don't trust him, want to lose the services he is able
  to provide.
   </p>
   <p>
    For Mac's part, he is just happy to give the public what they
  want. And that's exactly what he gives them....!
