  <h1>
   Epicurean Guild
  </h1>
  This Guild was formed by members of the
  Cult of Ecstasy during the renaissance in Italy, mainly as a
  parody of the serious guilds and the traditions. Over the last
  centuries the guild has dissolved several times only to be
  restarted and reorganised again, the idea of a society for
  hedonists seems to have much vitality.
  <p>
   American cultists would probably call the Epicureans
  bourgeois, but the Epicureans would just point out that there is
  no need for being poor or outside society to be truly avant
  garde, and it is much more interesting. The Guild functions a bit
  like an old boys network, where the members pledge to help each
  other to live life to the fullest. The main lodge is located in
  Marseilles, and secondary lodges can be found in many of the
  major cities of Europe. The meetings are usually held either in
  obscure restaurants or private apartments, or at secluded villas
  outside the city.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unlike the Cult of the new world, the Epicureans prefer subtle
  pleasures. Life is not lived for pleasure, life itself should
   <i>
    be
   </i>
   a pleasure, preferably with as much class and finesse
  as possible. Pleasures can always be refined to higher levels and
  the senses trained to note the most subtle details, to make even
  a sip of wine or the hint of perfume an ecstatic moment.
  </p>
  <p>
   One area the members of the Guild excel in is the appreciation
  of fine food and drink; a perfectly cooked dish served at the
  right moment with an inspiring wine is a transcendent ecstasy for
  the true gourmet. Many members are both skilled in the kitchen
  and at the table, coaxing new aromas into reality and able to
  discern the textures of taste itself.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Guild fights the Technocracy in its own way. It seeks to
  show the sleepers the beauty of the world, that through a few
  simple tricks in the kitchen an ordinary meal can become a feast
  and that love still is a force to be reckoned with. It contrasts
  the kitsch of the Technocracy with the quality and aesthetics of
  the old. Guild members have always been at home in high culture
  and intellectuals, and often are behind protests against new
  buildings, lowering of food standards or cut-backs in culture. In
  Italy they support the Slow Food movement, which tries to teach
  people to eat slowly and with relish, instead of just filling
  their stomachs with fast food without taste or style. In France
  they have ties to the wine farmers, who have fairly clear-cut
  views of how their regions should be handled. Also, somewhat
  unexpectedly, the Epicureans have some support from a group of
  vampires, who seem to share their interest in the aesthetic side
  of life.
