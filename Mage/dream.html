     "From my experience I cannot doubt that man, when lost to the
    terrestrial consciousness, is indeed sojourning in another and
    uncorporeal life of far different nature from the life we know,
    and of which only the slightest and most indistinct memories
    linger after waking."
     <h5>
      Lovecraft, "Beyond the Wall of Sleep"
     </h5>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     The Dreamers are a minor tradition, closely tied to the Cult
  of Ecstasy, Dreamspeakers and certain Orphans, which deals with
  the magick of dreaming and the dreamrealms. Other mages do this
  too, but the Dreamers specialise completely in this area. In
  fact, they have forsaken practically all of their power over the
  waking world for the ability to control the Chimerae.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Dreamers have realised that dreams are as real as the
  waking world, if not more real. Outside consensus reality is a
  sea of changing dreams which give it colour and meaning. New
  ideas and concepts are created in dreams, and trickle down into
  reality where they become real. By changing the dreams of people
  the real world can be changed. But many Dreamers have no interest
  in the grey and dreary waking world, preferring to create
  magnificent realms in the kingdom of sleep instead. It is so much
  easier to work magick in the free and loose reality of the dreams
  or the Chimerae that many Dreamers don't find it worthwhile to
  try to influence waking reality.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Dreamers are not a true sub-tradition of the Cult of
  Ecstasy. While they share much of the same philosophy and
  anarchistic attitude to magick, they have diverged somewhat.
  While the Cult tries to awaken the sleepers to the joys of the
  world and make them conscious of the possibilities beyond, the
  Dreamers try to make sleepers see the power of dreams and
  fantasy. Another group which has influenced them a lot is the
  Dreamspeakers. The shamans of ancient times knew the power of
  dreams, and often used them. However, the strongest difference
  between the Dreamers and the two traditions are the Orphans among
  them. Sometimes sleepers spontaneously awaken in their dreams and
  find that their ability to shape them extends much further than
  anybody has ever told them. These Orphan Dreamers form a vital
  and heterogeneous group among the Dreamers. And there is so
  little difference between the Orphans and the "Tradition"
  Dreamers that its virtually unimportant.
    </p>
    <p>
     While the origins of the Dreamers are manifold, their goals
  and methods are even more numerous. Some Dreamers are content to
  create beautiful realms in their own realms or sight-see in other
  peoples dreams. Others work to change sleeper society and support
  the Traditions by manipulating the dreams of people. But others
  have no compunctions about manipulating or even killing people in
  their dreams. And a few use their magick to gain power in the
  Chimerae and seek to become Dream Lords themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dream magick is both far more powerful and far inferior to
  normal magick. It is usually quite limited to work only within
  the dreams, making it rather hard to use in the waking world. On
  the other hand, inside the dreamrealms it is close to
  omnipotence. Dreams can be changed, be given reality, destroyed,
  linked and warped. A Dreamer can perform great magickal feats
  without fear of paradox, limited only by his own imagination.
  Powerful Dreamers can even cross the border between Dream and
  Reality, using their powers to affect the waking world from
  beyond the wall of sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dreamers are seldom interested in the waking world, since it
  is such a pale and dreary place compared to the reality of
  dreams. All Dreamers are tempted to stay as long as possible
  among the dreams and ignore the demands of waking life. Many use
  drugs to extend their sleep (note that they shun sleeping-pills,
  since they inhibit dreaming), and most Dreamers seem fairly
  lethargic in their daily life. Appearances can be deceiving. Many
  Dreamers have low- paying day jobs to keep themselves alive, and
  spend all free time dreaming.

      Dreams and Dreaming

    <blockquote>
     Apropos of sleep, that sinister adventure of all our nights, we
    may say that men go to bed daily with an audacity that would be
    incomprehensible if we did not know that it is the result of
    ignorance of the danger.
     <h5>
      Baudelaire
     </h5>
    </blockquote>
    Dreams are transitory. This is one of the axioms of
  dreaming. A normal person will dream several independent dreams
  every night, often forgetting them even before awaking. A dream
  which is forgotten will quickly begin to dissolve. Dreams which
  are remembered are given some permanence, but the waking mind
  will order it and rationalise it into a linear patter,
  essentially calcifying it to a memory. However, a dreamer can
  keep a dream alive for some time, or try to give it some
  independent existence.
    <p>
     The most important thing for a dreamed dream is it's dreamer.
  The dreamer is its creator, ruler and upholder, and the dream
  only exists in his mind. The dreamer (or rather his subconscious)
  is almost all-powerful in the dream, being able to dictate its
  course and its laws. Most people are so dream-illiterate that
  they cannot influence their own dreams, and the dreams become
  images created from their subconscious. This means that the
  realities they create are formed by their own fears, expectations
  and desires, often making them highly individual. The reality is
  quite often not that far from static reality, although
  significant changes in the axioms often occur (like the ability
  to fly or breather underwater). A Dreamer can easily get paradox
  by trying to do work magick effects in sleeper dreams if they are
  not allowed by the current paradigm. It is essential for a good
  dreamer to quickly be able to understand the often strange laws
  inside a dream to be able to use magick.
    </p>
    <p>
     The use of magick in the realm of dreams is not entirely
  straightforward, since its realities are so varied. A mage is
  nearly omnipotent in his own dreams, since he can decide the laws
  of reality (and thus give it a rating of (say) 5 in Forces at a
  whim). All magick inside his own dreams is coincidental as long
  as it doesn't involve anything from the outside. As mentioned
  above, inside other peoples dreams the mage is limited to what is
  currently allowed, although clever mages usually can manipulate
  the dreamer to dream reality into the desired form. Magick is
  generally needed to create changes in other people's dreams. To
  magickally influence across the barrier to the waking world or
  into other dreams, the mage must be careful to create
  coincidences. To kill somebody in his sleep is entirely possible
  as long as its done coincidentally (e.g.. the mage suffocates the
  person under a mountain of dust, and in real world he is
  suffocated by a pillow or his own tongue). Reality in the free
  dreams is usually rather stable, although generally free, and in
  the Chimerae most magick is coincidental, as long as no Dream
  Lord vetoes it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dreams doesn't contain much Quintessence, and dreamed
  Quintessence isn't real. Real Quintessence is quite powerful in
  the dream-world, since it can make dreams more real, but is not
  necessary to create a dream. For that imagination is enough. The
  person who dreams a dream sustains it by being aware of it, and
  if he lapses it will fade. However, discarded dreams have their
  uses. Some are remembered and will generally calcify. Others are
  collected by Dreamers and sustained by Quintessence. If enough
  Quintessence is fed into the dream it will become a permanent
  realm in itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, the great majority of surviving dreams drift off into
  the Deep Umbra where they join the aptly named Chimerae, the
  dream- lands. The dreams of the Chimerae are stable for some
  unknown reason. Some attribute this to the existence of a
  powerful being, a true Dream Lord, who is aware of them all and
  thus keep them in existence. The dreams in the Chimerae link up
  together into a complex agglomeration filled amazing denizens and
  fanciful places. They all seem to link up a bit according to
  content, creating large areas of roughly similar content (like
  great cities, archetypal forests, infinite oceans and the
  labyrinthine dungeons where the nightmares live).
    </p>
    <p>
     The inhabitants of the Chimerae range from the beings and
  persons of peoples dreams over Dreamers (both Awakened and
  Asleep) to the Dream Lords, as they call themselves. These
  powerful mages or beings all seek to control at least their part
  of the Chimerae. Some, like the Warlord of Khem, seek to gain
  supremacy over the entire Chimerae. Their fights are legendary,
  wrecking dreams and ripping apart the loose reality of the
  Chimerae. Usually they have to restrain themselves to avoid
  creating too much damage, or risk incurring the wrath of the
  hypothetical True Dreamlord. Most such Dreamlords were originally
  powerful Dreamers, and often seek to snare unwary Dreamers to
  suit their own purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finding the way among the dreams is very tricky. Just
  orienting inside a single dream can be rather complex, as the
  landscape constantly shifts and changes according to the whims of
  the dreamer. Correspondence is very popular among Dreamers not
  only to find their ways, but also to move to their destinations.
  Another way to reach a dream is to travel into the Chimerae and
  try to find a way into the destination dream. This requires much
  intuition, and the profession of being a dreamguide is popular
  among many inhabitants.
    </p>
    <p>
     To dream is dangerous, although only the Dreamers understand
  it truly. While a normal dream at most can frighten a person
  awake or make them feel uncomfortable for the rest of the day, a
  magickal dream can kill. In a normal dream the dreamer cannot be
  killed, he will just regenerate and continue dreaming (unless he
  is sufficiently scared about death, which will awaken him with
  fright). This is often true for other inhabitants of his dream
  too, which is quite safe. A mage whose dream-self is killed in a
  sleeper dream is usually thrown back into his own dreams with
  little real damage, and often he can return immediately. But
  weapons and objects enchanted a la
     <a href="Mage/dream.html#empower">
      Empower Dream
     </a>
     can do "aggravated dream damage"; while they
  still cannot hurt the person in the waking world, they can hurt
  even the dreamer of a dream and give him real pain (although most
  sleepers are so incompetent dreamers that the pain is not felt as
  strongly as usual). If a dreamer is "killed" with empowered
  weapons he will start awake, briefly filled with pain and fear.
  Usually some phantom pains persist for some time (coincidentally
  explained by muscle stretchings or minor cramps).
    </p>
    <p>
     However, a mage can also use magick in the dream to reach out
  an actually kill a person in real life. This is not completely
  easy to do coincidental, but creative mages have found ways to
  make people coincidentally die in their sleep (the Euthanatos
  have discovered that an amazing number of people have heart
  problems, and there are persistent rumours of a sect of
  Euthanatos causing sudden baby death). A special danger to
  Dreamers are sleeping mages, who can use their magick against
  them in their dreams, and even accidentally kill them. Meeting
  another mage in his own dreams is very dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another danger is the strange creatures which live in the
  dreams. Some have their own powers, and can be quite dangerous.
  Many of these beings originate in the Chimerae but range into the
  dreams of sleeping people. Most are of course harmless, like the
  rotund Gluttony who appears wherever it can find dreamed food and
  voraciously devour it. Others are more insidious, like the mind-
  controlling Cuckoo, which plants "eggs" into the dreams of
  people, forcing them to dream its young into existence until they
  can hatch into new dreams. Even worse are the mental parasites
  which seek out dreamers, imprison their dream-selves and possess
  their bodies to experience the pleasures of the physical
  world.

    <h2>
     Spheres and magick
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
     "We may guess that in dreams life, matter and vitality, as the
    earth knows such things, are not necessarily constant; and that
    time and space do not exist as our waking selves comprehend
    them."
     <h5>
      Lovecraft, "Beyond the Wall of Sleep"
     </h5>
    </blockquote>
    The Dreamers concentrate on Mind. Mind is the sphere
  which allows a Dreamer to change dreams in general, especially it
  allows the Dreamers to control their own dreams, and also
  influence the minds of other sleeping people. This ability is
  more powerful than most non-Dreamers realise, since it allows
  clever Dreamers to control the dreams of other people.
    <p>
     To supplement this, many Dreamers also study Prime. Since
  Prime essentially is the sphere of "realness", it can be quite
  useful in the dream-realms. An object in a dream which is infused
  with prime gains much power, and can start to influence the
  waking world.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many dreamers also study Spirit with great interest, to be
  able to cross between different realms and into the waking world.
  Spirit is mainly used to go "up" or "down" among the realms,
  while Correspondence is used to move between dreams of the same
  type or in the Chimerae. Spirit also enables them to turn dreams
  into "real" realms and summon dreambeings. Correspondence is
  naturally very useful to get around and find one's way.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Pattern Spheres are very useful for Dreamers, mainly
  because they are so free in the dreaming. To create a pattern in
  a dream, no Prime is required (if it is used, the resulting
  pattern will become empowered and superior to normal objects and
  beings in a dream). This naturally makes it much easier for
  Dreamers to work complex patternmagicks and to change the worlds
  around them. Since many are so used to the ease of this, they
  find magick in the waking world a nasty chore.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Foci
    </h2>
    <b>
     Sleep:
    </b>
    all spheres. The Dreamers magick works
  by manipulating "the stuff dreams are made of", and this
  naturally requires them to be asleep to be able to work their
  magick. Some Dreamers experiment with other altered states of
  consciousness, mainly drug intoxication.
    <p>
     This is also one of the reasons Orphans are accepted into the
  group. Although the Dreamer Orphans do not require sleep to do
  their magick, their interest is usually solely directed towards
  dream- magick, which make them use sleep too. Even the more
  advanced mages who no longer requires sleep to work their magick
  use it, since they must enter the dreaming somehow.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Philosophy
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
     "Sometimes I believe that this less material life is our truer
    life, and that our vain presence on the terraqueous globe is
    itself the secondary or merely a virtual phenomenon."
     <h5>
      Lovecraft, "Beyond the Walls of Sleep"
     </h5>
    </blockquote>
    "You say dreams are just illusions. You are right.
  They are "just" illusions, but illusions are what reality is
  built of. Open your eyes, and see how the waking world is just a
  pale reflection of the dreaming. It contains all secrets, all
  possibilities and all freedom that there have ever been, are or
  will be. It is the dreams of humanity which shape reality, not
  their thoughts."
    <h2>
     Organisation
    </h2>
    The Dreamers are even less organised than
  the Cult of Ecstasy. Many are solitary mages, working alone and
  belonging to no chantry. Most Dreamers form loose cliques or
  associations, often congregating in some collective dreams and
  working together.
    <h2>
     Chantry
    </h2>
    No central chantry exists. However, there are
  several dreamed chantries, mainly in the Chimerae. Most famous is
  the alabaster- walled city of Thran, placed where the singing
  river Oukranos flows into the Cerenerian Sea. To enter the city a
  Dreamer must tell three dreams beyond belief to the red-robed
  sentries who guard its hundred gates. The city itself is
  fabulous, with golden spires and towers reaching into the clouds
  and the strange tangles of mists above, great wharves of marble
  with ornate galleons of fragrant cedar and calamander, undulating
  streets filled with music and light and temples to unknown gods.
  The city is a centrum of trade and magick for a good part of the
  Chimerae, but staunchly neutral in the wars between the
  Dreamlords. Somehow it has retained its independence.
    <h2>
     Meetings
    </h2>
    There are no central meetings or any holy times
  for the Dreamers. However, sometimes a Dreamer or a group of
  Dreamers call for a gathering to discuss matters of grave
  importance, like imminent Dream Warps, intrusions from the Umbra
  into the dreamlands or the activities of the Dream Lords. These
  meetings are held in specially crafted dreams, usually
  masterpieces of dreamweaving and magick although etiquette does
  not allow any Dreamer to hold dominion over the dream the meeting
  takes place in. In the Chimerae the Dream Lords hold court, and
  often gather their subjects to show their adoration and gratitude
  to the being which they can thank for their existence.

     </a>
    </h3>
    By
  infusing an object, a being or a place in a dream with
  quintessence, it is given independent existence. This will
  empower it greatly, and give it some permanence. Even if the
  dream which contains it dissolves, the object will often survive
  by becoming a permanent part of the subconscious of the dreamer.
    <h3>
     Keep the Dream Alive (Mind 2 Prime 2)
    </h3>
    This rote gives the
  Dreamer power to temporarily sustain a dream even after the
  dreamer has ended dreaming it, preventing it from dissolving or
  calcifying. It will continue to exist as long as the mage feeds
  it quintessence (a quite heavy task for greater dreams). The
  dream will continue as it would, except that the original dreamer
  is now absent (and thus the rules will remain the same). If the
  dream is sustained enough it will become completely independent
  and permanent. More powerful dreamers collect beautiful dreams
  from people and then store them, or leave them as nice surprises
  for sleepers.
    <h3>
     Thread of Ariadne (Correspondence 2 Spirit 1 Mind 1)
    </h3>
    One
  problem most Dreamers have is to find their way through the
  shifting Chimerae and other dreams. By concentrating on the
  destination, the mage can find a path leading to it. This path is
  by no means the easiest or safest, just the shortest possible
  path.
    <h3>
     Summon Dream-Stead (Spirit 2)
    </h3>
    To travel in the dreaming
  many mages employ the services of the Dream-Stead, beings which
  will happily work for the mage in exchange for Quintessence. They
  can look like anything, ranging from horses to fantastic
  creatures only possible in a dream. They are often quite well
  oriented in the dreaming, and know many secret pathways and odd
  corners. Some are even intelligent enough to hold a conversation.
  Over time many become loyal to their mages, and become constant
  companions.
    <h3>
     Replay Dream (Mind 2 Time 2)
    </h3>
    By reaching back into time
  and into the subconscious of a sleeper, a Dreamer can make him
  remember a forgotten dream and begin to dream it again. This is
  seldom entirely perfect, since it often decay when not actively
  dreamed, but is sometimes the only way to restore a destroyed
  dream. Some dreamers have whole libraries of memories which they
  can whip up and create new dreams of.
    <h3>
     Create Dream (Mind 3)
    </h3>
    Any Dreamer can control his own
  dreams, but actually creating dreams from scratch requires much
  skill. The Dreamer first empties his mind of other images, and
  then focuses it on creating a dream. Creating a full-scale dream
  takes a lot of time and concentration, but is usually worth it.
  Some mages channel Quintessence into it to make it permanent.
    <h3>
     Bridge the Rift (Correspondence 3)
    </h3>
    To teleport into the
  dreams of other people is a common trick. Usually the mage
  concentrates briefly on the person he want to meet, and if that
  person is dreaming the mage will appear in his dream. This is
  usually coincidental, as long as the mage starts from his own
  dream.
    <h3>
     Walking forth by day (Spirit 3)
    </h3>
    It is possible for a
  dreamer to cross over from the dream realms into the waking world
  by breaking through the gauntlet of the realms into reality. The
  mage appears physically in the world, and now has to follow its
  laws. At the same time his real body lies asleep somewhere, and
  cannot awake until the dreamer returns into its dreams. However,
  there is a risk that Paradox can sever the link between the
  dreamer and his body in this state, and then the body will
  awaken. Apparently the body is possessed by a paradox being with
  exactly the same abilities and powers as the mage, bent on making
  sure its the only one. More than one ambitious Dreamer has fallen
  victim to himself in this fashion.
    <h3>
     Blur the Barrier (Mind 3 Spirit 3 Entropy 2)
    </h3>
    This rote is
  a favourite among the more dynamic Dreamers, who are not far from
  Marauders themselves. They reach into the dreams of a person or a
  place and then blur the line between dream and reality. Things,
  situations and people from the dreams will appear coincidentally
  in the lives of the victims, strange events and odd
  hallucinations will follow them. Life becomes a slightly surreal
  affair, where nothing is certain and everything is possible.
    <h3>
     Disrupt Dream (Mind 4)
    </h3>
    To cause plain chaos and disorder
  in a dream is quite easy for a true Dreamer (many just do it for
  fun with the dreams of unsuspecting sleepers), but to actually
  destroy a dream is hard. The mage has to dissolve the connection
  between the dreamer and the dream, not only on a conscious level
  but also from his subconscious, and finally erase the dream
  itself. On the whole it is a dangerous operation, which is bound
  to make other inhabitants of the dream- realms vary of the mage.
    <h3>
     Summon Person (Correspondence 4)
    </h3>
    Sometimes Dreamers need
  to get hold of people outside their own dreams. One way is to
  literally teleport them into the dream of the Dreamer from their
  own. This can be quite an advantage, as they no longer reside in
  a dream of their choosing, and the mage is able to run the show
  instead.
    <h3>
     Steal Dream (Mind 4)
    </h3>
    This rote allows a Dreamer to try to
  sever the link between the person dreaming a dream and the dream
  itself. If it succeeds the dream will become free, hopefully
  without damage.
    <p>
     [The number of successes denote the damage the dream took in
  the process. One success means that the dream was heavily
  damaged, with major sections missing and many things changed.
  With two successes the dream only took some medium damage,
  loosing some minor locations and objects. Three successes ensure
  only small damage and minor changes, and four and more successes
  will generally leave it almost completely intact.]
    </p>
    <h3>
     Dream Dominion (Mind 4)
    </h3>
    Not only is it possible for a
  mage to sever the link between a dreamer and his dream, he can
  claim dominion over a free dream. To do this he must extend his
  mind into the dream and encompass it, essentially learn to dream
  it. The mage must understand the dream well, and at least have
  seen most of it. This way Dreamers collect interesting or
  beautiful dreams from people when they awaken and build and
  improve on their own dreams. Less ethical dreamers wrest control
  of dreams from their owners and take them. This is also the way
  the Dreamlords try to gain supremacy over the Chimerae, by
  constantly subtly infiltrating the dreams of each other and then
  suddenly striking, grabbing as many dreams as possible.
    <h3>
     Dream Knowledge (Mind 4)
    </h3>
    In dreams you are often able to
  do things you are unable to do in the waking world, or have new
  skills. Dreamers are able to actually give themselves (or others)
  new abilities, at least inside their own dreams and often inside
  other dreams too. They can also gain knowledge about things they
  should not have any knowledge about, like what other people are
  planning or what have happened to them. However, this will work
  only in their own dreams or in dreams which allow it (usually
  Sleeper dreams).
    <p>
     [Each success will give the Dreamer one dreamed dot in a
  ability. This dream-skill is only applicable inside the dream,
  and cannot work with things from the outside (have you too woken
  up with a feeling you had just managed to solve a hard problem,
  and the solution turns out to be just nonsense?) ]
    </p>
    <h3>
     Open the Ivory Gates (Spirit 4 Mind 3)
    </h3>
    Most Dreamers are
  solitary and prefer to contact other mages in their dreams, but
  sometimes they have to bring them in bodily into their dreams.
  Adept dreamers are able to open gates into their dreams, or other
  dreams. They can also open portals into the Chimerae by their own
  choosing, not having to depend on the whims of the dreams
  themselves.
    <h3>
     Link Dreams (Correspondence 4 Mind 3)
    </h3>
    The ability to link
  together dreams by portals or smooth transitions is an important
  skill for any budding Dream Lord. It requires that the mage moves
  them together and find a point or place where they fit together
  somehow (like having two doors connect or different sides of a
  lake). When the dreams merge, the results can sometimes become
  rather unpredictable. Another problem is of course that the
  dreamers of the different dreams now suddenly share the same
  dream, which can lead to conflicts.
    <h3>
     Dream Barrier (Mind 4 Spirit 4)
    </h3>
    Many Dreamers are quite
  paranoid about intruders into their dreams, and seek to both hide
  them from other dreamers and to raise barriers against them. By
  using Mind the dream can be shaped to reject intruders, and by
  using Spirit the Dreamer can prevent the opening of portals from
  the Chimerae.
    <p>
     [ Each success will remove one success from any attempt to get
  into the dream, or even detect its existence. An intruder inside
  the dream will not be hindered, but the dreamer will be instantly
  alerted by the breach. ]
    </p>
    <h3>
     Dreams into Reality (Spirit 4 Prime 3 Mind 3)
    </h3>
    A dream can
  be turned into a real realm by weaving it into the spiritual
  fabric of the Umbra and feeding it quintessence, just like in the
  creation of a normal horizon realm. This requires that the
  dreamer of the dream cooperates or that the dream is free. The
  resulting reality has axioms determined by the dream, but also
  frequently quirks and odd properties not readily apparent, based
  on the quirks of the original dreamer. Most such realms have a
  distinct resonance.
    <h3>
     Imprison Dream-Body (Mind 5)
    </h3>
    The Dream Masters can sever
  the link between a dreamer and his body. As long as he doesn't
  find his way back, he will not be able to awaken in any way, and
  if he is killed in the dreams he will die (the body will remain
  alive but in coma). This is used by unscrupulous Dreamers and
  other beings to imprison sleepers in the Chimerae, often in a
  dream controlled by the mage. Since most sleepers are rather
  helpless in the dreamworlds, they are easy prey for this.
    <h3>
     Break the Chains of Wakefulness (Mind 5)
    </h3>
    To actually
  leave one's body completely behind and permanently take up
  residence in the dreaming is a dream most Dreamers share. While
  some Dreamers accidentally do this as their bodies are killed
  during sleep or taken over by other beings, they find they
  quickly loose power and begin to fade away along with their
  dreams. The only way to survive is to have some very powerful
  Dreamer dream them constantly into existence. The Dream Lords are
  naturally only too happy to help them out, in exchange for
  eternal service. The Dream Masters who actually leave their
  bodies behind are however independent, and can act freely. This
  naturally makes many Dream Lords irritated, and they sometimes
  test new arrivals by sending their nightmares against them.
