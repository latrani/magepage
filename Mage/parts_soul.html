   THE CONSTITUENT PARTS OF IDENTITY:
  </h1>
  <h2>
   A study of individual existence utilizing classical Egyptian
  terminology
  </h2>
  <h3>
   By Aurelius Verdigris
  </h3>
  <h2>
   REN: Conceptual Aspect (True Name)
  </h2>
  One's True Name or
  conceptual existence, without which the no aspect of the
  individual could ever exist. This aspect is only affected by the
  most powerful magicks of both the Mind and Spirit and is
  potentially impossible to destroy in its entirety, change being
  the more likely result of even the most awesome assaults, though
  some suggest that even this is an impossibility. The Ren only
  exists in the Astral Plane, or High Umbra. It should be noted
  that if a mage "visits" the Astral Plane, for all intents and
  purposes the Ren is the mage's astral body. The Silver Cord that
  is often mentioned as being attached to one's astral body is
  actually attached to one's Ba. This is an important distinction
  and should be noted.
  <h2>
   SEKHEM: Realized Aspect (Raw Quintessence)
  </h2>
  Essential
  Quintessence that is necessary for an individual to exist as
  anything more substantial than mere concept. The Sekhem is only
  directly affected by a mage's Prime magicks and can be said to
  exist in every place/umbrae/etc. where an individual manifests
  some aspect aside from the Ren. A mage's Quintessence reserves
  used to make working magick easier is NOT Sekhem, as it is not
  essential and can be fully depleted without any harm to the
  mage's existence. The same can be said of a vampire's vitae as
  well as the highly specialized Gnosis, Glamour, Pathos and Power
  of other supernatural entities. (Note: this use of Sekhem is
  hierarchically different from that mentioned in the World of
  Darkness: Mummy book. The Sekhem mentioned there is actually Free
  Quintessence, akin to vampiric vitae, etc.)
  <h2>
   KHU: Quintessential Aspect (Avatar)
  </h2>
  One's Avatar, or
  eternal soul. This is the most fundamental aspect of willful
  existence and is the essential True Identity of an individual,
  the spark of existential being, if you will. Only the most
  powerful Spirit magicks can directly affect this aspect of one's
  make-up. This aspect exists simultaneously in all umbrae. Most
  humans' Khus can be called "sleeping," being essentially inactive
  and static. Those Khu which have "awakened," however, are quite
  active and are capable of dynamically altering local reality.
  Despite the close relationship between a mage's Khu and his Ba,
  however, it is the Fae who best understand the Khu, as they see
  it as their true Kithain identity, rather than a separate entity
  in and of itself. In addtion, the Khu of a vampire has
  essentially been corrupted during the Embrace by a parasitic
  contagion, the resulting mutant Avatar being called the Beast,
  while a Garou is born with a unique "werewolf Khu" which sets him
  or her apart from ordinary humans from birth. As a final note,
  during vampiric Diablerie it is the victim's Khu which must be
  "consumed" by the Diabolist's Khu for the act to be considered
  complete, the very act being essentially a struggle between the
  two for dominance. Should such consumption fail, the Diablerie
  will be incomplete, but ONLY in the sense that the victim's
  Avatar will remain free and potentially be able to be
  reincarnated at asome future date. All other spoils of the
  Diablerie will still be effected (decrease in generation, stolen
  memories, etc.).
  <h2>
   AB: Quintessential Nature (Essence)
  </h2>
  The essential
  "personality" of one's Khu. This is one's eternal, spiritual
  nature or moral "heart," something that can rarely be changed
  without resorting to the most powerful vulgar Spirit magicks. The
  Ab is not a separate aspect of one's identity per se, but is an
  aspect of one's Khu. While the Awakened posit five distinct
  possible Essences, it should be noted that this accounting may be
  overly simplified and could potentially be further broken down
  into the multitude of Fae Kiths, Vampiric Clans, a Garou Essence,
  etc. Such detail, however, could continue forever and is
  unnecessary for our purposes, though not without merit. Suffice
  to say that the Ab is merely a convenient means of archetyping
  the Khu for sake of discussion. The mages' classification
  includes the Questing, the Dynamic, the Pattern, the Primordial
  and the Infinite, these five being the broadest division still
  providing utility of study.
  <h2>
   BA: Psychic "Survival" Aspect (Psyche)
  </h2>
  The mind. One's
  emotional and intellecual identity, or eidolic psyche. For most
  purposes, the Ba is thought of as the true "I," the real seat of
  identity, though this is an insufficient correspondence for our
  more exacting purposes. All too often, however, the arrogant Ba
  fools itself into believing that it is the True Identity,
  ignoring more quintessential aspects of existence. The truth is
  that on a cosmic scale the Ba is merely a tool (technomancers
  liken the Ba to a computer's operating system) used by the Khu to
  allow it interaction with its environment (for the Khu is too
  abstract to do so itself), driven primarily by the will to
  survive. The Ba may be affected by Mind magicks, very powerful
  Entropy magicks, or similar psychic numina. The Ba can be said to
  exist in whatever plane of reality it wills itself to exist in,
  though for most humans this means the physical world only, or
  sometimes the Periphery. As a final note, the Ba can only exist
  in one place at one time, it being too limited by its need for
  stimuli to effectively operate simultaneously in numerous
  locations.
  <h2>
   KHAIBIT: Psychic "Extinction" Aspect (Shadow)
  </h2>
  The
  flip-side of one's Ba, the Khaibit is that aspect of the mind
  which seeks its own destruction, inexorably drawn to extinction
  (again, in technomantic jargon they might liken this to the bugs
  in the operating system). Like its counterpart, the shadow psyche
  may be affected by Mind magicks and mental numina. Wherever the
  Ba goes, so goes the Khaibit. Most individuals deny the existence
  of their Khaibit and so cannot find it of their own volition.
  This is a very important aspect of psychic existence, however,
  and should be recognized as such even if it cannot be easily
  identified. The Khaibit is like the little devil on one's
  shoulder, while the Ba is the proverbial angel, though this is an
  extreme and dangrous simplification.
  <h2>
   KA: Spiritual Aspect (Ephemeral Form)
  </h2>
  The "body" one
  possesses in the Living or Middle Umbra, affected by Spirit and
  Prime magicks. This aspect is created as needed and like the Khat
  and S”hu below, is not a necessary aspect of existence.
  Some mages and scholars argue that the Ka is formed from the very
  Khat, which is somehow transformed from physical "matter" to
  spiritual "matter." For purposes of this study, however, the Ka
  and Khat are completely separate and while the Khat may
  technically cease to exist when one "steps sideways," this does
  not mean that it becomes the Ka.
  <h2>
   KHAT: Physical Aspect (Material Body)
  </h2>
  One's physical,
  earthly body of flesh and blood. Directly affected by Life,
  Matter, Prime and Entropy magicks. The Khat can only exist in the
  material world, though a "new" Khat can be created for physical
  existence in other material realms beyond Gaia, and these new
  bodies can exist simultaneously without ill effect.
  <h2>
   S™HU [SOEHU]: Entropic Aspect (Corpus)
  </h2>
  The Low
  Umbral equivalent of the Khat. This "death flesh" is affected
  directly by Spirit magicks, as well as Entropy and Prime.
