Background: Apprentice to an as yet unnamed Verbena, Jinx (currently 
lacking his true human name) was transformed into a cat shortly after 
his Mentors change into a Marauder.  His mentor wanting an 
intelligent familiar without all the hassle of summoning spirits 
turned the young Mage into a cat.  Paradox caught up with the 
Marauder and he fell deeper into quiet, leaving his young apprentice 
confused and furry.  Jinx seeking to transform himself back began to 
search for the knowledge to do so, but who would want to teach a cat?
Roleplaying Notes:  Think of all those intelligent TV animals (Lassie 
,Skippy, Flipper) and you just about got it right.  You don't need to 
talk when just a few movements and actions and a well placed 
suggestion will do the job, and in fact talking (in peoples heads) is 
a lot less fun.  You haven't quite got the hang of this feline thing yet.
Image:  A jet black cat with intelligent eyes, identical to any other 
black cat and not particularly remarkable (Arcane).
