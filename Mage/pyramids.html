   The City of Pyramids
  </h1>
  <i>

  <p>
   There is very little fixed geography in the umbra; realms
  shift their positions and appearances depending on the
  expectations of people, a path that previously led to the
  pleasant fields of Dao may suddenly lead to the City of Seven
  Iniquities. But a few landmarks are stable, some fixed by human
  belief like the circles of Hell, others kept stable by secret
  metaphysical relationships in the Umbra. One such landmark is the
  City of Pyramids.
  </p>
  <p>
   The City is located on the edge of the Abyss, around the
  shores of a dark river that falls over the edge into a silent
  waterfall. Just as the name implies the city is dominated by
  numerous pyramids and necropoli amid the labyrinths of bone-white
  buildings. The sky is black as the abyss. Cold winds smelling of
  ice and silence sweep in from the nothingness outside and make
  the ashen sand in the streets creep around corners like a living
  creature.
  </p>
  <p>
   The City of Pyramids is known among the Adepts as the final
  waystation before the great emptiness. It is the last stop on the
  Path of Shin before it enters Daath. All mages must sooner or
  later undergo this journey in some form to reach Ascension - or
  be annihilated by Oblivion. The souls of those mages who choose
  to remain in the world or do not dare to cross the Abyss will
  slowly sicken and warp under the weight of the Ego, and they will
  loose the ability to see the true path before them.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unlike what one might think the City is not empty, it just
  feels abandoned. Inside the austere buildings and labyrinths
  presences watch, and sometimes unusual footsteps can be seen in
  the drifting sand. From the Abyss some Qlippoth, the empty husks
  left over from creation, have entered the city and hidden in the
  nethermost chambers and most inaccessible tombs, chattering and
  gnawing on each other.
  </p>
  <p>
   But the most dangerous inhabitants of all are the Failed Ones.
  They were once mages who boldly tried to cross the Abyss, but
  turned back in fear or did not even dare to leave the City.
  Unable to return to the world they remain among the pyramids,
  growing ever more bitter and incomplete. Some of them have
  remained here for millennia, becoming unhuman and dangerous.
  Travellers must beware of the shadows that stalk them, or they
  will join the piles of gnawed bones and skulls beneath the
  Pyramid of the Four Princes.
