    The global financial markets. Tokyo, Hong Kong, London, New York,
  Chicago. These are considered the center of the world's flow of
  money. But many forget the importance of San Francisco's
  Embarcadero district, and the growing strength of the Financial
  District in Oakland. In the case of a disaster, all the worlds
  financial market functions can be transferred almost seamlessly
  to San Francisco and environs, without much mre than a 12 hour
  delay. And at the heart of this lies a small, little known
  company by the name of Michaels, Janniver, and Bryce.
    <h2>
     History
    </h2>
    <p>
     Michaels, Janniver, and Bryce was actually formed in Boston,
  during the early 1800s. They were responsible for chartering and
  insuring many of the companies that engaged in trade with the
  West. Soon, instead of direct insurance, they were underwriting
  the insurance companies themselves, and ended up in a position to
  control what shipments were insured against attakc, and therefore
  what shipments were trusted by companies. This gave them an early
  lock on the entire market of the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
     In 1840, after hearing small rumors of gold strikes in the
  Sierra Nevada mountains, the entire company up and moved its
  headquarters to the West Coast. Their competitors were glad for
  this, though none understood their motivation.
    </p>
    <p>
     THey began investing heavilly in prospecting and mining
  claims, supporting most of the ventures that went into the
  Sierras. Once gold was finally found in large quantities, the
  rush began.
    </p>
    <p>
     The reasons behind this masterstroke impressed the higher
  positions within the Syndicate. Here was the golden opportunity
  (pardon the pun) to turn the immense quintessence contained
  within gold and convert it into the more fluid Tass of money.
  This also gave them the strength necessary to begin massively
  undermining the gold standard for currency, untethering money
  from any sort of tangible, physical existence.
    </p>
    <p>
     These assets were then channelled into underwritnig shipping
  and industrial ventures in the area, redistributing the massive
  Quint from the Sierras into the operations in the Bay Area.
    </p>
    <p>
     Through it all, MJ&amp;B has remained a quiet partner in many
  of the investment firms and banks of the Bay Area of California.
  They try to keep their name out of the papers and off the lips of
  the public, though their lawyers are known on sight by most of
  the investors, bankers, and corporate lawyers in the region.
    </p>
    <p>
     Currently, they are one of the major "behind the scenes"
  players in the increasing frenzy for companies of all sizes to
  merge into more powerful, yet more easilly controlled
  conglomerates. It has been a vehicle to et many Syndicate plants
  into the upper management of some previously resistant
  companies.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Location
    </h2>
    <p>
     The main offices of MJ&amp;B are on the 34th and 35th floors
  of one of the taller buildings along the Embarcadero, a stretch
  of real-estate along the north end of Mission Blvd. Not on the
  top floor, nor near the bottom, they have a very low profile for
  a firm so influential in the San Francisco monetary markets.
    </p>
    <p>
     The offices themselves are done in the typical pattern for the
  corporate-financial elite, somewhat large spaces with tropical
  plants in the corners, thick russet or burgundy carpet, mahogany
  desks, with a very crisp, businesslike feel. The secretaries are
  the most the average person sees, and their demeanor tends to be
  as crisp and businesslike as their environment. ANd normally
  includes a curt denial of a request to see anyone else in the
  office.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Major Operations
    </h2>
    <p>
     There are four main departments in MJ&amp;B, each one of them
  almost autonomous from the other, though they share resources
  much as allied companies would. This has enabled the company to
  look as though they are paying attention to everything in the
  financial markets at once, though this is a myth.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Acquisitions
    </h3>
    <p>
     This department is the equivalent of the "hired gun" in the
  financial world. This corps of well-trained lawyers (law 4+) is
  loaned out to client companies (for a fee, of course), who then
  use their legal talent to acquire other companies. Quintessential
  corporate raiders, this group could be considered to be almost
  shock troops on the corporate battlefield. There are at current
  two Glass Walkers working for this department alone, though upper
  management does not realize this. (Author's note: One of these is
  a PC in the Chronicle I am currently running)
    </p>
    <h3>
     Insurance
    </h3>
    <p>
     MJ&amp;B has a very exclusive clientelle for this deparment,
  consisting almsot entirely of large banks, insurance and
  investment firms that refuse to use the protections provided by
  the government. None of the companies that they insure has gone
  under, though they often call their insurance advisor for advice
  on particularly troublesome cases.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Investments
    </h3>
    <p>
     This is the powerhouse of MJ&amp;B, where they have done their
  best work and amassed the most influence. This group has two
  functions: Analyze the market for favorable investment
  opportunities and conditions, and manage billions of dollars in
  assets through various member corporations.
    </p>
    <p>
     This group is most concerned with information gathering and
  prognostication, in the market sense. As such, they have amassed
  an impressive array of researchers and coordinators, who make
  some surprisingly accurate predictions on the nature and motion
  of the Market.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Legal
    </h3>
    <p>
     This group, unlike Acquisitions, above, is concerned with the
  protection of MJ&amp;B and the nullification of direct threats.
  Through the resources gathered in the Investment group, they can
  mount an effective legal attack on anyone, inidividual or
  collective, they so wish. They rarely lose in their legal
  challenges, and are often capable of ruining their target
  financially long before they win a court case.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Major Players
    </h2>
    <h3>
     Morgan Janniver
    </h3>
    <p>
     Janniver is of Belgian extraction, born in 1763 outside of
  Brussels. His father, a somewhat well-to-do banker, had taken
  something of an interest in the New World, so when Morgan was
  only 5 years old they emmigrated west, settling in the bustling
  port city of Boston, where the younger Janniver grew up.
    </p>
    <p>
     When he turned 18, he was sent back to Europe to study the art
  and trade of banking, under some of the most influential bankers
  of the time. It was here that Morgan Janniver was discovered to
  be advanced, and Awakenable, and therefore an asset to the
  Syndicate. By the time he was done with his schooling, he was a
  full-fledge and trained member of the Syndicate, and fully
  Awakened.
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon his return to Boston he proved to be a financial wizard,
  taking his fathers modest holdings and turning them into a
  somewhat large financial empire.
    </p>
    <p>
     Unfortunately, the Revolutionary War changed all that.
  Sections of Boston were burned, including his father's bank,
  leaving them both penniless. While Morgan had his contacts in the
  Syndicate, it was ot enough for his father, who died despondent
  only 6 months later.
    </p>
    <p>
     Janniver now began to ssemble a bank together again, working
  what little capital he could and acting as an accountant and a
  financial advisor to many individuals. One of these people was a
  doctor, who in turn repaid him by giving him an elixir that
  would, when taken annually, reverse the effects of aging on the
  body.
    </p>
    <p>
     At this point, he was given a long-term task, that involved
  focussing and directing the Sleeper efforts to colonize the West
  against the natives. As he began to do this, he came up with the
  idea of using insurance underwriting to influence what went
  where, and he began a smal company that eventually was folded
  into MJ&amp;B.
    </p>
    <p>
     Janniver appears to be in his mid 30s, though he is actually
  much, much older than this. He has a thoughtful gaze and deep,
  piercing eyes. His demeanor is steady, and patient, though he is
  quick of wit and mind. He has an incredible aptitude for the
  financial markets, and it is mostly his tutelage that has allowed
  MJ&amp;B to rise to its current position.
    </p>
    <p>
     Morgan Janniver is also an oddity amongst Syndicate magi: He
  is a fully Awakened willworker, and has a touch of knowledge in
  most all of the spheres. When cornered, he can work combat
  magics, traditionally the weakness of Syndicate magi in general,
  who tend to work more with abstractions. Janniver is not a mage
  to be trifled with.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Michelle Farralon
    </h3>
    <p>
     One of the younger clerks in Investments, she was hired right
  from college a an economist to help manage the flow of financial
  information within the company. SHe is also a very ell hidden NWO
  operative, here to gather intelligence on the "rogue" Janniver
  and his financial empire.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her work is incredibly effective, and efficient. She has been
  brought up through the ranks since childhood, having gone to
  school at the West Hills Academy for the Gifted and Talented (qv,
  coming soon), and then to a private university in
  Pennsylvania.
    </p>
    <p>
     She is trained in martial arts, and has spent much time
  learning surveillance techniques and intelligence gathering.
  Within her head is a pretty clear map of the entire operations of
  MJ&amp;B on any given day, and she knows most of the details of
  the lives of her co-workers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Unlike Janniver, Farralon is not an active, Vulgar willworker.
  She knows several coincidental effects from her martial arts
  training, but otherwise she knowis very little about magic,
  though she does know why she is keeping an eye on Janniver.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Alexander Dumonde
    </h3>
    <p>
     A hotshot young lawyer, Alexander is driven by a passion for
  his work that some of his coworkers liken to obsession. He is
  cold, cruel, and effective, often striking so fast and so hard in
  legal challenges it leaves his opponents cold, standing there
  stammering in court.
    </p>
    <p>
     He is also a Glass Walker Philodox, affiliated with the
  Mercy's Fist Sept on Alcatraz Island (qv, to be written up soon).
  He works very hard to keep hiscoworkers from knowing his true
  identity, though he suspects at least one of them knows or at
  least suspects, and fears there is Kinfolk in the office as
  well.
    </p>
    <p>
     He is here because of a warning that this group was furthering
  the cause of the Weaver, and might become corrupted by forces of
  the Wyrm. One of his recent acquisitions assignments was for a
  company that was taking over a Pentex subsidiary, and this has
  made him begin to wonder what is actually driving MJ&amp;B. He
  has spent many sleepless nights wondering if he is too involved
  in assisting this force. He knows nothing of Janniver's nature,
  however.
