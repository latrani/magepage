  <blockquote>
   Cayce was upside down, and he couldn't much say that he cared
    for it...The sound of screaming metal that appeared to be
    filling the world was the sound of Patterson's beloved jaguar
    rolling over and skidding and finally stopping. They had plowed
    into a mailbox.
   <p>
    "Stanzi. John. are you O.K.?
   </p>
   <p>
    no answer.
   </p>
   <p>
    " Hey! wake up guys. the Mib's will be here any second"
   </p>
   <p>
    A low moaning marked constanzi's position.still no answer
    from Patterson, not good.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Stanzi...Stanzi wake up!"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Urrrm, John you stupid pendaho.Ow!"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Stanzi!"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Justin? madre de dios, Justin! John's hurt!"
   </p>
   <p>
    An icy calm that Justin only felt in the thick of combat
    settled over him.unconsciously his hand strayed to his knife
    hilt.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Is he conscious?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "No."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Shit,he's the only one of us with life Magick...Is your
    laptop O.K? Is it running?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Find me a Hospital," A car door slammed, a pair of black
    wingtips approached, "and Hurry.."
   </p>
   <p>
    The hallway floor was very cool and invitingly stable.
    Constanzi considered passing out on it. Her vision was a bit
    blurry and head was clanging but even so her adrenaline
    wrenched her into an upright position. Justin was already up
    and running.
   </p>
   <p>
    " You! I've got a trauma case outside and I need a gurney
    and a crash cart Stat!"
   </p>
   <p>
    " are you a doctor?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Question me later rookie! this guy has multiple chest
    fractures. JUMP!"
   </p>
   <p>
    Orderlies started moving in every direction. Stanzi was
    amazed. With a practiced and precise grace they moved John into
    the E.R. and began ministering to him.
   </p>
   <p>
    Justin was in corner putting on a pair of rubber gloves.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Are you nuts?" she whispered as she approached, "you don't
    know anything about medicine."
   </p>
   <p>
    Justin looked up at her with a strangers eyes. " You're
    right. Justin doesn't know anything about medicine....Now get
    out of my way and let me work."

   There is little known and little used background in Mage, it's
  called Dream. Sure you've heard of it. Ever used it? O.K. maybe
  but have you really thought about it? Like all ill-defined things
  it is more than ripe for abuse, So...here, in a nutshell, is a
  nuts and bolts guide to a poorly understood game Mechanic.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Collective Unconscious:
  </h2>
  There are theories. Of
  course, as long as we have Hermetics, we are always going to have
  theories. Among Tradition mages it tends to go like this:
  <blockquote>
   "There is this deep place within the vast collective
    unconscious wherein all knowledge great and small resides...it
    finds it's expression in the lives of spirits and mortals. Some
    call it the Maya, some call it the dreamtime. Only those who
    can reach this place with their mind and touch it with their
    spirit may petition it for the knowledge it holds. Because it
    resides deep within all things it can and does act through many
    agents and in some cases will act in a completely unpredictable
    manner. But it will always nourish those who seek to know."
   <cite>
    -a purposefully anonymous Dreamspeaker.
   </cite>
  </blockquote>
  In some form or another, this is basically what most
  tradition mages teach their pupils who possess this
  weird-even-for-a-mage ability. With some variations of course....
  <p>
   Euthanatos,Verbena,Akashics,Dreamspeakers,cultists and most
  Hermetics subscribe to the above.
  </p>
  <p>
   Celestial chorus, enochian Hermetics, Khabalistic Hermetics,
  and Batini mages tend to view the process as the will of the
  divine working through the individual. This they say is why you
  sometimes get weird results. There may be some truth to this
  theory as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   Technomages, who as a rule do not consider the collective
  unconscious sentient and don't believe in god, seek to explain
  the phenomena itself. Virtuals, Etheric mages and some Void
  engineers call this "Comparative processing". the basic reasoning
  is this; by comparing a situation or problem to every piece of
  data in my mind and looking for patterns and similarities, I can
  find solutions to situation and problems that I have no direct
  knowledge or experience of. ( While this reasoning might seem
  specious, I can tell you from experience that it does in fact
  work in a limited way. I am an absolute machine at any form of
  standardized testing because of it. Although it is a stretch to
  say that because i can repair an outboard motor, so I ought to be
  able to perform thoracic surgery. Course...I'm not a mage:) In
  some cases there technomages fall back on the idea that all
  principles and axioms are the same and that gives them the
  paradigmic nudge they need. Progenitors have even posited the
  theory that the proteins that make up our D.N.A. have an unknown
  capacity for information,that past life experiences are made up
  from bits and pieces of ancestor memory and that each human being
  potentially carries the sum of the knowledge of his family tree.
  This theory has yet to be tested. Of the conventions, Iteration X
  eschews all theorizing on the subject as the Computer seeks to
  become a Collective Conscious.... Iterators with dream as a
  background are very rare and are usually considered a wild
  element.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nephandi mages take a typically inverted view of the
  Collective unconscious. They say that the knowledge that they
  receive is from Oblivion which contains all the knowledge that
  has ever been lost. While some Euthanatos and some Dreamspeaker
  are fascinated by they idea they still subscribe to an active
  rather than a passive force in the cosmos.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nobody really knows what the maruaders think about the subject
  but it is a known fact that Dream comes frighteningly easy to
  them and there are very few who do not have it.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Real Story:
  </h2>
  If you already have the Book of Worlds,
  then you already know a few things about the Maya and the astral
  realms. When a mage accesses his Dream ability he is basically
  manipulating the underlying structure of the Maya as it relates
  to him. Naturally he does both consciously and
  unconsciously...(it takes an effort of will to achieve but the
  mage has no idea how he is doing it or why it chooses to manifest
  as it does.)
  <p>
   As has been noted in other places sometimes a dreaming mage
  will ask for one thing and get something else which may or may
  not help. Because of the fluid nature of the Maya, and because of
  the power of the mages avatar, The Maya must respond but it may
  respond with whatever tools it has to hand. This usually depends
  on the specificity of the requested knowledge.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    A desperate mage reaches out with his mind for enough brawl
    knowledge to keep from getting his ass killed. Nearly every
    person on earth has been in fight or two so the knowledge leaps
    into the mind of the mage and he gets to walk out instead of
    being carried out.
   </li>
   <li>
    a mage who cannot read Babylonian finds that he must
    decipher a clay tablet, he calls on the dream score and finds
    that a linguistic spirit arrives and gives him the knowledge he
    seeks.
   </li>
   <li>
    a Mage who seek knowledge about a particular vampire finds
    that he is channeling an 18th century witch hunter. This kind
    of knowledge borrowing can get very nasty very quick.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>
   Mages and spirits and wraiths, Oh my!:
  </h2>
  The Maya may work
  through these disparate beings because they each share one thing
  in common...they sleep and they dream... occasionally spirits and
  Wraiths must deal with a phenomena called "Yanking" it has even
  been posited that mages who go into Quiet are being "Yanked"
  themselves. As it happens, a mage with a high dream score can
  sometimes make friends with the entities they are borrowing
  knowledge from or they can make bitter mortal enemies out of
  them. In almost all cases, many times when a spirit or wraith
  manifests they are completely unaware of the mage and unless the
  mage has spirit Magick and knows what to look for he will
  generally be unaware of what is going on too. Awareness of the
  spirit usually means that the mage has at least spirit 1 and
  notices that his own aura has taken on few different colors. ( it
  should be noted that working spirit Magick on a spirit while you
  are using dream to channel him is usually considered an
  attack,and will awaken the spirit in question who will usually be
  as mad as a wet chicken. Prime Magicks also have a small chance
  to awaken them but this is usually much gentler. Spirits like
  quintessence and awakening to the movement of quintessence can at
  times put them into a good mood.
  <h2>
   Benefits of Dream:
  </h2>
  <h3>
   1) An easy way to pick up common lore:
  </h3>
  The example above
  is a good way to illustrate how useful Dream can be in an
  emergency. But, Dream has other, simpler uses...It is a good way
  for mages to pick languages, not just the languages of countries,
  but those of the Romani, the howling and barking of Garou
  language, the languages of computers, and in some cases languages
  even more esoteric. It's an excellent way for an Etheric mage to
  pick up a scientific discipline that he is unfamiliar with for
  fast use or long research that verges into unfamiliar territory.
  <p>
   Another good way for this ability to be used is to do
  research. Here's an example; A Virtual Adept wants to know about
  Vampires. He takes a few days of staying at home and using dream
  to channel information about vampires, and then writing it all
  down on the old laptop. While the knowledge of Vampire lore fades
  every night, the data itself does not. As the character
  encounters more vampires his knowledge of them becomes more
  complete and fills in some blanks and inaccuracies.He has a ready
  made library of information that he can draw on and sooner or
  later that information starts to impress itself on the conscious
  mind as well. In this way, a player can either choose for the
  character to halve the cost of the talent,skill, or knowledge or
  he can choose to spend the full points on it, all at once, up to
  the limit of the dream score.
  </p>
  <p>
   While dream is an excellent way to pick up knowledges, It is
  also good for picking up skills and abilities of a physical
  nature. This also has unique advantages but also unique
  disadvantages. Channeling brawl is easy but channeling Ballet
  dancing is not. Channeling guitar is simplicity itself for
  someone who already plays another instrument and while the
  technical moves might still remain in the memory, the muscle
  memory does not. This is why, whenever channeling a strenuous
  physical activity,a mage must make a stamina roll against a
  difficulty of 8. Only one success is required. failure on this
  roll might mean a cramp or lingering stiffness perhaps even a
  sprain.
  </p>
  <p>
   A botch on this roll might result in torn ligaments or
  something broken. While it might seem risky to use this ability
  some Akashics and Euthanatos swear by this method. in their
  hands, an unfamiliar weapon or some found object becomes
  deadly.
  </p>
  <h3>
   2) Recovery of lost lore:
  </h3>
  Among mages this is known as
  "Knowledge Dowsing". While this is an invaluable tool to some
  mages it is not without its perils as I'll explain in a bit. At
  times this ability can be used to unearth lost languages,lost
  history, or even lost geography(!) There have been some cases of
  people channeling dead persons and writing symphonies while under
  the influence of "Automatic Writing" Most mages write these
  episodes off as a Wraith ability called skinriding but this is
  not always the case.
  <h3>
   3) Past life contact:
  </h3>
  There have been documented cases of
  mages who have gone to channel an ability and found that they
  possessed it in a past life and then finding that they are
  beginning to remember things of that life while that knowledge is
  being channeled...
  <p>
   As any Game master who reads this will realize, this is not
  always a good thing. While Euthanatos,Verbena and Akashic mages
  seem to have less problems in that respect even they are not
  immune and any widderslainte who peers back into their other
  lives is in for a horrifying ride. Etheric mages and Virtuals
  sometimes have to battle past lives to remain in the traditions.
  This is basically a door that the game master may choose to open
  at any time and in some ways it can very good or bad for the
  character. At times solving old past life conflicts can help with
  the struggle for arete or it can help psychological problems
  disappear but it can also be an invitation for the former life to
  shanghai the present life. Be warned.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Perils of Dream:
  </h2>
  <h3>
   1) Susceptibility to outside influences:
  </h3>
  When a mage
  opens himself to dreaming he is essentially dropping most of his
  spiritual defenses to act as an antenna for whatever the Maya
  sends. Some entities know this or can sense this. For this reason
  and this reason only it is unwise to attempt to use dream near a
  nihil or a severely Wyrm infested area. When a mage uses Dream,
  his ability to fight off external possession is reduced by 2 for
  the purposes of resisting Puppetry,Domination,or Possession
  charms of spirits or other forms of coercion. The only exception
  to this is Mind Magick. The dream users spiritual defenses may be
  dropped but this does not mean that his mental shields are
  disabled at all. However this can be circumvented with spirit
  Magick and/or some spiritual help.
  <p>
   Mages with a dream score of 4 or above find that their auric
  fields are particularly thin... as such, they often have a
  permanent -1 for resistance even when not using their dream
  score. When they use it, they are also subjected to the -2
  penalty.
  </p>
  <h3>
   2) Specificity breeds problems:
  </h3>
  One thing that most mages
  who have studied this phenomena can readily attest is that the
  more specific the knowledge sought, the more problems can arise.
  Mages who suppose that Dream is an easy road to lost lore often
  end up in extended Quiets.
  <p>
   Let me give you a couple of examples. Lets say that your mage
  wants to channel Chinese, Since there are billions of people who
  speak Chinese, this language just drops into his mind and he can
  speak it like a native.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lets say that this same mage need to decipher something
  written in ancient Mayan, since this knowledge is known by maybe
  a hundred living people, the mage is most likely to be contacted
  by a deceased Mayan,or a linguistic epiphling, and the mage might
  take on certain elements of that spirit personality for the
  duration...and sometimes beyond.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lets say that the mage wants to decipher a strange stone
  tablet with old glyph marking that predate mankind. Since no
  human ever knew that language, the Maya channels something that
  did... the mage then screams "Purple hairy SPIDERS!", drives his
  fingers into his eyes and then starts tearing Doissetep Keep
  apart stone by stone....
  </p>
  <p>
   You run into the same problems with knowledge as it becomes
  more personal. lets return to the example of the virtual adept
  who wants to know about vampires. If he just wants to know
  general vampire lore he's liable to get it free. If he wants to
  know about the vampires of a particular place or group he might
  end up channeling the City Father Totem of that city or he might
  " yank "some spirit that has links to the group, in the case of
  Giovanni or Samedi this will always be a ghost, in the case of
  thaumaturgically adept vampires, some other type of spirit might
  be yielded. in some cases the knowledge might come from the
  sleeping mind of a ghoul close to the group or clan. This can be
  a disaster if the sleeping ghoul is from one of the Sabbat ghoul
  families as many of them are thoroughly bent if not outright
  insane.
  </p>
  <p>
   If the Virtual adept wants to know information about one
  particular vampire he definitely runs the risk of channeling
  someone slain by that vampires and maddened by years or decades
  of frustration. Worse, if the Vampire has Necromancy as a
  discipline, word may get back to him. The mage might even be
  unwittingly influenced by the necromancer through the
  wraith.(hey, are you frightened yet?)
  </p>
  <h3>
   3) The Oneira:
  </h3>
  Some of the dream lords have a vested
  interest in certain types of knowledge, while Channeling mages do
  not have an effect on the Maya itself, some of the Oneira take a
  keen interest in the kinds of knowledge that goes out especially
  if it is part of their particular bailiwick. One Oneira was known
  to hunt a particular mage for stealing lost stories from the
  Maya. The Oneira sometimes take a notice in the antics of
  particular mages and ultimately it is an incredibly bad idea to
  annoy them as you gotta sleep sometime.
  <p>
   It is rumored, that the Oneira also protect some knowledge
  from being accessed. The Akashic Record possesses a legend about
  a contingent of their mages that traveled into the Maya and
  consulted a Chinese Oneira about the best way to keep others from
  learning the roots of Do. The Oneira, was payed a tribute,(what
  this was is different in each version of the legend) and in
  return he has kept that knowledge.
  </p>
  <p>
   Apparently, this is an extremely rare procedure and their are
  only a bare half dozen things that are flatly not accessible by
  the use of Dream. Few even know what they are. Do is one.
  Knowledge of Iteration X's Computer Root commands is another.
  (no-one is sure exactly how they pulled this off.) The lost
  spirits of the Bunyip,Croatan and the past lives of Silent
  Striders also remain lost in the mists of the Maya. No one knows
  who guards them.

   Justin was tired as he stripped off the gloves. Constanzi had
