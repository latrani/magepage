Okay, that's all of the IC posts for the time being.  This post will
begin to detail the Realms, both known and unknown, that have come from
the Archaeology series.  Also explained in this document is the Maze of
Dreams, a relic from the time before even the great Lost Empires.

Near Umbra Realms:

Pangaea - This is one of the shard Realms of Lemuria after the Fall.
 This realm represents the primitive beings of the Lemurian culture,
and the more priimitive but life-laden worlds they discovered. It
approximates the scientific era known as the Cenozoic, though nothing
more specific than this.

Battleground - This Realm was created by the Dying Curse of the High
Queen of Lemuria, and by the death-cries of those around her as they
fell in the landfall battle with the Atlantean forces.  As such, many
of the battles that may be encountered here will be great magical
duels, seemingly fantastic battles that seem to be the underpinning of
this place.  Characters will not, however, see any shade of the Queen,
as her shade was spared imprisonment in this place.

Aquaria - This Realm is composed entirely of water, though any creature
that enters it can breathe normally.  THe waters are tteming with life,
and kelps and fish grow to unnatural sizes and flourish in these warm
waters.  This Realm contains any and all aquatic animals that were
discovered by the Lemurian people, and includes four sentient races
with some semblance of civilization: Dolphins, Selkies (not to be
confused with the fae of the same name), Merfolk, and Troglodytes
(again not to be confused with Fae of the same name)

Arborea - A manifestation of the forested areas of Lemuria,
particularly those near the garden, this Realm is covered in lush
forests, ranging from deep, steamy tropical valleys to high and arctic
taigas.  Wildlife again is very abundant, and many Garou are here,
mistakenly believing that this Realm is in fact Wolfhome.

The Abyss - This great chasm is in fact the hole that was created by
the Great Crystal dishcharging through the center of the Gaian
Tellurian towards the Lemurian home Realm.  The pit literally goes
onward down to the primal nothingness that lies beneath existence.  It
is believed by some hat the City of Pyramids was once a Lemurian holy
site at the edge of the garden, but this cannot be decided for certain
(Kudos to Anders Sandberg for that idea...  Sory for co-opting it)

Deep Umbra

The Shard Realms - Atlantis's slow decay and dissolution was the result
of them seperating and categorizing the various essences of their
culture and their world into discreet packages.  As they began to
compartmentalize more, the land slowly split and broke into these
twined Realms.  They have only partial links to the Planetary Telluria
that they are supposed to be attached to, being attached more firmly to
the Gaian Tellurian.  Within the Realms, if one is careful to look,
there lay evidence of the Atlantean culture, though it is often
mistaken for mere geologic debris.  Oddly enough, no form of
retrocognition will reveal the nature of the people who came before,
almost as though they were erased from history.

The Garden - Only rumors exist of this place, the ultimate paradise.
 It is believed to have spawned the legend of the Garden of Eden,
though it has truly little to do with the Judeo-Christian myth of the
same name.  THe Garden itself is only about 70 miles in radius, with a
single ivory tower in the center, formerly the heart of the Lemurian
civilization.  The creatures that live here are all intelligent, and
possess great charms, plus knowledge of the spheres of Life (3), Prime
(2), Forces and Entropy (1).  Characters will find themselves meeting
more powerful and less friendly creatures the closer to the tower they
get, though hunting animals for food is allowed without supernatural
resistance.  Attempts to use Correspondence are resisted by the Realm,
but not via paradox.  All Correspondence effects that move characters
closer to the Tower will be at -3 successes, and all those moing away
from the Tower (but not out of the Realm) will be at +3 successes (i.e.
almost impossible to botch). Any character "fortunate" enough to gain
access will find it guarded by two spirits, near Incarna level, who
will guard the Tower with their life.  If these are somehow
circumvented, inside the Tower lay all the knowledge of the Lemurian
people.  (Note to STs:  This should NEVER occur!!!!  The Lemurians knew
magics that make the Oracles look like apprentices.  You may wish a
small scrap of knowledge out, as the center point of an adventure)

Malfeas - Malfeas is the archetypical home of the Wyrm, the location
stumbled upon by the Lemurians in their travels.  It is as dark a palce
as imagined by the Garou, and moreso.  It has slowly drifted toward the
Gaian Tellurian as the Wyrm grows in strength here.

Parallel Telluria - There are many, many more Telluria than Gaia,
distributed about the space known as the Deep Umbra.  Malfeas lies
within the Tellurian known as Tarterus, and Arcadia lies closer in
toward the "center" of existence.  Each of these various Telluria have
their own properties, and many of them have a Celestine (or rarely two)
at the ceter of them, though they tend to be dormant in the middle
realm, where Gaia is located.

The Maze of Dreams - As new Telluria form, they tend to gain creatures
that shape small Realms around them.  These Realms grow, slowly,
merging with others, some passageways forming between them that
stabilize from time to time, sometime permanent.  Occasionally, after a
Realm has been around for some time, there is an "artifact" of this
earlier period left around, a collection of small, almost microscopic
realms that are interconected by a webwork of pathways.  The Maze of
Dreams is one such area in the Gaian Tellurian.  A collection of small
nodes and interconecting passageways, the Maze is movable, and shapable
by the wills of more adept magi.  The Maze of Dreams cuttently lies in
the Bay Area of California, though some think the micro-network extends
as ar north as Seattle and British Columbia, and as far south as
Central America, though few believe this.  The Maze is jealously
guarded by the Garou and Tradition magi that know of it, as it could be
a very powerful weapon in the hands of their enemies.

(Well, again, that's another chunk.  Tell me what you think!)
