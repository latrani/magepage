   The Architecture Of Doom
  </h1>
  <hr>
   Buildings often shape how we see things. Some buildings give a
  feeling of age, stability and of staid conservatism. Some give a
  feeling of dynamics, progress and a ruthless will to succeed.
  Some are warm, soft, a bit worn but still comfortable, places
  inhabitants feel at home in despite the inconveniences. Most
  buildings are very human places. But the buildings of Antonio
  Ricci are not built for humans, they are built for the beings he
  serves.
   <p>
    Antonio Ricci is a somewhat well-known architect in certain
  circles. He was a pupil of the Norwegian architect Niels Torp,
  but started his own firm, Ricci Architecture, in the early 80's.
  His first major project was the new headquarters for Leon
  Transports Inc. in Atlanta. The original design and the ingenious
  use of zig-zag corridors to make the most out of the limited
  space made him famous in design circles. After that he has
  designed several buildings, mainly office buildings. His style is
  rather unique, based very much on obtuse angles, clean and
  straight lines and a fascination with glass, mirrors, and metal.
  Most of his buildings are very irregular structures, with large
  halls, zig-zag corridors, no right angles anywhere and large
  windows letting in light everywhere. His works have won him
  several prizes, including the coveted Henderson Award in 1989 for
  his bold design of the regional headquarters of Shahashiro
  Corporation in San Francisco.
   </p>
   <p>
    What nobody knows is that Antonio's designs have another
  purpose beside being innovative uses of space and material. They
  are also parts of his Labyrinth. Antonio Ricci is in fact a full
  Nephandi mage, and his architecture is an ingenious plan to help
  his masters reach Earth. By aligning the odd angles and lines of
  his buildings, he has created weird Correspondence effects. The
  obtuse angles of his buildings can be used as portals for beings
  from the Deep Umbra to reach Earth, and the odd structure of the
  buildings causes the Gauntlet and Horizon to shift and bend,
  opening up gates to other places. By walking down the corridors
  in the right manner, people can walk from one building to another
  without realizing it. Or they can walk into the Umbra. This has
  caused a few disappearances in buildings designed by Ricci over
  the last years, but nobody has made any connection between them.
  In fact, all his buildings are really jig-saw pieces fitting
  together into one great labyrinth extending into the Deep Umbra.
  This is however rather hard to notice. People with awareness tend
  to get uncomfortable in his buildings, but most think its because
  they are so cold and technocratic. People who actually study them
  with Correspondence will start to notice weird alignments and
  that the angles are all slightly wrong.
   </p>
   <p>
    His buildings serve several functions. Partly, they are the
  physical manifestations of his labyrinth. Partly, they serve as
  sources for humans who occasionally wander into it and are
  consumed by its inhabitants. Parts of the buildings function as
  his sanctum. This can be as small as a certain corner or as large
  as a courtyard. These places all form a secret pattern only
  Antonio understands, and inside he can work his magick freely.
  Finally, some of the buildings function as nodes fuelling the
  labyrinth. Antonio soon realized that the Technocracy often used
  avenues and highways as ley-lines, and by exploiting some of the
  stranger effects of his buildings he was able to tap into them
  without anybody noticing. In fact, his style is quite popular
  among some technomancers, which has helped him even more. His
  buildings also weaken the Gauntlet, albeit not perceptibly. If
  they were shifted a tiny bit, their aligned angles would support
  each other and a massive breach would result, but so far Antonio
  has decided to play it safe instead, designing more buildings to
  make his labyrinth stronger.
   </p>
   <p>
    His Labyrinth is a place of twisted angles, immense halls,
  zig-zag corridors, irregular rooms, windows and mirrors
  reflecting and breaking up everything into angular images.
  Everything is clean and deserted, like a major office at night.
  The only sound is of the ventilation system. There is no outside
  or inside, just more rooms. In the nights Antonio used to dance
  laughing and chanting through the halls, darting in and out into
  the buildings in the real world, cavorting with the beings he
  finds in his labyrinth and singing praises to his lords and to
  the angles.
   </p>
   <p>
    Antonio became a Nephandi when he one day made a wrong turn in
  one of Niels Torp's buildings. Instead of winding up in an
  office, he found himself in a weird labyrinth of odd angles and
  frightening structures. Exactly what he did and who he met is
  unknown, but he returned a few days later as a changed man. He
  began to pursue his own ideas, and amazed his colleagues with his
  amazing grasp of space and how to use it. A few months later he
  quit working for Torp and founded Ricci Architecture.
   </p>
   <p>
    Antonio is a rather young and good-looking man, with dark hair
  and brown eyes. He always dresses according to fashion and
  surrounds himself with tasteful, slightly expensive things. His
  friends and associates like his quirky humor and many
  eccentricities. Only his closest friends or his assistants see
  the darker side of him, his obsession with corners and labyrinths
  and his sudden attacks of euphoria.
   </p>
   <p>
    Antonio doesn't think of himself as a mage. He sees himself as
  an architect, designing the universe. In his dreams and visions
  he sees reality as it could be, filled with wonderful angles and
  buildings. He knows that nobody else would understand it, so he
  carefully translates his visions into architecture or art (he has
  a large collection of drawings, plans and sketches of truly
  unearthly structures). At the same time he is also deeply happy
  when he knows he is furthering his vision in any way. That
  disturbs him a bit, since he likes to be in control over his
  emotions.
   </p>
   <p>
    Antonio is a solitary mage, but has succeeded well despite (or
  because this). No other Nephandi know about his existence. He
  hasn't got any true acolytes, but his assistants help him with
  designing his buildings. Several architects have also been
  influenced by him, and imitate his style. While their buildings
  doesn't automatically connect to the labyrinth, Antonio can
  connect it to them with some work, and he is constantly on the
  lookout of more pieces to the great jig-saw puzzle.
   </p>
   <p>
    At his home (designed by himself and connected to the
  Labyrinth), he has a great studio and library, filled with
  strange books and pictures filled with labyrinths, buildings and
  geometrical objects. He spends much time here designing new ideas
  and drawing pictures of them. This is also the main center of his
  sanctum, and by simply walking into a corner or doorway he may
  emerge anywhere in his distributed sanctum.

   Antonio uses somewhat unusual foci. To manipulate people he
  uses mirrors and reflections, often hypnotizing his victims. For
  Correspondence he uses angles and corners. To be able to
  manipulate space he needs angles, either drawn or (preferably)
  built. He prefers obtuse angles, and tends to avoid right angles,
  but he can use them too. Rooms or places with no angles and
  smooth curves are repugnant to him, and he becomes nervous and
  irritated. He uses buildings to manipulate Prime and Spirit. To
  use them he needs a building designed by himself or sufficiently
  close to his style.
   <p class="c1">
    Some rotes:
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Open Corner (Spirit 3 Correspondence 3):
    </b>
    By simply
  walking into a corner Antonio can emerge in any other corner
  inside his buildings or his Labyrinth.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Exit, Right (Correspondence 3):
    </b>
    Antonio is very good at
  finding his way through the buildings he has created, and the
  coincidental explanation is that he is able to simply turn a
  corner and vanish.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Mirror, Mirror (Mind 2 Correspondence 2):
    </b>
    Antonio looks
  into a broken or angled mirror, and can look out through any
  similar mirror or reflecting surface (usually in his buildings).
  Beside watching distant places, he can also influence the
  feelings of anybody looking at the surface by making faces. If he
  smiles, the victim will feel happy. If he frowns, they will turn
  nervous, and so on. Antonio has used this to manipulate officials
  and executives to get his proposals approved or hinder
  competitors.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     The Angles Are All Wrong (Correspondence 2 Mind 3):
    </b>
    Sometimes Antonio wants to catch somebody or immobilize them. He
  then uses angular mirrors to shine light on the victim (perhaps
  through a reflective surface or window if the victim is far
  away), and creates a disorienting effect. The victim will start
  to feel confused as his sense of spatial relationships starts to
  act up. He can't tell how far something is, how to get there or
  if something is behind or in front of something else. Angles and
  surfaces seems to twist and dance around him, and with enough
  successes Antonio can make the victim completely incapable of any
  action.
   </p>
   <p>
    [Each success increases the difficulty of all actions
  requiring rational thought or understanding of spatial
  relationships with one.]
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Shatter the Mirror (Mind 3 Spirit 4):
    </b>
    Sometimes Antonio
  has to eliminate somebody, and then he uses mainly this rote (or
  the Corner Hunters). The victim has to be present in one of his
  buildings, in a room with mirrors, windows or reflecting
  surfaces. The magick shatters them into a myriad of shards,
  reflecting and refracting the Deep Umbra. Behind them the corners
  and angles open to reveal his true Masters. The rote links the
  mind of the victim to them, which almost inevitably causes total
  insanity to all humans. What happens then depends upon both the
  victim, the Masters and the intentions of Antonio. Some victims
  just vanish into the Deep Umbra. Others are simply left incurably
  insane.
   </p>
   <h2>
    The Corner Hunters
   </h2>
   The hunters inhabit the labyrinth and
  the buildings connected to it. They are never seen, just felt as
  unseen presences right around a corner, behind a closed door or
  inside another room. Maybe they are invisible, or maybe they look
  terrible. Nobody knows, except maybe Antonio who isn't telling.
  Normally the hunters are content to lurk in the labyrinth and
  just watch what is going on. But sometimes they get hungry, and
  using their grasp of Correspondence they lure victims into the
  labyrinth and devour them without a trace.

     Correspondence 3:
    </b>
    The hunters can silently and
  discreetly move from place to place without being seen. They just
  appear somewhere else. However, smooth curves hinder them.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Correspondence 2:
    </b>
    The hunters always know what is
  happening around them or in nearby parts of the labyrinth.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Mind 3:
    </b>
    The hunters can manipulate the perceptions of
  space and localization of people, to trick them into their lairs
  or lead them deeper into the labyrinth.
