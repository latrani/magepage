                            SAPPHIRE AND STEEL  
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
'All irregularities will be handled by the forces controlling each 
dimension....Transuranic heavy elements will not be used where there 
is life.....Medium Atomic Weights are available....Sapphire and Steel 
have been assigned.'  
                    - (quote from the opening sequence in the series)
    
---------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Do not confuse anything in here with my Continuum 'Tradition'!! 
While there are similarities (you can see where I get my ideas from), 
the actual mechanics and organisation are completely different!
---------------------------------------------------------------------
  
    'Sapphire and Steel' describes the adventures of two members of 
an organization dedicated to keeping Time on a single track. This 
organization does not appear to be composed of humans, or even of 
entities from within our own timestream. Members of the Continuum are 
in a constant battle with Time itself, which perpetually seeks to 
break through into the present to destroy our reality. As such, the 
Continuum must be composed of beings which transcend mere humans to 
an unimaginable degree. In almost all cases , Time uses humans to 
break through into the present - they are often completely unaware 
of their actions, and can unwittingly endanger the current reality. 
Time is constantly aware of the Continuum, and always tries to get 
rid of Continuum Agents if they become involved - sometimes it is 
successful.

    CONTINUUM AGENTS: There are 127 Continuum Agents in existence, 
all very different from eachother. There are two main Divisions of 
Continuum Agents, referred to by codenames - they are Elementals and 
Field Ops. The two Divisions have very different abilities, and 
rarely work together. Elementals are often called out by Field Ops 
who cannot handle a problem on their own.    

    ELEMENTALS: There are 52 Elementals in existence, each 
representing an Element in the Periodic Table ranging from Atomic 
Number 20 to 104 - not all elements are represented by the Continuum. 
Known Elementals include Radium, Copper, Silver, Lead and Gold. 
Elementals are specialists, and as such are usually held in reserve 
until called up by field operatives (Field Ops). Elemental abilities 
are usually much more powerful than those of the Field Ops, who by 
necessity must be more adaptable and less specialized.  
  
    TRANSURANICS: 12 of the 52 Elementals are Transuranics, 
representing elements from 93 to 104 inclusive. Transuranic 
Elementals are highly unstable, and as such are not used where there 
is life. While they are invariably mentally disturbed (all are 
utterly insane), their powers may also be deadly to lifeforms - for 
example, if Plutonium 'takes back time', he may do so by drastically 
ageing all lifeforms nearby. Transuranics often do not care that they 
are unstable - as such they are mavericks within the Continuum, 
tolerated only because of their usefulness in certain situations. 
None are actually seen in the series.
   
    FIELD OPS: There are 75 Field Ops in existence - all are referred 
to by codenames representing Minerals or Alloys. For example, known 
Field Ops include Jet, Sapphire, Steel, and Diamond. 
    [NB. While there is no Elemental called Carbon, Diamond is still 
classed as a Field Op codename since it is not Carbon in its pure 
elemental form.]  
    Field Ops are the workhorses of the Continuum - they are the 
detectives and repairers of the damaged timestream. Their job is to 
locate areas of 'weakened reality', known as Pressure Points (where 
Time has found an area which it can penetrate) and reinforce them to 
prevent Time from breaking through.      
    Mineral Field Ops (such as Sapphire, Jet, and Diamond) appear to 
be the ones who find a problem , while the Alloys (such as Steel) 
appear to be the ones who actually solve it. As such, Minerals tend 
to have detection powers (Mind, Prime and Time), while Alloys have 
more physical Abilities (eg. Matter, Forces, Life).

Character Notes 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SAPPHIRE (played by Joanna Lumley)

    Sapphire appears to be the one who calms down everyone caught in 
a region of Weakened Reality - she seems to be able (through force of 
personality (and her appearance)) to be able to comfort those humans 
caught in the rift. 
    Her powers are primarily detection - especially Telepathy (She'd 
probably have Mind 3) though she is capable of 'taking back time'. 
This is an effect not really quantifiable in Mage - it'd probably be 
a Correspondence 5/Time 5 effect. This seems to involve 'rewinding' 
time so that Sapphire and Steel can escape a nasty situation. 
However, its not quite as obvious as that. Thinking about it, she 
can only do this in areas that are 'outside' the main timestream 
(ie. to places where the Agents have been 'diverted to' by whatever 
force they are dealing with to get them out of the way). Sounds 
familiar....? I think this is actually their way of getting out of a 
Paradox Realm!


STEEL (played by David MacCallum)

    Steel's powers are rarely mentioned. I think he's more of a 
'Matter' person than anything else, though he does have a telepathic 
link with Sapphire. He is very cold and intimidating, and takes his 
work very seriously - he has no time to mollycoddle the humans 
trapped in the Pressure Point. He has been known to freeze himself 
(by adapting the components of a freezer (very Sons of Ether...!) to 
absolute zero in Adventure 1 to free Sapphire from a trap set up by 
their enemies. This did put him out of action for a while afterwards, 
but he survived nonetheless. 



---------------------------------------------------------------------
    TIME AND REALITY: Time cannot be thought of as an individual 
entity - the 'true face of Time' is about as alien as you can get. 
Time may be thought of as a chaotic force, perpetually trying to 
rupture the fabric of our universe - the Continuum must prevent this 
from occurring. Occasionally Time does not even have to try to cause 
problems - humans have been known to unwittingly create areas of 
weakened reality on their own, through which Time can break through. 
      Weakened areas of reality are sometimes created by human 
experiments, but most often are caused by Memories. A Memory is 
something which preserves an aspect of a previous time. This can be 
anything from an old photograph (or painting) to a historical 
recreation of past events, or even a simple memory remembered by a 
human. Historical recreations are quite effective in creating areas 
of Weakened Reality - Time can break through to pull the entire area 
back to the period being recreated!!!   
    Time manifests itself in our Universe as 'Ghosts', or images from 
the past. Note that there have also been references in the Series to 
creatures from `outside the Corridor of Time' - it appears that these 
forces are also things that the Continuum has to deal with on 
occasion.    

   
=====================================================================  
                            THE SERIES  
                            ~~~~~~~~~~
                            
SERIES NOTES:   It should be noted that the Series is entirely 
unconventional - certainly it was way ahead of its time when it was 
first shown in the early 1980s, which was probably why not many 
people understood it. However, underneath the obscure appearance lies 
a highly original concept which is open to considerable expansion. 
    Apparently it did prove quite popular, but unfortunately a TV 
Technician's strike half way through Adventure 2 meant that it 
couldn't be shown on TV for about 2 months - by the time it had 
resumed, most people had lost interest in the series. Nevertheless, 
it continued for a total of 6 adventures (each consisting of between 
4 and 8 half-hour episodes), reaching a definite conclusion in the 
final adventure.      

    It seems that the series was set entirely in `the present'.  
While Sapphire could `take back time' for short periods, actual Time 
Travel was out of the question. Indeed, the Transient Beings (the 
antagonists in Adventure 6) seemed to have once been `imprisoned in 
the past', implying that the past was something that could never be 
reached.

    Very little background was hinted at during the course of the 
series - all we knew was that Sapphire and Steel were NOT human, 
certainly not from this world (past or future) , and that they were 
Field Operatives for a larger (unnamed) organization. Their origins, 
the source of their powers, and the reasons for their existence were 
never revealed - which was good in a sense because this kept a sense 
of mystery throughout the series. Indeed , the full extent of Steel's 
powers were not made clear in the slightest, although it seems that 
he had considerable ability to alter the properties of his body (in 
one scene, he froze himself to Absolute Zero and still managed to 
walk and talk!! - in another, he stopped Sapphire stabbing herself 
with a carving knife by blocking the knife with his hand (which was 
unblemished  afterwards)).  
    We also see a couple of Elementals during the course of the 
series - Lead and Silver. This leads me on to an interesting side 
point - which came first , the character or the codename?! Sapphire, 
for example, is usually dressed in blue (like a sapphire), and her 
eyes glow blue when she uses her powers. Steel always dresses in 
(steel-)grey suits, and is literally as cold as steel in character. 
Lead is a huge imposing figure of massive strength - his ability
is to prevent rifts in time from spreading. Finally, Silver is a 
lithe, grey-haired man who can alter the structure of metals with his 
hands. Also, Jet is mentioned and referred to as a female - 
presumably a tall thin black woman, raising the possibility that all 
Field Ops with `Gemstone' codenames (ie. Sapphire, Jet, Diamond) are 
women.


PLOT SUMMARIES: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
    In Adventure 1 of the series, Sapphire and Steel must prevent 
creatures from the Corridor of Time from breaking through into the 
present using old nursery rhymes. Also features Lead. 
     In Adventure 2, the weakened area is an abandoned Railway 
station, and the force that Sapphire and Steel must stop has already 
arrived - a force which feeds off the hatred and resentment of the 
dead. The force is assembling an army of the dead who have died 
needlessly. I think this one is the best of the lot.
    In Adventure 3, the presence of a family from the future are 
creating a dangerous imbalance in Time, which must be remedied by 
Sapphire and Steel.
    In Adventure 4, an experimental technique which combines old and 
new photos unleashes a force which can trap people in photographs.  
    In Adventure 5, an amazingly accurate historical reconstruction 
of a company's founding at a party in 1980 creates a rift in Time 
which sends the entire party back to 1930, when the company was 
founded. Guests born after 1930 begin to die, so that Time can 
replay events at the original party and prevent a scientist's death, 
thus dooming the entire planet!!!!  
    In Adventure 6, Sapphire and Steel face some very dangerous foes 
from the past - the Transient Beings - in a service station/cafe that 
appears to contain people from many times. In addition, the whole 
area seems to be caught in a Time loop. In the ensuing battle, 
Sapphire and Steel find themselves lured into a trap and are hurled 
outside Time.
