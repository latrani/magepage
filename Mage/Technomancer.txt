Arthur Kell is a technomancer. However, unlike what most mages 
believe about the Technocracy, he is not a mage in the ordinary 
sense. He don't bend reality using his Will. Instead he relies on 
much more useful mundane methods like bureaucracy, contacts, 
technology and media to bring about the changes he want. When a 
mage would use Mind to control a person, Kell finds out his price 
and bribe him. When a mage would use Forces to destroy a 
building, Kell would make the City condemn the house and send in 
a wrecking crew. Whether this is extremely subtle coincidental 
magick or completely mundane methods is anybodys guess.

Arthur Kell is a fortyish man, slightly balding with black hair. He is 
of average length and weight. He wear conservative suits, and tend 
to disappear in crowds quite well. He is quite polite to everyone, 
and gives the general impression of a unassuming middle level 
bureaucrat in some large organisation. Which is quite true. He 
works for the Syndicate as a trouble-shooter. Whenever 
Technocracy reality is disturbed, or may become disturbed, the 
Syndicate sends him in if they feel he would be appropriate.

The speciality of Arthur is Traditional mages. He has a long 
experience of dealing with them, and know disturbingly much 
about the Traditions philosophies, methods and plans. More 
conservative technomancers prefer to enforce the Pogrom all the 
time, and try to destroy any encountered tradition mages whenever 
possible. Arthur regard this as a waste of energy, and prefer to 
make the mages change their minds or even help the Technocracy. 
Whether they know about it or not depend upon the situation, as 
does the methods Arthur uses.

He has had a surprising success with diplomatic means. He has 
taken contact with the mages and explained the situation to them. 
He points out the consequences of their actions, and why these 
consequences are bad for themselves. He carefully points out ways 
the mages can avoid conflicts with the Technocracy, and still 
perform their magick and fulfil some of their goals. His advice is 
always useful and correct, and most mages find it in their own 
interest to follow it. Arthur prefers not to try to trap the mages he 
talks to, and usually try to show them that it is a fair deal. 

Arthur is a master at finding out what people want, and find ways 
to give them it. He is also quite adept at making people change their 
minds, using persuasion, guilt, bribes or subtle intrigue. Many 
mages have never realised that Arthur have manipulated them. A 
mage who want to become rich and powerful in the mundane world 
will be approached by a representative from a medium sized 
corporation. The representative explains that they have been 
looking for someone with the right qualifications for a important 
position, and the mage just happens to have exactly the right 
qualifications. Subtle touches will make the mage believe that he 
subconsciously have used his magick to coincidentally gain power 
and wealth. The mage, who will be given a comfortable and 
rewarding job, never suspects that he is working for a sub-branch 
of the Syndicate.

Arthur sometimes have two bodyguards from the Men in Black, but 
he prefers to work from his office, calling mages and talking to 
them. He prefers to use quite ordinary equipment as fax, phone, an 
office computer and normal human interaction instead of the 
extreme high-tech of the Technocracy. Of course, he knows he is 
bugged, and quite possibly even cybernetically modified. To 
minimise the risk that the Traditions would gain important 
information about the Technocracy from him, he has deliberately 
avoided learning anything too secret or dangerous about the 
Technocracy. He works alone most of the time, reporting back to his 
unseen superiors. If needed, they can send support.
