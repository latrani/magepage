Subject: Some ideas for symbolic Chronicle / Story creation ...
Message-ID: <Pine.3.87.9404211422.A11464-0100000@crl.crl.com>

Well, I've had what, to me, feels like a breakthrough with creating 
interesting, dynamic stories using symbols.

Below are the conventions and traditions of the technocracy and their 
corresponding symbology in my games and in my head.  :)
This is, by no means meant to be a "truth" about what each of these 
things symbolize, but I thought I would share my ideas to see what other 
people think.

Technocracy = Oppression
	New World Order = The Government
	The Syndicate = The Market
	Iteration X = The Military
	Progenitors = Fecundity, the perversion of nature
	Void Engineers = Exploration for puropses of conquering (The 
			Conquistedors)

Traditions = Enlightenment
Enlightenment through :
			Akashic Brotherhood = Self - control
			Celestial Chorus = Religion
			Cult of Ecstasy = Ecstasy
			Dreamspeakers = Spirituality
			Euthanotos = Death / Rebirth
			Hollow Ones = Emptiness (?)
			Order of Hermes = Intellect
			Sons of Ether = Science
			Verbenna = Nature
			Virtual Adepts = Alternative choices			

And what are those things that keep people from Enlightenment?
Hatred, Anger, Fear, Disease, Gluttony, Jealousy, Envy, Greed, Narrow 
Mindedness, Closed Mindedness, Boredom, Corruption ... etc.

So, maybe, to craete a really open-ended chronicle ... use one of the 
symbols from "things that keep people from enlightenment" and personify 
it as the major antagonist in a chronicle ... or as several smaller 
antagonists.
i.e. Corruption (what do you think when you think "corruption"?) = 
Demons, The Government (a.k.a the New World Order), money ... those 
themes could all figure very heavily in several stories until the 
characters finally meet with the major personification of Corruption in 
the game and overcome him/her/it or are consumed by him/her/it.
And, is using sorruption, don't forget to use the symbol against the 
character in a personal kind of way ... using a corrupting force to push 
the Akashic Brither to lose control of himself, or undermine the Oder of 
Hermes magi's cherished theories (and destroy all his notes and books).

Disease = Dissention <say ... within a chantry>, Progenitors, physical, 
social and mental diseases of all types.

Anyway ... I hope you understand all this rambling ...
