   <h2>
    Verbena Paradigm
   </h2>

  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    The Paradigm - Nature
   </b>
   . Nature holds primordial truths
  for all to learn. Other traditions tend to see Reality "top
  down," looking through the lens of their paradigms. The Verbena
  try to see from "bottom up" by letting what they see in Nature
  create their paradigms. Since Willworkers can influence Nature,
  She can learn from them as well. Future Verbena can then learn
  from the lessons Nature has learned. And it so it shall ever
  continue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Seeing the many forms Nature takes, the Verbena believe in a
  multiplicity of paths. This is in part represented by the
  countless deities they worship. Because Nature is also One, the
  Verbena think these paths and deities are also One. However,
  Willworkers choose to value the seeming differences Nature has
  created. So, while Traditions like the Technocracy, the Virtual
  Adepts, the Sons of Ether, and the Celestial Chorus may not be
  wrong per se, their extreme "top down" orientation often leads
  them to try to silence the Voice of Nature. This makes their
  views highly suspect to most Verbena.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Ascension - "Light in Darkness, Whole in One."
   </b>
   The true
  mistress of the Mysteries will be able to respectfully and
  lovingly embody Nature in all its unity and all its diversity.
  This is why the Verbena are said to seek an Ascension of Self.
  Other Verbena say seek something like godhood - becoming
  completely and totally some aspect of Nature, just as the gods of
  legend are. Some view this godhood as but a step on the way to
  Ascension of Self. These are the most common views but there are
  others. You will hear them if you go anywhere the Verbena gather
  to drink mead.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Magick - Willworking.
   </b>
   Another Verbena proverb is "What
  is Willed will Be." By keen observation, communion, and
  friendship with Nature, the Verbena can ask Her to do what they
  want. Nature is harsh with Willworkers that make Her do things
  that She does not want to do (in part because Her dreams have
  been corrupted by the Technocracy). While friends can get away
  with a lot with each other, friendship has its price and its
  limits. The watchwords of Verbena magick are Respect and
  Cooperation, though like all truisms, they sometimes must be
  ignored in favor of a greater good.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Arete - Wisdom
   </b>
   . Witchcraft is the work of the Wise.
  Verbena compare this growth to that of the Oak. It starts out
  being very small, but if it survives to adulthood, it becomes the
  mother of many trees and provides homes for animals and shade for
  people. Just as the Verbena grow, so they will be able to do more
  and have more of a positive impact.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Quintessence - Heart's Blood, Blood
   </b>
   . Blood is the
  substance that contains the life force of living things. The
  Blood of Nature contains the vital force of Nature itself.
  Verbena using the power of sympathetic magick often use mundane
  blood and ritual sacrifice along with Heart's Blood to make their
  magick more powerful.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Paradox - Banefulness
   </b>
   . This is when Nature sees your
  will moving against Her's. Sometimes it needs to be done, but
  Nature is rarely kind about it.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Spheres - The Paths of the Gods.
  </h3>
  <p>
   Willworkers tend to worship whatever deities they find to be
  useful. While Verbena will usually pay at least lip service to
  all gods, some masks of divinity are more difficult for them to
  accept than others. Some Verbena would find it hard to follow the
  Path of Odin because that god has been linked to the Nazis, for
  instance. So, the names below are not fixed in any way. Some
  Willworkers come from strong Celtic roots and have found deities
  from that tradition to work with. The names below assume the
  Willworker was apprenticed in a more eclectic version of Verbena
  tradition.
  </p>
  <p>
   Using a certain Path is as much about worshipping and
  respecting the goddess or god as it is about becoming that deity
  and understanding her or his place in Nature. It should also be
  noted that the deities often have more than one face. Paths can
  often heal as well as harm, just as the Great Goddess is usually
  thought of as being Maid, Mother, and Crone.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Correspondence - The Path of Hecate
   </b>
   . The Greeks made
  stone shrines to Hecate at crossroads. Hecate's understanding of
  space can be used by the Willworker to move people and things
  amazing distances in no time at all, or even to make new kinds of
  crossroads in space. In her more bellicose affects, She helps the
  Willworker in battle.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Entropy - The Path of Kali
   </b>
   . Kali is the force that
  destroys and brings death, and as such is to be honored as part
  of life and nature. As Death, She knows the many secrets of
  death, decay, and transformation of all kinds.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Forces - The Path of Pele
   </b>
   . Pele's literal embodiment is
  that of a volcano. She is also symbolic of the titanic energies
  available on this very dynamic path.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Life - The Path of Demeter
   </b>
   . Demeter is one of many
  faces of the Earth Goddess. By learning the secrets of the
  seasons and the rhythms of life, the Willworker learns all sorts
  of useful techniques with which to heal or harm. Because the Path
  is so closely aligned with the Verbena's ideas learning from and
  participating in Nature, they tend to be better at these sorts of
  things than any other Tradition.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Matter - The Path of Hera
   </b>
   . Hera was charged with
  looking after married women, and a home that is going to provide
  for children needs to have a solid material basis. The roof must
  not leak, the clothes must stay mended, the men need a place to
  keep their stuff. Hera gives the Willworker knowledge of these
  secrets and more.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Mind - The Path of Thoth
   </b>
   . Thoth was the scribe of the
  Gods and recorder of spells. As such, He was able to learn much
  about the operation of the mind and how to weigh a person's heart
  in addition to other things he keeps as his secrets.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Prime - The Path of Gaia
   </b>
   . Gaia makes up most of Nature.
  It is the ground beneath our feet and the ground from which
  Magick flows as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Spirit - The Path of Osiris
   </b>
   . Osiris became the ruler of
  the spirit world after his death by dismemberment. He has much to
  teach, but just as he did not come by his position easily, so
  this path is not without peril.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Time - The Path of Odin and the Fates
   </b>
   . Odin sacrificed
  his eye in order to gain visions of the future. The Fates are
  always at the their loom, weaving the destiny of all. By working
  in partnership with them, the Willworker will learn their powers,
  and doubtless someday pay the price for them.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Mage Backgrounds
  </h3>
  <p>
   <b>
    Arcane - The Crone's Cloak
   </b>
   . The Crone will sometimes
  lend her Cloak to shield the Willworker from the prying eyes of a
  cold world.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Avatar - Inner Self
   </b>
   . This is another part of the self.
  It bears watching and talking to just like any other part of
  Nature. Willworkers that are more closely connected to it for
  some reason tend to be closer to Nature. It is certain that this
  Mystery lies at the heart of the quest for Ascension.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Destiny - Destiny, Doom, Wyrd
   </b>
   . Some rivers are bigger
  than others. Some storms are bigger than others. Some Willworkers
  are fated for more than others.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Dream - The Cauldron of Ceridwen
   </b>
   . By making certain
  preparations (usually involving a cauldron), the Willworker can
  gain access to the Cauldron of Inspiration itself and gain
  knowledge and skills not previously possessed.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Node - Sacred Grove, Place of Power
   </b>
   . Verbena tend to
  prepare Sacred Groves of oak trees as their places of power,
  though sometimes a garden will have to do in these corrupted
  times. Verbena also know that other Traditions prepare other
  places that have power. Nature Herself sometimes designates a
  place as having power (because they are close to the Heart of
  Nature, apparently).
