   <h2>
    Theurgy among the Traditions
   </h2>
   What is Thaumaturgy and
  Theurgy? Both are types of magick, but done for different
  purposes. Thaumaturgy, practical magick, is the type of magick
  described in most detail in Mage. It effects changes in the
  physical or magickal world. These effects are often quite
  specific, like turning lead into gold, healing somebody or create
  a talisman. Thaumaturgic magick is quite independent of
  tradition. While the means may differ, most mages could do the
  same things given sufficient knowledge and power.
   <p>
    Theurgic magick on the other hand has seldom a clearly
  specified goal. Its purpose is purely spiritual, to move the
  mage, his tradition or the whole world towards Ascension. There
  is seldom a obvious result. While thaumaturgy creates effects in
  the lower planes, the goal with theurgic magick is to rise above
  them. In a way it could be called "religious magick". It differs
  greatly among the traditions, who all have different views on
  what Ascension is and what theurgy to perform for its
  celebration.
   </p>
   <p>
    I think there should have been more mention in the
  descriptions of the Traditions of how the theurgy works for each
  tradition. It is an extremely important form of magick, and many
  mages may even say it is far more important than thaumaturgy.
  Magick isn't just how to cast a fireball, it is a vital
  philosophy for every mage. Theurgy ties the mage more closely to
  the power of his or her tradition, and its spheres. (The extra
  power a mage receives in the tradition-specific sphere may be
  closely tied to the theurgy of the tradition) I have written some
  of my ideas about the theurgy in different traditions. Feel free
  to comment.

     The Brotherhood strives towards enlightenment with
  Do. This may be done in many ways, ranging from monastic
  seclusion to the perfection of martial arts. The tradition is
  both highly individualistic, stressing the value and importance
  of each human, and collective, stressing the importance of
  harmony and coperation between everybody. Each human must learn
  to control his own mind and thus all aspects of himself.
     <p>
      Do is the theurgy of the Brotherhood. By meditating,
  performing katas or just living along the lines of Do, the
  brothers try to balance their minds. Everything should be under
  control, yet free. Exactly how this balancing is done varies
  between sub-traditions and different brothers. Some spend much
  time meditating, studying their own thoughts and emotions. Others
  try to embody Do through daily life. Even opening a door can be a
  part of Do. More martially inclined brothers perform katas, Tai
  Chi or try to perfect their combat style in other ways. Some
  brothers try to solve koan-like riddles. And some brothers try to
  balance themselves through not trying to balance themselves. The
  important thing about Do is its pervasiveness. Everything can be
  a part of the Do, if done correctly.
     </p>
     <p>
      The purpose of Do is to gain completely control of their
  minds. Learning to control the body or a martial art will give
  the brother help to learn how to control his mind. When a brother
  has mastered one aspect of Do, he must begin mastering another
  aspect. When a brother masters something, he learns about
  himself. And when a brother learns to control his mind, he learns
  to control his body and physical world. When a mage have balanced
  himself completely, his full potential is realised. The control
  must not be forced, and ideally it would be completely
  subconscious.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Brotherhood seems to avoid much outward ceremonies. The
  celebrations and rites they perform are a part of Do, but not the
  individual Do of a brother but of the whole brotherhood. The
  whole brotherhood must try to achieve a similar perfect balance
  between its parts. By becoming a living embodiment of Do, a
  brother may show others the Way. By becoming an embodiment of Do,
  the Brotherhood may show society the Way.

     The chorus is mainly interested in theurgy, and tend
  to disdain thaumaturgy. Their main theurgy is quite like the
  Christian theurgy (which they have partially created).
     <p>
      On Saturdays the Masses are held, wherein the choristers and
  their acolytes solemnly sings together in prayer to the eternal
  glory of the One. The priest (generally the highest ranking
  chorist present) leads the choir, and preaches the Word. He also
  lights the pure fire on the altar in front of the congregation
  under prayer. They receive the Eucharist of Fire, wherein each
  celebrant go forth to the great fire on the altar, cup their
  hands inside and drink the fire. Miraculously, nobody with the
  true belief has ever been hurt by the pure fire. This Eucharist
  will burn out all impurities in the celebrant and fill them with
  the power of the One.
     </p>
     <p>
      During week nights, smaller observances are held, where
  smaller groups of choristers and their acolytes meet to pray and
  sing together and listen to parts of the holy texts. These
  meetings are not much unlike prayer meetings in countless other
  religions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each chorist is recommended to perform the four daily
  adorations to the sun in addition to any other prayers (Aleister
  Crowley tried to profane them by turning them into prayers to
  Egyptian gods and publishing them in his Liber Resh vel Helios).
  These adorations are held at dawn, midday, sunset and midnight.
  The chorist stands before the sun, holding the sun-symbol and
  fire, intoning in a loud voice:
     </p>
     <p class="c1">
      At dawn:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      "Hail unto Thee who art The One in Thy rising, even unto thee
    who art The One in Thy Strength, Who travelest over the heavens
    on the Eagle of Light at the uprising of the Sun. Mercy

     The cultists spontaneously decide to hold ceremonies
  when there are enough members around. These ceremonies celebrate
  the pure Joy of existence, by any imaginable means. Cultists and
  acolytes erupt into spontaneous choirs singing the praise of
  beauty. Others drink to life and pleasure. Members try to bring
  each others to the highest ecstasy by sex, drugs and music.
  Magick is used to prolong and intensify the experience as much as
  possible.
     <p>
      A onlooker will have a hard time realising that it is a
  theurgic ritual, since it looks as a wild party. Still, while the
  participants become lost in their pleasure the original goal
  persists: to celebrate the Ecstasy of Being, and to try to spread
  it to everybody else. The western cultists are much more
  extrovert than the eastern groups, and tend to use excess in any
  form in the theurgy. Many of the cultists in the Orient use
  subtle, sensual means to celebrate, slowly building the power.
  They dislike unnecessary excesses, and prefer to focus their
  power. Sometimes they select a few participants, and turn them
  into gods. The participants invoke known gods (Indra and Shakti
  are most popular among Tantrics), or invoke themselves. The
  others do everything to please and pleasure the gods, very slowly
  building the power until it is released in a powerful
  eruption.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many cultists perform small ceremonies when they feel for it.
  It could be anything, ranging from a cool glass of beer and a
  moments quit contemplation to a spontaneous outburst of song and
  music in the subway to cheer up the sleepers. The important thing
  is not what the cultist do, it is that it is fun and done with
  the Ascension in mind.

     <h2>

       Dreamspeakers
      </a>
     </h2>
     Dreamspeakers revere the
  spirits of the ancestors, of nature and of the higher realms.
  They seek to gain more contact with the spirit world and bring it
  closer. How this is done varies between different cultures and
  tribes. The most important means are shamanic methods to enter
  trance states like intoxication, drumming, dancing or dreaming.
  This is done individually to gain insight into the wisdom of the
  spirits, who will show the dreamspeaker the true reality. Long
  travels in the spirit realms is an important part of the life of
  a dreamspeaker.
     <p>
      A typical dreamspeaker ritual may consist of first drawing the
  symbols of the spirit world in sand around himself, and then to
  dance, drum and sing until the mage drops of exhaustion. In the
  following trance the dreamspeaker will be led by his Totem, an
  ancestor or another guiding spirit out into the spirit world. The
  spirits will test him to see if he is worthy, and if he passes
  their tests, they will reveal their secret wisdom.
     </p>
     <p>
      In many societies shamans have had a practical role besides
  their mystical role, as healers and protectors of the traditions.
  They do not only have obligations to the spirits, but also to
  their tribe. An important part of their theurgy have been to
  intercede between the spiritual and material world. But as the
  old ways are swept aside by the technomancers, the Dreamspeakers
  have lost an important part of their world. The connection
  between the spirit world and the mundane world is broken, and
  must be restored. Many dreamspeakers have lost their balance
  completely due to this imbalance.

     The most common theurgic rite is the Good Death. How
  this is done wary quite a bit between individual Euthanatei. Some
  prefer to strike quickly and painlessly, without any warning.
  Others prefer to do it slowly, while they are explaining what is
  happening and praying for the victim. And some Euthanatei prepare
  their victim months in advance, and slowly build up towards the
  moment of the Good Death. They can spend much time just to create
  the exactly right setting and feeling, often giving much thought
  to the exact way the victim dies and how it will feel.
     <p>
      Another important part of the theurgy is to help others to
  live their lives to the fullest. This may also be done in many
  ways, with great individual differences. Some "adopt" people,
  follow them and try to discreetly help them in the right
  direction. Certain Euthanatei have followed a family in
  generations. Others just walk around, helping anybody they feel
  deserves it. Still others engage in humanitarian projects (or
  rather, in what they feel is humanitarian. This may not be what
  anybody else agrees with.)
     </p>
     <p>
      In general, the Euthanatos dislike fixed rituals and
  ceremonies, preferring to use their common sense and intuition.
  They are almost always concerned with individual people and
  practical things in their theurgy, unlike the other traditions.
  The Euthanatos feel that their work is leading mankind forward
  directly.

     Order of Hermes has developed a elaborate theurgy
  over they years. Different sub-traditions have very different
  variants, but in general the goal of the theurgy is wisdom and
  knowledge. The complex rituals are meant to balance the forces of
  the universe, to reaffirm the mages dedication to the Great Work
  and to gain insight in the secrets of magick.
     <p>
      The ceremonies which are held wary in importance, ranging from
  small ceremonies on ordinary weekdays to the complex and powerful
  equinox meetings. The more important the date is, or the
  conjunctions present, the more complex ceremony. These rites are
  meant to attune the mages and their order to the forces of the
  planets and fixed stars. In many of these rites the mages will
  try to link the terrestrial forces with the spiritual forces,
  thus bringing the world closer to the higher planes.
     </p>
     <p>
      The ceremonies can be elaborate rituals involving dozens of
  participants, complex incantations and powerful magick. They can
  also be peaceful group meditations on the subject of the
  ceremony. Note that this may be very powerful too, in a more
  subtle way. When a group of mages think about something in about
  the same way the same time, reality may begin to change. Many
  hermetic groups collaborate in their rituals, performing the same
  rituals at the same time to tie the order closer together and
  gain more power.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are many small, daily rituals most members perform. Many
  mages perform a banishing ritual in the morning and in the
  evening, or even more often. The Lesser Banishing ritual of the
  Pentagram is most commonly used, sometimes combined with the
  Banishing Ritual of the Hexagram. The Middle Pillar Ritual is
  used to gain more power, and connect more deeply with the
  universe. The four adorations (see the Celestial Chorus) are
  sometimes used.
     </p>
     <p>
      Initiations are very important. They do not only signify the
  recognition and ability of the initiate, but also his progression
  towards Ascension. Each initiation embodies a new secret level of
  existence the initiate is confronted with. As one hermetic said,
  "Initiation never ends" and "Every day is an Initiation". Much of
  the theurgy of Order of Hermes revolve about the initiations (and
  quite a bit of politics).
     </p>
     <p>
      The exact initiation rites varies quite a bit. Among the
  mainstream of the order, the ritual is filled with heavy
  symbolism and sometimes hard tests. The candidate must overcome
  all obstacles to progress towards new heights. A typical
  initiation at a low level may work as follows in a
  Rosicrucian-derived group:
     </p>
     <p>
      The candidate, wearing a black robe over a white robe
  (signifying the truth hidden beneath the veil of ignorance) is
  bound with a cord three times and hoodwinked. He is led into the
  temple, wherein there are several officers of the ritual,
  signifying the different forces of the universe. The presiding
  officer, the Hegemon ceremonially opens the temple ("After
  sealing the material barriers, let us now evoke the forces of the
  elements. Are the forces of Fire evoked duly in the South, frater
  Daudachos?", "Yes, they are duly evoked honoured Hegemon.", "Are
  the forces of Water evoked duly in the West, frater Stolistes?"
  and so on...).
     </p>
     <p>
      After the opening the temple, he states the purpose of the
  ritual ("This temple have been duly opened to witness the
  initiation of XXX..."), and asks the candidate why he want to
  become initiated to the next grade, if he thinks he is
  knowledgeable enough, if he thinks he is powerful enough, if he
  thinks he is wise enough, if he thinks he is worthy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Having got acceptable responses he asks several other
  philosophical questions ("Why are there four elements?", "What
  force is stronger than all other forces together?", "What is the
  secret meaning of the Hexagram?" "What is the first duty of a
  Zelator?"). Hearing the unacceptable answers, he proclaims "Thou
  art yet a child of the Darkness. Thou cannot pass through the
  gates of the East until thou hast been purified!". The candidate
  is led around the temple to the officers at different stations,
  and is purified and instructed in the secrets of the grade. After
  passing one or more circuits the binding cord is removed, as he
  have gained his power and knowledge. A complex prayer explaining
  deep secrets about the universe is read by the Hegemon and other
  officers, and the candidate repeats after them.
     </p>
     <p>
      Suddenly the hoodwink of the candidate is removed, and he
  looks at the secret symbol of the grade on the altar. Suddenly
  the hidden logic of the new grade dawns on him, and his black
  robe is removed to signify his enlightenment. The Hegemon repeats
  the questions, which the candidate now answers correctly. The
  whiterobed candidate now swears a solemn oath to never reveal
  these secrets to the unworthy, to use them wisely and to continue
  the Great Work. The Hegemon greets the initiate with a speech.
  Finally the temple is closed, and the mages depart (often to
  celebrate the initiation).
     </p>
     <p>
      The Cabalists theurgy is quite religious. They spend much of
  their time studying the Torah and other holy texts, praying and
  performing devotional rituals celebrating the divine wisdom of
  the Lord. They have influenced many of the ceremonies of the
  other groups, and often participate.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Enochians perform complex ceremonies to strengthen their
  temples to build up the power they think will be needed to bring
  about the Great Plan of the Highest. Much time is spent
  conversing with the Angels, who will give instructions, power and
  most important, insight into the Great Plan.
     </p>
     <p>
      Alchemists idea of theurgy is quite different. They spend much
  time in devising complex and time-consuming experiments, where
  they perform utterly subtle manipulations of matter. These
  manipulations, they believe, will also change the experimenter
  and show how nature will evolve. The more complex, the more
  expensive and the more time-consuming the experiment is, the more
  power. Some alchemists have kept fires burning for centuries,
  distilling ordinary fire into something extremely pure. Others
  have split plants and animals into their essential salts,
  purified these and allowed them to react, trying to distil the
  essence of the original life-form. Each experiment will in some
  sense also influence the alchemist, evolving him to higher
  levels. Their Great Work consists of creating the Red Stone, the
  Philosophers Stone (not necessarily a physical substance, but
  most alchemists believe it will be both physical, mental and
  spiritual).

     Central to Verbena theurgy is the link to Life.
  Almost all Verbena theurgy seeks to strengthen the link between
  the mage, coven or mankind with the Great Life Force. This force
  is sometimes represented as Baphomet, The Sabbath goat with a
  thousand young, filled with life. Other groups prefer to use the
  Trinal Goddess in her different forms (The Maid, The Mother and
  The Crone). These beings may be anthropomorphic personifications
  of Life (and Death) or celestines.
     <p>
      At the Sabbaths the coven meet to reaffirm their duty and to
  strengthen the link to Life. Exactly how this is done varies a
  bit with sub-tradition. In many covens the rite is begun by the
  participants dancing around the World Tree, chanting and raising
  the cone of power. This is done faster and faster. Sometimes the
  Priestess and/or Priest allow themselves to be possessed with the
  Goddess and God. During the rite, sacrifices are made to
  strengthen the link, energy is channelled into the world tree and
  oaths are made. In some covens the participants engage in ritual
  sex to release even more energy, and balance the sacrifices.
     </p>
     <p>
      The mages may perform other rites on other days, to strengthen
  themselves. These may be almost anything: sacrificing some fruit
  or meat to nature, tending to a sick lifeform or running wildly
  scyclad through the forest, feeling the life around themselves,
  freeing themselves from the chains of civilisation, mind and
  self-control. The most important thing is the link between the
  mage and the living world, and to avoid getting trapped in the
  lifeless technomancer reality.

     Unlike the other traditions, the Virtual Adepts
  seems to be quite prosaic on the surface. Their goal seems
  completely materialistic in the beginning. But they have also
  their theurgy, albeit much different from the other traditions.
  It is quite practical, as should be expected from technomancers.
  The Virtual Adept idea of Ascension, the Singularity, is
  transhumanistic. They want to merge with the information and
  become far more than humans. They will turn cyberspace into
  something more real than static reality, where mankind can upload
  itself into the eternal Network and transcend every limitation.
  This is mostly celebrated through intense, imaginative
  discussions where ideas and plans flow, discussing how to achieve
  different sub-goals and what to do in the microsecond before the
  Singularity.
     <p>
      The Singularity is celebrated by the adepts through the
  creation of ever more complex and elegant systems. What the
  systems do is often unimportant, the important thing is the fact
  that they are "hackish". The virtual chantry realm is a monument
  to the Singularity. Inside the adepts do their best to create
  ever more beautiful creations to bring about It. What the adepts
  create do not have to be software, it could be anything as long
  it emulates a part of the Singularity and shows the way towards
  It.
