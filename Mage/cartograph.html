     To Mr. Copperfield, David
     <br>
      <br>
       My acquaintances in the media have furnished me with a programme
  of your upcoming Bermuda Triangle conjure-show. They have
  determined its content to be objectionable and in all probability
  will prevent its airing. While I personally applaud your efforts
  as a performer, I support the judgement of my collegues; fancy
  and and spectacles are well and good, but you must not be allowed
  to disseminate these grevious factual errors.
       <br>
        <br>
         First and foremost, the Burmuda Occult Array is not an
  equilateral triangle. In using an equilateral structure for your
  "pyramid magic," you will not achieve any sort of
  geometric-harmonic relationship. A scalene pyramid base will
  yield better results. Secondly, "pyramid magic" would require a
  three-dimensional array, congruent to the scaled pyramid featured
  in your programme. The Bermuda Occult Array is two-dimensional.
  An object such as a helicoptor, weather balloon, or in a pinch a
  celestial body could serve as the crucial fourth point. Be
  certain to scale your model pyramid appropriately.
         <br>
          <br>
           Lastly, your plan to stage teleportation in this pyramid
  structure mystifies me. I have seen pyramids used to sharpen
  razors, heal the wounded and alter the flow of time. As the
  pyramid structure acts as a focus for energy, using such a device
  in your performance would be self-defeating. I suggest a more
  aggressive structure; stellated polyhedrons contain the
  projective elements you require.
           <br>
            <br>
             May this letter find you in good health,
             <br>

     The League of
  Cartographers
    </span>
   </b>
  </p>
  <p>
   Since its founding, the Convention of the Void Engineers has
  thoroughly explored every crevasse of both land and ocean. Only
  recently have they left this tiny realm to map the infinitely
  wider horizons of space and the Umbra. From their first voyages
  the League of Cartographers aided the Void Engineers in mapping
  and closing the possibilities of the earth. Early Cartographers
  served as acolytes to the Engineers, unawakened mapmakers who
  made concrete what the Engineers "discovered." Over a period of
  centuries the League of Cartographers carefully erased every
  "Here There Be Dragons" on their globes.
  </p>
  <p>
   When the Void Engineers turned their focus from the physical
  world to the shifting realms of Deep Space and Deep Umbra, they
  left their tools in the hands of the Cartographers. Still charged
  with their mission of exploration, the Cartographers sought out
  those few sites which were not easily defined. Continued rumors
  of disappearances in the Bermuda Triangle, an obsession with the
  legendary sunken continent of Atlantis, and patterns of
  unexplained occurrences at hundreds of scattered sites eluded
  their best efforts at explanation.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1914 Julianne Thetford journeyed to Arabia, commissioned to
  bring information on a ring of nine equally spaced points in the
  Rub al Khali desert. Over the past three decades reports of
  angelic beings had filtered from these points, possibly a result
  of a previously unknown mirage phenomenon. Thetford returned a
  changed woman, vibrant and wide-eyed. She spoke of meeting with
  an Arab, a proud man who danced and sung and explained all the
  mysteries to her. He spoke of a "web of faith," of ley lines, of
  patterns of something called "quintessence," of metaphysical
  geometry, and above all of a site called Qaf. She
   <br>
    brought parchments of complicated spiralling designs, polyhedrons
  created from numeric ratios not usually applied to geography.
  Overlaying these parchments with transparent maps, modern and
  ancient ones still bearing the legend "Here There Be Dragons,"
  the mysterious world suddenly made sense. The core of the League
  of Cartographers Awakened.
   </br>
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite their mystical tendancies, the bulk of the League of
  Cartographers swears devotion to the Technocratic Union. Their
  aid in locating nodes and Garou Caerns has been invaluable in the
  Ascension War. Yet every year, one or two of the Awakened
  mapmakers defects to the side of the Mystics, invariably joining
  forces with the Dreamspeakers, Hermetics or the Al-i-Batin. They
  are only rarely recovered.
  </p>
  <p>
   The new generation of Cartographers has learned to manipulate
  flows of Quintessence by means of complicated geometric theories.
  They take notes on the positions of the moons and planets,
  observing the effects of planetary alignments on the paths of Ley
  Lines and magickal phenomena. A few of the younger members of the
  League have lobbied to rename the convention "The
  Conjunctionists," shifting the view of the League from the earth
  to the sky. This proposition is continually voted down at each
  Symposium, but is gaining popularity.

       Look here, and here, and here. Don't you see? The angles and
  curves of the Quintessence Tectonic flow-chart indicate buildups
  which we could use to our advantage. Simply stand between the two
  trees on the boulder between the two and try the Alpha Invocation
  Posture. Our colleagues say there is no magick in the world. They
  simply do not know how to look. It's everywhere, a mesh of
  currents like underground streams. That boulder is as an artesian
  spring -- no, stay there! We can divert
       <br>
        these flows with our methodology. There's something to what the
  Traditionals say. Magick is wild and free. Our maps and
  calculations can control it. Now, if we mark out the edges of a
  Buckminster Dome, we should be able to harness the local flow
  with only a minimal danger of your exploding. Ready?

           <br>
            As a Technocratic Convention, the League of Cartographers are
  subordinate first to the Void Engineers, and secondly to the
  Technocracy as a whole. Both within and without the Technocracy
  the relatively few members of the League exist in a
  non-hierarchical society of equals, working alone or in tandem as
  necessary. Members of the League are not hostile to those members
  who have defected; Conjunctionists on the side of the Mystics are
  friendly toward their former collegues, though they see them as
  deluded. Both factions have a strong need for leading bodies,
  either the Conventions or the Council of Nine, as
  appropriate.

     The League of Cartographers meet in the Technocracy's monthly
  symposiums to discuss their agendas. Mystical Cartographers do
  not meet regularly, though they communicate between cabals via a
  rote known as "point-node focusing."

         Particularly talented Sleeper geographers and geometrists are
  brought into the outer circle of the League. They are gradually
  exposed to the more unusual aspects of exploration that
  confounded the League in its formative phase; if the prospective
  member becomes properly obsessed by the problems presented they
  are given the lessons taught to Julianne Thetford decades ago.
  The solitary Mystic Conjunctionists will occasionally mentor
  promising candidates on their own, but do not have an established
  ceremony.

   Technomantic and Mystic Cartomancers differ in their
  perceptions of "foci." The Technomancers follow the "Arete 5"
  rule for dropping Foci, as they operate primarily on faith in
  their Methodology. The Mystics -- those who acknowledge that
  there is magick in the world -- may drop foci beginning at Arete
  2, as Verbena, Dreamspeakers and so forth may
   <br>
    do. The player should make this decision at character creation.
  If the Cartographer changes "paths" over the course of a
  Chronical, he may begin "dropping" Foci at 2/Arete increase, as
  per the Tradition's Technomancers, until he has caught up with
  the Mystics if the Storyteller so desires.
    <br>
     <br>
      Technomantic and Mystic is a state of mind, not a state of
  allegience. A Cartographer who believes in the power of
  Technology and Order may -still- work with the Traditions, if
  they'll have him...

         Arrangement
        </span>
        : Careful geometric
  arrangement of rocks, wires, traffic patterns and so forth aid
  the Cartographer in focusing Quintessential energy. It takes only
  seconds to throw magnets in six different directions, perhaps
  weeks to arrange a spiral of sheet plastic across a mile-wide
  region, and no time at all to use the geometric structure of The
  Pentagon. Makeshift arrangements without proper measurement
  increase the difficulty of an effect by 1. Large undertakings or
  magickal effects attempted in well-established geometric
  arrangements like the aforementioned Pentagon may result in more
  dramatic successes. Arrangement is a common focus in Prime and
  Correspondence magick.

         The Cartographer's Technocratic masters frown upon this rote; its
  coincidental nature relies on truly cutting-edge geometry and
  physics, studies which are beyond the ken of even the most
  insightful members of Iteration X. Careful reversal of the
  quantum formulae which demonstrate the formation of a black hole
  show that in a logical universe point-node focusing is
  theoretically possible, yet many doubt the existence of black
  holes themselves.

   Use of this rote creates minute bubbles of geometric area,
  tiny pin-prick expansions of the time-space continuum. At present
  the Cartographers have succeeded in creating space-pockets on the
  subatomic scale, though expansion to the molecular level is
  forseen. These expansions of time-space collapse almost
  instantaneously, with no effect on reality as a whole; the
  ripples created by the mage's manipulations carry over an
  incredible distance, and can be used as a sort of telegraph by
  those with Correspondence Sense.
   <br>
    <br>
     <i>
      Prime and Correspondence allow the creation of tiny pockets of
  mathematical space. Mind 1 grants the mage the ability to send
  and receive messages via a three-dimensional analog of morse code
  -- receiving the messages requires only Correspondence 2. The
  range at which the mage's fluctuations may be detected equals the
  cube of the caster's successes, expressed in miles. Sophisticated
  computer Talismans can detect such fluctuations over an
  effectively unlimited range.. The receiving mage must be aware of
  the sending mage's "transmissions" to successfully understand
  them -- the Mind-based encoding used in point-node focusing is
  quite alien to normal thought-processes.

       Careful alignment of widely separate objects is an essential
  element in Cartographer magick. In a pinch, this Rote can be used
  to force such arrangements. Using an effect similer to Hermes'
  Portal, the Cartographer can create windows in space to create
  the illusion of arrangement in a straight line. Through the use
  of this rote the mage may wound five different targets with the
  same bullet or play a game of tug-of-war in three cities at
  once.
       <br>
        <br>
         <i>
          This effect relies on Conjoin Localities to align diverse
  objects. Successes determine the range of the effects -- refer to
  the Correspondence Range Chart -- or the number of gates created.
  Thus, three successes can align two objects which are "very
  familiar" to the mage by creating a single gate and augmenting
  the effect's range, or align three objects which are within the
  mage's field of view by creating two gates. At least two
  successes must be scored to successfully cast this rote.

           Thetford herself first used this rote to disable the Silver Moon
  Chantry in Yellowstone Park. She placed stakes in the ground at
  regular intervals, creating a decagram around the Chantry, tying
  them together with copper wire at the precise moment of high
  noon. The flow of raw Quintessence into their only node was
  chaotically scattered into the surrounding area, and the Chantry
  lost their source of energy. After that, it was only a matter of
  time before the cabal of Dreamspeakers was overpowered.

            <br>
             <i>
              The Mage uses Channel Quintessence and Diffuse Energy to
  disrupt the flow of raw Quintessence into a Node or through a Ley
  Line. One success will maintain the rote for a single day. Three
  successes will maintain for a full month, and five successes
  render the effect permanent. A good portion of the Quintessence
  diverted is used to empower the rote, and the effect is very
  vulnerable to antimagick. Attempts to disrupt this spell gain a
  -2 bonus to their difficulties.
