   The Angel of Pain
  </h1>
  <i>
   by Anders Sandberg

  <p>
   In the high Umbra all kinds of concepts exist in manifested
  form, emanations from the minds of the Aeons. Some are beautiful,
  others terrible, but they all have a purity of existence
  impossible to understand by mortals. Except perhaps one, the
  Angel of Pain.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Angel looks completely human - except for that it lacks
  skin, its glistening organs are clearly visible and some of its
  tendons have been severed so that all muscles hang freely from
  its body. The loose muscles (which do not bleed) serenely drift
  around its body like a seaweed in the ocean, red veils of agony.
  All its movements are slow and graceful, as it floats
  weightlessly a foot above the ground.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Angel is the manifestation of pure pain. Everyone in its
  vicinity feels its presence, not as pain but as potential pain;
  as if a sharp knife moved a hairsbreadth above the skin, ready to
  cut a deep gash. Anybody who touches the Angel, either physically
  or magickally, immediately is paralysed by agonising pain. The
  pain is far beyond anything normally experienced by mortal flesh,
  it is the essence of anguish magnified a thousandfold. In some
  rare cases the Angel has kissed a mortal, who has been
  ²blessed² with total agony for the rest of his or her
  (usually short) life.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Angel seems to be an independent being, not serving any
  power other than itself. It doesn¹t care about the affairs
  of mortals or their wishes, and it doesn¹t strive to extend
  its pain to others - maybe there is enough pain in the world
  already. It never speaks or tries to communicate. In fact, the
  Angel seems almost serene, and a few mages have argued that if
  one could only accept it and reach the same mental harmony its
  touch would no longer be agony but ecstasy and tranquillity
  united.
  </p>
  <hr>
   [Any contact with the Angel, through touch, magick or through a
  tool (Like a sword hitting it or a gunshot) will cause agony in
  the human. The important thing isn¹t physical connection but
  the fact that the person seeks contact with the being, a thrown
  rock will be just as painful as a direct touch.
   <p>
    The pain is not physical but mental. Mages with Mind can
  counteract it using their Arete against a difficulty of 8 to
  reduce the pain of the Angel. It has 5 dices of pain initially if
  the mage just touches it, and 8 dices if it deliberately reaches
  out and embraces the mage. Some rotes can also build up a mental
  barrier before touching the Angel, they also reduce the number of
  dices.
   </p>
   <p>
    To be able to act at all while in total agony, the victim has
  to succeed with his Willpower against a difficulty equal to the
  remaining pain dices plus four. A botch means the victim has been
  completely overcome with pain and cannot do anything until it
  ends; a multiple botch might lead to a permanent phobia against
  all painful stimuli. If the victim succeeds in steeling his will
  and act, his dicepool is reduced by the remaining dices of the
  Angel.
   </p>
   <p>
    After being touched, the pain will gradually subside with one
  step per turn, until the victim is painless again (if it has not
  been touched by the Angel in the meantime, of course). However,
  if the angel kisses a victim on the mouth (which requires it to
  hold him in its arms) it can insert a fragment of its being into
  the very soul of the victim. The resulting pain will never go
  away until the soul is cleansed - somehow.]
