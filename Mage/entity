   A Short Excursion into Cosmology (If anyone wants to archive this, feel
free).

   [One] [Day] [In] what might very loosely be described as the Quintessential
Chaos, there *WERE* [Several] [Entities].
   (It will be noted that [] indicates a rough translation, but ** indicates
something that definitely is true)
   (Maybe)

[First] [Entity]: *I'M* bored.
[Second] [Entity]: [You're] bored ? How do [you] [think] *I* [feel] ?
1E: *I* know, let's invent [Numbers]
2E: [Numbers] ?
1E: Yeah ! <ZAP> Numbers !
2E: Cool ! Hey, I'm [no longer] talking to myself.
1E: I [noticed] that.
Third Entity: So [did] I.
1E: Hey, who are you ? And what [happened] to using *I* and [you] ?
3E: The way I [figure] it, we [just] [started] creating Reality and 
     Identity. Neat, huh ?
2E: Ahah ! So that's [where] we all [came from] ! There's one, two...
     um, lots and lots of us, isn't there ?
1E: But there was only One [before], right ?
3E: [When] ?
1E: [Before].
3E: [When] ?
1E: [Be -] [Fuck] it <ZAP> Before !!
3E: Oh, right, before !!
2E: And we're [in] After, Now, right ?
1E: No [Shit], Sherlock. I'll call it - Time !
2E: Cute. What do we do now ?
3E: No [idea].
2E: What ?
3E: No [idea].
2E: What ?
3E: Let's not do this again. <ZAP> No id - Hey, plenty of ideas !!
2E: Yeah ! Great ! What'll you call it ?
3E: Mind, I think. Lessee...
1E: [People], if we're seperate, we better have some way to distinguish
     ourselves.
2E: We could call ourselves different names.
1E: Not good enough. I mean, if I suddenly called myself [Fourth Entity] or
     [Fifth Entity], how would you tell the difference ?
4E: Yeah !
5E: Where did you [come from] ?
4E: No, where did you [come from] ?
5E: 1, watch it with this naming bit, ok ?
1E: Right. What we need is some way to distinguish [between] us.
5E: What ?
1E: Distinguish [bet -]. What is it, am I surrounded by morons [here] ?
     <ZAP> Between us !! Better ?
4E: Hey, cool ! What is it ?
1E: Space. The Final Frontier.
4E: What makes you say that ?
1E: I'm not sure. Seemed like the right thing to say at the time.
3E: I have a [brilliant] idea ! [MATTER] ! <FIZZLE>
2E: Oops.
3E: It should have worked.
4E: 's too chaotic.
3E: What ?
4E: You need rules. I mean, it was all floating around the place, and it
     didn't cohere.
3E: Oh, so I need something to make it cohere ?
4E: Not just that. You need to make rules to make it slippery, and rules
     to make it take up room, and rules to make it move around. You need
     lots of rules. And it'll need to be linked in with something else.
2E: [Energy] ?
4E: That's it !
5E: I can see this is going to take a bit of time...

{MUCH later}

{*BZZZZZT* You have reached Mythology Central. I am afraid that there is
  no one in the office right now, since all of our staff are out screwing
  around as Avatars or Cosmic Forces. If you'd care to leave your name and
  number, we'll get back to you shortly after the Apocolypse. Thank you,
  and have a nice [day]*)

?E: Fuck. Let there be [LIGHT] !
