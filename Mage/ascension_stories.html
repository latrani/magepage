    Okay, after the recent discussions about the
  Ascension War, et al, I guess it's time to describe some of the
  best ideas you could get from the Cold War view of the Ascension
  War.
   </p>
   <hr class="c5">

      Stories

    </b>
    <p>
     Sometimes you need a one-shot, either as a lead in, an
  introduction, or even a way to get a matrix or open Chronicle
  moving. Or maybe you're in an established Chronicle, and need an
  idea for where to send the characters THIS week. Or maybe you
  need a nice finale, a set piece to close a Chronicle and open
  into the next one. There are a LOT of scenarios that can be
  created on a moment's notice that fit well into the Cold War
  collection.
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
     <span class="c7">
      Bodyguard
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     One of the simplest scenarios known to man, the characters are
  asked/forced/volunteer(ed) to protect a key figure of their own
  "side" that has been targetted by the opposition. This could be a
  half-hearted "Oh yeah, if you find him, try to hurt him" to a
  full-out running firefight with lots of flashing lights and
  Vulgar magic. The characters may be assigned to the person
  indefinitely, or as a stopgap, or maybe to cover during the most
  dangerous stretch.
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
     <span class="c7">
      Search and Destroy
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Another simple scenario, the cabal has to get in, destroy, and
  get out. For a twist, they may not know where they are supposed
  to go, or the details. This could be a surgical, precision
  military operation with guards and stakeouts and information
  gathering, or it could be an ad hoc operation against something
  that has just been discovered. The main emphasis, like on the
  Bodyguard mission above, may well be on combat, but not
  necessarilly. Sometimes getting there is more than half the
  battle.
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
     <span class="c7">
      Assassinate
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Like the Search and Destroy mission, this one is mostly
  military, but with a twist. THey have a moving, live target, a
  spy, a major figure, or maybe a researcher who's been a nuisance
  and geting too close. This person could be Awakened or not,
  public figure or private, and there may be mundane as well as
  magical resistance and repercussions. The twist is, of course,
  that the characters are working under false assumptions, and end
  up discovering this through the course of the Story.
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
     <span class="c7">
      Coming in From the Cold
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Defection. The stuff spy stories are made of. A high level
  insider from another faction wishes to defect, and must be found
  (not as simple as getting in a boat and floating through
  international waters, folx), identified, protected, brought home,
  and then interrogated. Conversely, they may be called in to
  prevent a defection from occurring, by any means necessary.
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
     <span class="c7">
      The Mole
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     The characters learn of (or are told of) a mole within their
  own faction. They have to find this individual, and neutralize
  him, whether that means simply reporting him to the Elders or
  "liquidating" him. The flip side of this coin is, of course,
  trying to convince a member of another faction to become a mole
  for your side.
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
     <span class="c7">
      Intelligence
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Typical cloak and dagger stuff. The characters must infiltrate
  an organization, gather information, and get out. This could be a
  break-in, a hit and run, or a slow, tedious process of earning
  trust. If they go in both guns blazing, they will probably
  fail.
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
     <span class="c7">
      Agent Provacateur
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     The characters are approached with some rather strong
  information pointing to them actually supporting the wrong side.
  They must verify or refute the information, and deal with the
  consequences of what they discover. This may result in the
  characters actually defecting to one of the other factions, or
  exposing an entire chain of aliances and shifting loyalties
  amongst their own ranks.
    </p>
    <hr class="c5">
     <b>
      <span class="c6">
       Chronicles
      </span>
     </b>
     <p>
      The Ascension War has been going on for centuries, with hot
  and cold flashes as time goes on. THis is the source of any
  number of CHronicle ideas, from beginning to advanced characters
  of nearly any power level. To survive, the characters must know
  when to fight, and know when to sneak in and sneak out.
     </p>
     <p class="c8">
      <span class="c7">
       Initiates
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      The characters start on one of the above scenarios, yet they
  know nothing of the real reason behind what they are doing.
  During the course of successive stories, they discover more ad
  more, until eventually they are at the heart of the Ascension
  War.
     </p>
     <p class="c8">
      <span class="c7">
       The Intelligence
  Community
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      The characters are put in charge of getting information ad
  infiltrating the enemy. They may be called on to occasionally act
  in ways counter to what they may wish, and as time goes on they
  may begin to forget what their original purpose was. They begin
  by infiltrating themselves, maybe wth small robberies and petty
  infiltration, then extending onward to gathering a network of
  moles and informants, to encouraging individuals to defect and
  trying to disable enemy organizations from within. The characters
  may be directly supervised, or have to start pretty much from
  scratch, with only a shadowy contact through which they can
  funnel informaiton. THey may eventually defect themselves, or
  discoer moles in their own organization, or any manner of
  comlicatins and twists
     </p>
     <p class="c8">
      <span class="c7">
       The Mandarin
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      For some reason, the characters have become major players in
  the Ascension War, or they wish to. They must make themselves a
  place amongst the various warring factions, prove their worth,
  and make gains, all while the rest of the world is trying to beat
  them down. They must recruit new members, look for holes in their
  own organizations, and infiltrate and dismantle others.
     </p>
     <p class="c8">
      <span class="c7">
       The Organization/The
  X-Files
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      The characters, in the course of their adventures, begin
  discovering shadowy links between members of all three sides in
  the Ascension War, plus ties to mortal organizations, Vampires,
  Garou, and even the dead and the Umbral Court. They have stumbled
  upon something deeper and darker than they realize: A group of
  beings bent on some unfathomable goal. A secret society among
  secret societies. They first must find more information, then
  they must decide if they wish to ignore it, join it, find out
  more about it or attempt to destroy it. Of course this will make
  them some powerful enemies rather quickly, and just having an
  Arcane of 5 won't hide them for long. Of all the scenarios, this
  is the one that requires the most effort on the part of the
  Storyteller, but can also be the most involving and engaging of
  all the storylines. It may even span multiple Chronicles, and
  involve a literal cast of thousands.
     </p>
     <p class="c8">
      <span class="c7">
       The Conspiracy of Light
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      The characters have learned more than they wanted to know
  about the Ascension War. In fact, they've discovered that the
  sides fighting in it have lost their original purpose, and the
  war is conitnuing for the sake of the war and those who are
  empowered by it. The characters must remove the jaded, entrenched
  people in power on all sides, in an attempt to protect the very
  people the Ascension War is supposed to help: The Sleepers. This
  could eventually result in th characters trying to form a
  super-secret organization of their own, like The Organization,
  above.

        These are some ideas that I found obvious from the talk of the
  Ascension War/Cold War analogies. There are, of course, others,
  but these seem to give a very good feel for how the Ascension War
  would be fought in such a way as to cover hundreds, if not
  thousands of years.

         It is even true of certain ideas, as of certain predatory
  species, that they can subsist only as long as the species of
  idea on which they prey subsists in sufficient number
