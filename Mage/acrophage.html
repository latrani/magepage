   The Acrophage
  </h1>

  <p>
   Many mages are hubris personified, Nietzschean Ãœbermen
  able to warp reality with a single thought. They think they are
  able to Ascend and transform the world. But there are unseen
  dangers on the path towards Ascension, and the Acrophage is one
  of them.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Acrophage is not a paradox spirit, but it and their kind
  share some similarities. The Acrophage is the response of reality
  to hubris, and gain power from trapping mages in their advances.
  Humble mages are ignored, while the quest for Ascension of
  hubristic mages attract its attention.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Acrophage will usually manifest as a beautiful man or
  woman a head taller than the mage, dressed in classical clothes
  (usually brilliant white). An unseen lightsource illuminates the
  Acrophage from above, making its presence both intense and
  overbearing. In the physical world it sometimes manifests on
  television screens or on the phone. Its powers are always similar
  to but greater than the mage; the Acrophage will manifest greater
  forces before a mage who has mastered the lesser forces and
  teleportation before a mage able to just perceive space.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Acrophage seeks out questing mages, and divert them from
  the quest by challenging them and their hubris. Sometimes it
  claims to be the final opponent to be overcome on the quest,
  which is a complete lie. Often the Acrophage simply attacks one
  of the most cherished tenets of the mage's life and starts an
  escalating duel of magick. The only way of defeating the
  Acrophage is to ignore the challenge, but few mages can resist
  trying to defeat the arrogant being. Another method it uses is
  simply to appear during the quest and demonstrate its powers in a
  way the mage feels it has to overshadow in some way. It entices
  newbie Virtual Adepts into battle using "trolls" and "flames",
  making their egos overrule their reason.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Acrophage grows stronger the more the mage fights it, and
  does not care much about paradox or damage to innocents. Instead
  it gradually lures the mage into a more and more desperate fight
  that will destroy him. For example, Dr. Stanislaus Tergoz spent
  several years fighting an increasingly desperate scientific
  battle against an unknown colleague (the Acrophage), until he was
  killed in a massive paradox backlash after trying to harness the
  power of the entire world against his competitor. Sometimes the
  Acrophage succeeds so well that the mage forgets the path to
  Ascension and instead begins to Descend; the final triumph of
  matter over spirit. The mage has become so obsessed with proving
  his supremacy that he becomes the Acrophage.
