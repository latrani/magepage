Lets try this again:
The Cobra Blade, Level 3, Quintessence 10
This talisman is a band of metal that is worn on the hand around the 
palm, the outside silver, the inside steel.  This band has the ability to 
alter form on activation to any of three froms beside the one described 
above:  a set of metal knuckles plated with silver, a silver katar (punch 
dagger), and a tulwar (a broad Indian scimatar).  Each activation of the 
power allows a virtually instantaneous shift to one of the other forms.  
Also, the user may activate the weapon to generate an effect equivalent 
to the Prime 2 effect "Rubbing the Bones" (page 211 of the 1st Ed. Mage 
rules).  Finally, the blade always remains razor sharp, with no 
expenditure of quintessence.  There are several of these talismans, all 
used by Followers of the Black Flame, an obscure Euthanatos sect with 
it's roots in southern India.  The sect's leader, Ishvarakrishna, founded 
a Chantry in London around the turn of the century, but this Chantry was 
destroyed in the General Strike of 1926.

The Shade, Level 3, Quintessence 12
The Shade is a 1930's vintage Triumph motorcycle, once owned by the 
famous Akashic Brotherhood adventuress Sahara West before and during 
World War II.  It has several abilities which make it unique.  Firstly, 
the motorcycle has a remarkable sense of balance.  This balance reduces 
the difficulty by 3 of any roll  that would benefit from this effect, 
without activation.  It also grants the rider 3 extra dice to Drive rolls 
for a turn per activation.  This allows even a novice motorcyclist to 
drive like a professional, and allows skilled motorcyclists to perform 
feats that even Evel Kneivel would baulk at.  Secondly, the cycle has the 
uncanny ability, when activated, to never hit a red light, never get 
stuck behind a school bus, and always pass just after that absent minded 
pedestrian runs across the street.  This power will work at any speed, 
and is especially useful when chasing or being chased by the bad guys.  
Ms. West never revealed how she came to posess this talisman, and gave 
conflicting reports of its origin throughout her life.

The Eye of the Dawn, Level 5, Quintessence 30
The Eye of Dawn is a hideous talisman, used only by those well on their 
way to becoming Nephandi or those extremely foolhardy enough to risk the 
paradox involved.  This talisman is a bronze sphere, roughly the size of 
an eyeball, with finely engraved hieroglyphics covering its surface.  As 
part of a ritual found only in certain ancient texts, it can replace a 
Mage's eye.  This ritual involves removing the eyelids, and creating a 
unique pattern of scars around the mage's eye socket.  These scars take 
the form of rays coming out from the Eye of the Dawn.  The Eye is then 
placed in the eye socket, where it incorporates into the mages body; it 
can only be removed by Life magick or by the death of the Mage.  The Mage 
will gain the Disfigured and Strangeness flaws, without a gain of Freebie 
Points, if he or she gains this talisman at any time other than inital 
character creation.  The Mage gains five powers from the Eye:

	1. The Mage can now see in any light conditions, through the 
light enhancement capabilities of the eye.
	2. The Mage can now look at any point, and then see as if the 
Mage were standing at that point in space.
	3. The Mage can now probe any persons mind, by staring deeply 
into their eyes.  They can search for specific thoughts, either surface 
or deep.
	4. The Mage can cause in any person a complete breakdown in 
bodily functions, doing damage as an Entropy 4 attack.
	5. The Eye can generate a very bright field of light, equivalent 
to sunlight.  This light can be spread out from the eye like a large spot 
light, or condensed down into a pencil thin beam like a laser, doing 
damage as a Forces 3 attack.

The Eye of the Dawn is very old, and highly prized by many amongst the 
Nephandi and certain traditions, especially the Order of Hermes.  It is 
believed that the Eye may have other properties that can be unlocked, but 
no reliable sources exist as to exactly what these properities may be.
