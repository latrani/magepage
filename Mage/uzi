Description

     The Technocratic Uzi is a newer weapon being used by more NWO and
     Iteration X agents for heavy operations. it was created by the Q
     Devision as a support weapon for HIT Marks. A small number have some
     how fallen into the hands of an anti-Technocracy group of Virtual
     Adepts. The Technocracy was infuriated when they found out and
     immediately dispatched HIT Marks to intercept these V.A.s. Only one of
     them, Todd Skyler, escaped to carry these new weapons to the Horizon
     chantry. Since then, the Sons and Adepts have produced and distributed
     several more of these devices. These devices have 4 settings (powers).
     The weapon is Uzi shaped with a barrel that retracts for one setting
     and lots of tubes and wires on the outside of it. 3 ten point
     quintessence packs are distributed with each weapon.

Powers

     High-Intensity Matter-disruption Setting

     Forces 4 Prime 2

     This setting causes a black laser to shoot forth from the barrel in a
     straight line. This laser causes non-soakable (except with vulgar Life
     magick) Aggravated damage by Arete (don't forget the extra success for
     Forces). Vulgar. 2 Quintessence per shot.

     High-Intensity Mass Matter-disruption Setting

     Forces 5 Prime 4

     This setting causes the barrel to draw into the Uzi and expose the
     laser diode so that a cone of death is created in front of the user.
     Anyone within the 100 yard 60 degree area takes 2 dice worth of
     non-soakable (except, like before, with vulgar Life magicks) Aggravated
     damage (don't Forget the extra success for forces). Vulgar. 5
     Quintessence per shot.

     High-Intensity Cutting Laser

     Forces 2 Prime 2

     This setting closes the barrel tightly so that the diode emits a finely
     tuned laser that cuts through all inorganic matter like a knife through
     butter. It causes only one health level per round to living creatures,
     but leaves horrible, deep scars. Vulgar. 1 Quintessence per use.

     Endless Uzi of Death

     Matter 4 Prime 2

     This essenTially allows the user to fire the device as a standard uzi,
     on full auto, three round burst, or single shot, for as many turns as
     the Quintessence pack holds out. Whenever the clip runs dry, the device
     automatically creates more ammo for 2 Quintessence per use.
     Coincidental or vulgar -- ST's descretion.
