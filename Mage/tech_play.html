      The Technocracy: a fearful word for the majority of mages.
  This organization of mages is poorly understood, and widely
  feared. Most members of the Traditions know only that the
  Technocracy hates magick and seeks to eradicate it. Yet the
  Technocracy sees itself as the savior of humanity, and bulwark
  against darker things from beyond. The true nature of the
  Technocracy is far more complex than the "Big Brother" the
  Traditions believe it to be.

     <h2>
      The Technocracy Manifesto
     </h2>
     <p>
      <br>
       The Original Text, written sometime during the 14th century:
      </br>
     </p>
     <p>
      "We bear witness to the horrors unleashed by the
  indiscriminate use of magick. The Inquisition through which we
  now suffer is in part the reaction of the masses against that
  magick. Throughout history, mages have controlled and manipulated
  mankind, both overtly and from the shadows. They have dealt with
  forces best left alone, with little concern for its possible
  repercussions on the unknowing innocents that dwell nearby.
  Corruption and death follows in their wake.
     </p>
     <p>
      "The essential failing of magick is that it is a specialized
  knowledge, available only to a few, through years of training.
  The majority of mankind is therefore left helpless before the
  machinations of mages, serving only as pawns or peasants for
  magely overlords. For mankind to ever ascend and reach a state of
  bliss, this situation must end. We must bring magick to the
  masses.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We have chosen the vehicle of science to achieve our ends. An
  ordered and predictable magick, it is something the masses can
  utilize without fear, without the random destruction of other
  forms of magick. The application of science is technology,
  magickal knowledge in a form useable by the masses. Technology
  can be used without the years of training required by other arts,
  so that the masses may live their lives and yet not be denied the
  power of magick.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We envision a day when the masses will produce their own
  bountiful crops, through machines and fertilizers rather than
  appealing to shamans and gods to aid them. We envision a day when
  all will be able to travel freely across the world, going where
  they will in days or hours rather than months. We envision a day
  when healing will be available to every man, through medicines
  rather than witchery. We envision a day when the masses may live
  without fear of the supernatural that surrounds them now.
     </p>
     <p>
      "To this end, it is not enough that we provide the masses with
  power through technology. We must actively eliminate the other,
  more harmful forms of magick that threaten mankind. We must seal
  the gates to the other world which other mages have so carelessly
  opened, protecting mankind from the horrors that lie beyond. We
  must provided the masses with an ordered, peaceful world, devoid
  of dark mysteries, that they may at last develop their own
  power."
     </p>
     <p>
      Goals of the Technocracy (added to the manifesto in the 17th
  century)
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       1) Seal the gates to the other world the Umbra, lest dark
    force enter the world and corrupt the masses.
      </li>
      <li>
       2) Wean the masses of their belief in the supernatural,
    which serves only to strengthen their enemies.
      </li>
      <li>
       3) Develop the magick of science to replace their
    dependence on the supernatural.
      </li>
      <li>
       4) Show them the benefits of science by giving them
    Technology that has regular application in their daily
    lives.
      </li>
      <li>
       5) Develop the market and advanced means of production, so
    that Technology will be available to all, rather than a wealthy
    few.
      </li>
      <li>
       6) Encourage the development of powerful, centralized
    governments that will eventually unify to provide the world
    with the peace it craves.
      </li>
      <li>
       7) Work to eliminate the dangerous supernatural forces that
    still dwell in this world, starting with the other, reckless
    mages that threaten reality.
      </li>
      <li>
       8) Prepare the masses through education for an eventual
    revelation of the true nature of the universe, and
    ascension.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <br>
      <h2>
       Views
      </h2>
      <p>
       <br>
        Technocrats: As evidenced by their manifesto, the Technomancers
  see themselves as the guardians of the common man. They aid the
  masses by several means. First and foremost, they war against the
  supernatural forces which the masses have neither the ability or
  the strength of will to resist themselves. They raise the general
  standard of living, by providing new and better technology. More
  recently, they have begun to protect the masses from themselves,
  suppressing dangerous impulses and working to build a better
  man.
       </br>
      </p>
      <p>
       Magick: Technomancers have a mixed attitude toward magick.
  They realize that reality is dynamic, and subject to change by
  will. They also believe in objective reality. The Technocracy
  believes there are underlying laws to reality, which the flagrant
  use of magick obscures. Once magick is removed, these laws can be
  observed, and reinforced, strengthening a fixed and predictable
  reality. All other magick is ultimately flim-flam and hand
  waving, obscuring the true nature of things, but dangerous
  none-the-less for its seductiveness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science: Science is the vehicle the Technocracy uses to
  advance their paradigm. Arguably, it is mere circumstance that
  pressed them to choose science over other forms of magick. They
  could just as well have achieved their goals through religion,
  for instance. By choosing science, the Technocracy accepts and
  reinforces the idea of objective reality. As they are also aware
  that reality is subjective, this leads to some curious
  double-think on the part of Technomancers. On the one hand, they
  study reality to understand its laws, and on the other hand they
  shape reality so that the laws they desire hold true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Technology: Technology is, in many ways, more important than
  science to the Technocracy. While the masses do not understand
  science, they can grasp the benefits of technology. As the belief
  of the masses shape reality, technology is much more useful than
  science. The Technocracy will occasionally reverse engineer
  science to allow or disallow certain technologies. Technology is
  also their greatest gift to the common man, as is reflected by
  the slogan "Technology: Magick for the Masses".
      </p>
      <p>
       Correspondence: A few Technomancers are still attached to the
  idea of absolute space, but with the work of Einstein, most have
  switched to a relativistic view. Given that all space is
  relative, it is subject to all sorts of manipulations. Events are
  all that is important, the space between them is illusory. In
  fact, the division between Time and Space are arbitrary, and it
  will be eventually possible to manipulate time in the same way.
  These attempts to unify Time and Space have been hampered by the
  defection of the Virtual Adepts, the Technocracy's Correspondence
  masters (who in any case were interested in other things).
      </p>
      <p>
       Entropy: The sphere of Entropy is the anti-thesis of the
  Technocracy for it represents decay as opposed to order. The
  Technomancers see this as the sphere of Nephandi, and hate and
  fear it. The few that study it generally only do so to "know the
  enemy", and rarely advance far. The lower levels can be useful,
  however, for reducing chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Forces: Iteration-X are the Technocratic specialist in Forces,
  and preach the view that all is, at a fundamental level, energy.
  The greatest task of Technomancer scientists is the discovery of
  the single force that underlies all others, known as the Grand
  Unification theory of physics. This is also the Technomancer's
  attempt to clean up the disastrous chaos introduced into the
  paradigm by the Sons of Ether's Quantum Theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life: The Progenitors specialize in life, and their view has
  spread throughout the Technocracy. They have a very mechanistic
  approach to living things, that all creatures are the functions
  of various small processes, which if understood, can be
  controlled. They have advanced the germ/virus theory of disease,
  and the genetic theory of evolution. Now the Progenitors advocate
  directed evolution, physically altering man to fit Technomancer
  ideals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mind: The New World Order are the Technomancer masters of
  Mind, and they take a pragmatic approach to the sphere. Mind is
  used for control and information gathering, via such coincidental
  effects as subliminal messages, drug use and electronic
  monitoring. There is little theory behind the New World Order's
  use of the sphere, but other Conventions justify it mostly
  through biological means, viewing the mind as a mechanical
  function of the brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Matter: The Technocracy holds to the view that matter is
  composed of energy, primarily at the insistence of Iteration-X.
  As such, it can be manipulated through infusions of energy. The
  original Technomancer experts of Matter were the Sons of Ether,
  but they left long ago, and Iteration-X has stepped into this
  void. Most Technomancers use Matter pragmatically, to produce
  needed technology and material, and leave theory aside.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prime: Technomancers deal with Prime as all mages must, but
  are uncomfortable with it, as it does not sit well in a
  scientific paradigm. Iteration-X has sought, with little success
  so far, to define it as another form of energy, and this is the
  ultimate goal of their Grand Unification Theory (which will bring
  together the spheres of Prime, Forces and Matter). Oddly enough,
  the Syndicate is the most comfortable with this sphere, as they
  have found a potent metaphor for Prime: Money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spirit: Most Technomancers have difficulty dealing with the
  spirit world, and rarely have much talent with this sphere. The
  exception to this rule is the Void Engineers, who act as
  Technocratic watchmen on the Gauntlet. The eventual goal of the
  Void Engineers is to define the spirit world in terms of deep
  space, with spirit "races" reduced to alien species which mankind
  can meet on its own terms, and conquer. Other Technomancers
  prefer that the spirit world be sealed off from reality, and
  tolerate the Void Engineers only because they are the only
  Technomancer capable of maintaining the Gauntlet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Time: Most Technocratic attempts to deal with Time have been
  through the theory of relativity, trying to unify Time and Space.
  They have advanced to the point where is possible to create
  devices that can look up and down the time stream, but true
  travel eludes them. Most of their work is still done via
  statistical computations to predict past and future events. They
  are hampered by an essentially deterministic view of reality,
  which masters of Time like the Cult of Ecstasy say is a serious
  distortion of the idea of All-Time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paradox: Technomancers look upon paradox as their ally, and
  work to strengthen its power. Paradox maintains scientific
  reality, which sits well with Technocracy. They feel that the
  existence of paradox is a manifestation of the collective will of
  man, and its very existence is a constant proof of the
  righteousness of their goals. It is a dangerous tool, however,
  caring not whether a Tradition mage or a Technomancer violates
  its dictates, striking equally against each. A few Technocrats
  are growing increasingly wary of Paradox, feeling that is may
  someday turn on the Technocracy and drive even science from the
  paradigm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Avatars: Technomancers are generally uncomfortable with the
  idea of souls, and therefore find the concept of avatars
  difficult. Technocrats thing of awakening as an altered mental
  state, a deep connection to the fundamental force underlying the
  universe. They generally ignore the existence of Avatars, and
  rarely contact them. They feel that Tradition mages who
  communicate with their Avatars, or believe in reincarnation or an
  afterlife, are simply deluding themselves. This bleak view of
  life after death have led not a few Technomancers to become
  obsessed with personal immortality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ascension: The Technocracy has many different beliefs on the
  ultimate goal of ascension. They are described in more detail
  under each Convention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Akashic Brotherhood: The Technocrats, immersed as they are in
  the western mind-set, do not understand the goals of the
  Akashics. They admire them for their discipline, but find that
  their ideals contradict the paradigm. They work both to drive
  Akashics out of the West, and to westernize the East, undermining
  the Brotherhood's power base.
      </p>
      <p>
       Celestial Chorus: The Technocrats view religion as the "opiate
  of the masses", foolish at best, and a hindrance to ascension at
  worst. They blame the Chorus for the Inquisition, and much that
  was dark about the dark ages.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cult of Ecstasy: The Technocrats believe the Cult to be too
  caught up in their excesses to be a real threat. Their general
  attitude toward the Cult is "get a haircut, and get a real job".
  Because of this belief, they often mistake active Cultists for
  Marauders instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dreamspeakers: The Dreamspeakers are an anachronism that will
  soon pass away, in the view of the Technomancers. The Technocracy
  actively seeks to undermine native cultures everywhere, by
  "bringing them into civilization".
      </p>
      <p>
       Euthanatos: The Technocracy rarely differentiates these
  Entropy mages from the Nephandi. Technomancers can become very
  self-righteous when dealing with the Euthanatos, calling them
  "mindless murderers" and "serial killers".
      </p>
      <p>
       Hollow Ones: Technocrats find the Hollowers nihilistic
  world-view pointless and foolish, but does attempt to recruit
  other orphans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Order of Hermes: The Technocracy acknowledges that much of
  their views on science and magick are rooted in the Hermetic
  Order. They believe that the Technocracy advanced, while the
  Hermetics are locked into out-dated ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sons of Ether: The Sons were once a valuable part of the
  Technocracy and the wounds of their parting are not healed. The
  general attitude of the Technocracy was that they would soon fade
  without support, but they have held on tenaciously for nearly two
  centuries. The Technocrats are not quite so bitter towards the
  Sons as they are to the Virtual Adepts, and are not above
  excepting some Etherites back into the fold.
      </p>
      <p>
       Verbena: This is another tradition whose beliefs are
  completely alien to the Technocracy. Many Technocrats believe
  most Verbena are linked, knowingly or not, to the Nephandi. The
  Progenitors have a particular hatred of them, perhaps dating back
  to the disputes between Doctor and Midwife of the late middle
  ages.
      </p>
      <p>
       Virtual Adepts: The Virtual Adepts are universally reviled as
  traitors to the Technocracy. They are to be destroyed on sight,
  no quarter asked or given.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marauders: The Technocracy does not understand these insane
  mages, but finds them extremely dangerous. Battle with Marauders
  involve so much damage to reality that it is always a pyrrhic
  victory at best. The Technocracy prefers to stop them at the
  Gauntlet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nephandi: Nephandi typify all the Technocracy finds
  reprehensible in mages. They have willingly sold their souls to
  the evils of the Deep Umbra which the Technocracy strives to keep
  at bay. Only the Virtual Adepts invoke a stronger reaction. A
  closely guarded secret is the number of Technocrats who have been
  discovered to be Nephandi.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vampires: Walking corpses are a violation of the Technocratic
  paradigm, but they maintain such a low profile, that they are a
  low priority. The New World Order and the Syndicate come into
  occasional conflict with vampires over control of various mortal
  agencies, but they prefer to keep these battles indirect, through
  the use of pawns. For those who know of such things, there are
  persistent rumors that the Camarilla and the Technocracy
  cooperated in eliminating the superstition of the masses after
  the Inquisition, and that this cooperation may continue at high
  levels to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Werewolves: The Technocrats would love to eliminate
  shape-shifters from the paradigm, but given that the changing
  breeds dwell in the wilderness and the Technocracy resides in
  cities, they rarely come into direct conflict. The Progenitors
  have been most active in pursuing them, primarily as research
  subjects for their genetic research.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wraiths and Changlings: The Technocracy categorically denies
  the existence of ghosts and fairies. When confronted by them,
  they usually interpret them as some sort of peculiar spirit, and
  work quickly to destroy them. It is perhaps not a coincidence
  that the Fey retreated to Arcadia about the time the Technocracy
  first began to rise.
      </p>
      <p>
       <br/>
      </p>
      <h2>
       Technocracy Leadership
      </h2>
      <p>
       <br>
        In its beginnings, the Technocracy was a secret society, fearing
  discovery by more traditional mages. Some of this earlier
  organization scheme has lingered in the modern Technocracy. They
  are obsessed with secrecy, and the exact leaders of the
  Conventions are unknown, perhaps out of fear of assassination by
  Tradition mages. Low rank Technocrats are left mostly in the
  dark, given orders without explanation, for fear that they may be
  captured and reveal crucial information. This breeds paranoia and
  resentment in the lower ranks, as well as an intense competition
  to go higher and to be "in the know".
       </br>
      </p>
      <p>
       There is supposedly an Inner Circle of the Technocracy, with a
  representative from each convention, that directs the Technocracy
  as a whole. The exact nature of the Inner Circle is a complete
  mystery. They never act directly, instead dispersing their
  directives through secret channels. How the Inner Circle
  interacts with the highest levels of each Convention is unknown.
  Much of what is said of the Circle is purely speculative, and its
  very existence may be a myth.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a similar fashion, each Convention has a hierarchy of its
  own. Each has its own highest leader, often hiding in the
  shadows. Beneath this leadership are several tiers of followers.
  The typical ranking is as follows: non-awakened servants,
  apprentices, working technomancers (disciples), division heads
  (Adepts) and Construct heads (Masters). In multi-Convention
  Constructs, there is often a great deal of posturing to determine
  how the ranks of the different conventions interrelate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truest public governing body of the Technocracy is the
  periodic symposiums held in various locations. Technomancers of
  many different Conventions attend, and engage in massive and
  heated debates about where the Technocracy should direct its
  focus, how it should deal with threats and what new scientific
  theories should be allowed into the paradigm. These symposiums
  vary in scope, from local affairs dealing with specific problems,
  to the yearly global symposium discussing the future plans of the
  entire Technocracy. In theory, any decisions at a symposium are
  made by a simple democratic process, though in practice,
  political scheming is the norm, with high ranking Technocrats
  often able to "swing the vote" of their inferiors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from symposiums and any secret directives that might be
  passed down, different Technocratic Constructs have a degree of
  autonomy that might surprise Tradition mages were they to know of
  it. So long as a Construct works toward the general goals of the
  Technocracy, it may do just about anything it pleases. Constructs
  are expected to aid one another in times of need, and to obey the
  decisions of the symposiums, and can expect censure or even
  retribution if they fail to do so. It is rumored that the NWO
  secretly monitors different Constructs to make certain they
  follow Technocratic ideals, but how exactly they put this
  information to use is unknown.
      </p>
      <p>
       <br/>
      </p>
      <h2>
       The Servants of the Technocracy
      </h2>
      <p>
       <br>
        Traditions view the Technocracy as an organized, global
  conspiracy. The Technocracy see itself as the beleaguered
  defender of man, with its resources often stretched dangerously
  thin. The Technocracy has interests on so many different fronts
  that they often suffer from desperate man-shortage problems. This
  is particularly true of their mages, who are, perhaps, fewer in
  number than the traditions.
       </br>
      </p>
      <p>
       To make up for this lack, the Technocracy makes widespread use
  of non-awakened individuals. Many of these people are unaware
  that they are serving the Technocracy. Iteration-X and the
  Progenitors make extensive use of ordinary scientist to
  "reality-test" their theories. The NWO uses existing intelligence
  agencies to gather much of their information. The Syndicate uses
  ordinary businessmen and organized crime to maintain their
  investments. The Void Engineers indirectly controls virtually
  every space-agency on the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to these unknowing servants, most Technocracy
  Constructs have a large number of mundane employees working for
  them directly. For the most part, these individuals are unaware
  of the magickal nature of their employers, believing they are
  working in cutting-edge scientific research, successful
  businesses or secret intelligence sub-agencies. Even the densest
  them will notice to many strange things over time, however. The
  Technocrats deal with this by cultivating a strong sense of
  loyalty, discouraging questioning, and occasionally wiping
  memories or resorting to more drastic measures. These employees
  also make some of the best recruiting grounds, for their loyalty
  can be observed over long periods of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not all of the Technocracy's servants are ignorant of its true
  nature. The Technomancers have a huge number of "enhanced"
  servants, mostly bio-engineered, cybered and enchanted humans,
  but including a wide array of machines and spirits as well.
  Typical examples of these individual vary from Convention to
  Convention. Man in Black, Hit Marks, and Superiors are amongst
  the best known.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another common servant of the Technocracy are the spirit
  Monitors. The spirits, servants of the Void Engineers, watch for
  breeches in the Gauntlet. Monitors travel in groups of at least
  three. Any serious intrusion in the spiritual realm results in
  one of them fleeing to report the breech, while the rest either
  deal with the intruders, or at the very least cover the escape of
  their comrade. Monitors are quite capable of dealing with minor
  threats on their own, and anything beyond their capabilities are
  soon met by a Void Engineer Strike Team.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would humble Tradition mages to know that their activities
  in the Umbra rate a low priority. Unless they are dealing with a
  major source of power or destruction, the presence of Tradition
  mages in the Umbra might not be reported for hours or even days.
  As a result, most Umbral activities of the Tradition meet with no
  response at all, unless they repeatedly enter the Umbra in the
  same place. Because of this, few Tradition mages are aware of how
  carefully the Technocracy watches the Umbra. Nephandi or
  Marauders in the Umbra merit immediate attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       <br/>
      </p>
      <h2>
       The Divisions of Technomancers
      </h2>
      <p>
       <br>
        The five Technomancer conventions each serves a vital purpose in
  the function of the Technocracy. The New World Order is the
  leader of the technocracy, managing its works, and the government
  of man. It is also their primary information gatherer as well.
  The Syndicate provides the Technocracy with the money necessary
  to fund its projects. Iteration-X and the Progenitors provide the
  bulk of new Technology, both machine and biological. The Void
  Engineer maintain the gauntlet, and explore the dark regions of
  the Digital Web and the Deep Umbra, from which many of the
  Technocracy's enemies come. The Void Engineers also maintain the
  many Horizon Research Realms of the Technocracy.
       </br>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Technomancers that Tradition mages encounter most often
  are the Strike Teams (individually revered to as Field Agents).
  Strike Teams come in a surprising variety of compositions, as the
  Technocracy constantly experiments with new combinations and
  technologies. Usually a Strike Team will include at least one,
  and often several full mages. They will often have several
  enhanced but unawakened soldiers (referred to as Armatures) such
  as Men in Black and Hit Marks, to take the brunt of the damage
  and protect the more valuable mages. Strike Teams often have
  mages from several different Conventions, to maximize
  flexibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strike Teams are the first line of defense for the
  Technocracy. They respond to threats beyond the capacity of their
  sleeping and enhanced servants. Strike Teams also make preemptive
  strikes against enemies of the Technocracy. Field Agents get the
  best training and equipment the Technocracy can provide, but
  their is still some stigma attached to their members. The general
  feeling amongst Technocrats is that research and development is
  more important to the goals of Technocracy, and there is
  resentment on both side of this divide.
      </p>
      <p>
       As they are often in the field, the loyalty of Field Agents is
  very important. The Technocracy does its best to cultivate
  fanaticism in the Teams, sometimes at the expense of common
  sense. Scarce resource and a preponderance of enemies means
  Strike Teams spend inordinate amounts of time away from their
  superiors. Some Strike Teams develop such a rabid hatred of the
  Traditions that they go beyond their orders. Others become
  "distracted", diverting their energies to dealing with the evils
  they see in the world, engaging in personal vendettas against
  crime and corruption, sometimes unknowingly turning on their
  Technocracy allies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another major segment Technomancers are the scientists.
  Technomancer scientists usually work within the Conventions,
  though interdisciplinary research exists. These are divided into
  two major segments: Research and Development. Researchers often
  dwell in specialized Horizon Realms, where they need not worry
  about Paradox in working out their incredibly hyper-advanced
  theories. They pass their ideas on to developers, who work to
  integrate the new advances into the Earthly paradigm via
  extensive "reality testing".
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a conflict between researchers and developers
  analogous to the conflict between pure scientists and engineers.
  The developers accuse researchers of failing to consider the
  feasibility of their studies. They waste precious time on
  pointless research that will never further the goals of the
  Technocracy, even it can be integrated into the Paradigm. They
  spend too much time in their horizon realms, and are losing touch
  with the real world. Some of the ideas they create are simply too
  impractical to ever implement. Developers chafe at the need to
  take all their ideas from researchers, and clandestine engage in
  studies of their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Researchers see developers as timid technicians and
  bureaucrats. After all, the researchers are often a century ahead
  of scientific development on Earth. Developers take too long to
  implement their new theories. Researchers chafe at trivial
  seeming questions of "cost effectiveness" and "minimizing
  disturbances to the Paradigm". A few researchers will circumvent
  the usual procedure, bypassing development and putting new
  technologies directly in the hands of Strike Teams or even
  sleepers, sometimes with disastrous results.
      </p>
      <p>
       To alleviate the problems, most Conventions have a policy of
  rotating mages through both Research and Development, but in
  practice only apprentices regular make these transitions. In
  pragmatic New World Order and Syndicate, the developers have a
  great deal of day-to-day control of the world, and have more
  clout than their researchers. In the more scientific Iteration-X
  and Progenitors, the reverse is true. The Void Engineers, more
  concerned with exploration than control or research, has perhaps
  the most even handed development.

      <h2>
       Technocratic History
      </h2>
      <p>
       <br>
        An excellent history of the Technocracy is given in the Book of
  Shadows (pp. 184-191). The Technocracy, like most Traditions,
  traces its origin back into prehistory, but this is more a study
  in what ideas led to its development. There is no solid evidence
  the Technocracy had any real existence prior to the 14th
  century.
       </br>

      <p>
       <a name="ItX">
       </a>
       <br>
        Iteration-X most likely developed out of Hermetic mages joining
  the the Technocracy during the chaos of the Inquisition. Since
  then, they have monitored and guided scientific advances,
  occasionally interjecting their own ideas. Nearly every
  scientific theory is carefully examined by Iteration-X, and is
  either approved for inclusion in the paradigm, or dismissed as
  useless. Iteration-X does not have an absolute hold on the
  scientific world (as the introduction of Quantum Theory by the
  Sons of Ether shows), but they have a great deal of control.
       </br>
      </p>
      <p>
       Iterators are the ultimate technicians, and design the vast
  majority of the Technocracy's equipment. They are also the
  Technocracy's primary researcher into the physical and chemical
  sciences. Iteration-X mages are the most secluded of all
  Technomancers, often engaged in obscure study in far off realms.
  They have created an wide array of mechanical servants to
  interact with the world for them, and to aid their more pragmatic
  Technocratic allies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite their reclusiveness, Iterators are amongst the
  strongest supporters of the pogrom. Iteration-X is so deeply
  enmeshed in science that they have developed a dread of the
  supernaturals nearly as strong as the sleepers. They direct their
  machine servants to attack Tradition mages wherever they can find
  them. This brings them into increasing conflict with other
  Technomancer who find their tactics to "noisy".
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Philosophy: "The machine is the ultimate expression of the
    values of Technocracy. It is order and perfection. Through
    understanding the machine, we can find enlightenment. We have
    seen that the machine is an intelligence in its own right, and
    will teach us and aid us toward ascension. It is not enough
    that we use technology in our lives. We must integrate it
    fully, with machines taking their rightful place as our allies
    and equals."
       </li>
       <li>
        Organization: Iteration-X organizes itself along the lines
    of the scientific and academic communities, splitting into
    teaching, research and application divisions. It is rumored
    they are lead by an advanced machine intelligence, from which
    they received their name.
       </li>
       <li>
        Meetings: Iteration-X holds regular symposiums of its own
    to discuss scientific ideas. These meetings resemble scientific
    conferences more than anything else. Other than this, Iterators
    rarely interact with each other, as they tend to be more
    comfortable with their machines than other people.
       </li>
       <li>
        Initiation: Iteration-X recruits most of its followers from
    the scientific community. They scour college campuses looking
    for bright minds with magickal potential. Often their recruits
    finish their ordinary education, studying Techno-magick on the
    side. They then spend some time in Iteration-X research centers
    to finish their training. In recent years, the Convention has
    recruited some handicapped individuals for physical enhancement
    via cyberware. This has caused some conflict with the
    Progenitors, who are working to eliminate physical imperfection
    from the paradigm.
       </li>
       <li>
        Chantry: Autochthonia is the greatest Chantry of
    Iteration-X. This machine world has a physical manifestation as
    an "opposite earth", a planet in the same orbit as earth but on
    the opposite side of the sun, hidden from view. Because they
    lack the sphere of Spirit, Iterators access this realm using
    Correspondence. Their Chantries often lack horizon realms,
    though they are warded against spiritual intrusion.

        Sphere: Like the Ahl-i-Batan, Iteration-X has two spheres,
    Forces and Matter, which they believe are the same at a
    fundamental level. They lack the spirit sphere though, because
    the very idea of it is opposed to their scientific world-view.
    Even other Technomancers are surprised at how vehemently
    Iteration-X denies the spirit world.

      New World Order: "They lead us well, which is good, for they

      <p>
       <a name="NWO">
       </a>
       <br>
        The New World Order rose from the Technocracy's need for
  leadership. The NWO not only leads the Technocracy, but the world
  itself. The NWO has been encouraging gradual centralization of
  government, first through nationalism, then through supranational
  ideals like Communism. Their progress has been rather spotty,
  however. As one of the most blatant attempts at Technocratic
  control, the Traditions can easily notice and oppose moves by the
  NWO.
       </br>
      </p>
      <p>
       This Traditions believe the NWO is in direct control of most
  of the governments of the world. This is, in fact, not the case.
  What would be the point of creating powerful centralized
  governments if you have to spend all your time telling them what
  to do anyway? The NWO encourages the sort of governments they
  like, but once they are in place, they only interfere if they
  step out of line.
      </p>
      <p>
       This leave the NWO time for its true calling: information
  gathering. While the NWO has a light touch toward government in
  general, they have a solid hold on most of the intelligence
  agencies in the world. They keep many of their agents in the
  dark, and encourage competition between different agencies as
  well. This way, there are always several groups investigating the
  same problem, and the NWO has gets several different points of
  view. The NWO often "farms out" its information to other more
  appropriate Conventions, for them to deal with.
      </p>
      <p>
       The amount of information the NWO gathers is truly terrifying.
  They have monitoring devices installed in many technological
  devices. Their eyes are everywhere, their spies are legion. Only
  one thing prevents the NWO from knowing everything that happens
  on the planet: the sheer mass of information they collect is to
  much for anyone to process. Many of their recordings are filed
  away "for later evaluation". They are hampered by the fact that
  most of their examiners are sleepers. The NWO tries to compensate
  by spot checking everything, but much still slips through their
  fingers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The simplest solution to their problem would be the heavy use
  of computers, but they avoid this for two reasons. First, they
  fear the Virtual Adepts raiding their information, something that
  occurs far too often in any case. Secondly, in order to evaluate
  the information, mere Expert Systems would not be enough. True
  Artificial Intelligences would be need. The only source for AI is
  Iteration-X, and the NWO is distinctly uncomfortable of the blind
  faith that Convention places in their machines.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Philosophy: "Only through peace can mankind find the
    leisure to ascend, and peace is only available through good
    government. Government is the servant and protector of the
    masses. It is the best means we have available to regulate
    errant supernatural forces, and hide their existence from the
    sleeping world. It is the best means we have to guide the
    masses toward ascension. It is unfortunate that the hidden,
    dark nature of the world often forces government to act in
    secret, but this will pass in time."
       </li>
       <li>
        Organization: The NWO is organized along the lines of a
    complex intelligence agency. Its field agents act as
    investigators, while their superiors assign missions and
    evaluate their information. More than any other Convention, the
    NWO is obsessed with secrecy. No one knows exactly who is in
    charge of the Convention as a whole. There are a few who
    believe that there are in fact several competing groups at the
    top of the NWO, struggling with each other for domination.
    Considering how far the NWO's influence extends, this has
    frightening implications.
       </li>
       <li>
        Meetings: Field agents meet with to their superiors on a
    regular basis to make reports and receive new orders.
    Presumably the superiors do the same with their superiors, and
    so forth, but no one knows how far up the chain of command
    extends.

       <li>
        Initiation: The NWO recruits most of its initiates from
    talent members of various intelligence agencies. The NWO
    maintains secret "paranormal" divisions in various agencies
    which they use a testing grounds for potential recruits. The
    NWO keeps on eye out for talented individuals in the political
    world as well.

       <li>

       <br>
        There is some dispute as to exactly how the Progenitors arose.
  Some believe they were renegade Verbena, joining the early
  technocracy out of fear of the Inquisition. Others say they came
  from the rising medical class, in direct competition with herbal
  mid-wives and their Verbena kin. Regardless of their origins, the
  Progenitors have done much to reshape the way the world views
  life and disease. It is also true that they harbor a special
  hatred of the Verbena.
       </br>
      </p>
      <p>
       The progenitors initially work to win sleepers to their side
  via improvements in agricultural techniques. Their greatest
  accomplishment, however, was the creation of the germ theory of
  disease. By attributing disease to a physical cause, rather than
  a spiritual one, disease could be treated via non-magickal means
  with predictable results. It was even possible to completely
  eliminate certain diseases, something unthinkable in any previous
  paradigm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heartened by their success with disease, the Progenitors have
  pressed forward to pry into the very secrets of life itself.
  Evolution and genetics are the two corner-stones to modern
  Progenitor research. The Progenitors have learned much about the
  living process, and have created a number of new and successful
  species. Meanwhile, their technicians continue to develop new
  theories and chemicals to improve the lives of Sleepers.
  Unfortunately, modern Progenitor obsession with the creation of
  the "perfect" life-form, and the general improvement of man, have
  distanced them from humanity, and they can be quite ruthless in
  their experimentation.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Philosophy: "We now hold the power to control our own
    evolution. The ultimate expression of Technology is the power
    to redefine oneself. We have the knowledge and power through
    drugs and genetics to remake man in a better, more powerful
    form. Through successive transformations, we can advance
    mankind far further than the course of nature would ever take
    us, and thereby ascend."
       </li>
       <li>
        Organization: The Progenitors organize themselves along
    academic lines, in various research and education centers. Each
    major scientific discipline has a Review Board that evaluate
    various Technomancer's work, and determining who will get
    funding and who will be "cut".
       </li>
       <li>
        Meetings: Progenitors tend to be more concerned with
    research than regular interaction with their peers. Any
    meetings they have tend to be practical exchanges of
    information, as well as occasional demonstrations of new
    discoveries.
       </li>
       <li>
        Initiation: Progenitors, like Iteration-X, looks mostly to
    the academic world to find its recruits. In recent years, the
    Progenitors have realized that there are a number of talented
    individuals in the drug world, developing new chemicals and
    strains of plants. Their recruits there also give the
    Progenitors access to a wide range of willing test subjects in
    the drug consuming public.
       </li>

    the monastery where Mendel once lived into a hi-tech research
    center and clearing house for Progenitor ideas.

    can be studied and understood.

       <br>
        The Syndicate was originally composed of pragmatic mages who
  threw in with nascent Technocracy to oppose the chaos of late
  medieval Europe. They developed a specific function by
  introducing Technomancer creations to sleepers. As time went on,
  they developed an advanced theory of economics, whose practice
  they follow today. Many Technomancers are uncomfortable with this
  Convention's growing power.
       </br>
      </p>
      <p>
       Early in their history, the Syndicate realized the future of
  power lay not in heredity, political power, or knowledge, but in
  the control of capital. Where others worked to discover and
  create new things, the Syndicate worked to control the means of
  production. Thus, they reap the profits of others work. The
  Syndicate has fingers all over the business world, in both legal
  and illegal activities. Unfortunately, the Syndicate has lost
  sight of reality, putting profit above all else, including
  morality and even common sense. Younger Syndicate mages pursue
  more and more rapid returns on their investments, sacrificing
  long term productivity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike other Technocratic Conventions, the Syndicate feels
  that a certain amount of randomness in the paradigm is essential.
  Only through competition can individual achieve their true
  potential. People will only give their finest when they are
  rewarded for their work. This attitude has put them in increasing
  conflict with the NWO over the years. Many Syndicate mages feel
  the NWO has outlived its usefulness, and should step aside to
  allow new and vigorous leadership. The NWO, of course, has a
  different opinion. The recent failure of Communism is seen to be
  a move on the part of the Syndicate against the NWO.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Philosophy: "Only the market can bring Technology into the
    home. Through observation of the market, we can see what the
    masses need and demand. The competition of the market brings
    vigor to the lives of the masses, and gives a safe outlet to
    the strife without which life has no meaning. The market
    provides a simple measure of power the masses can understand:
    money. Whether the rest of the Technocracy acknowledges it or
    not, the market now controls the world. Ignore it at your
    peril."
       </li>
       <li>
        Organization: Because of their attitudes towards
    competition, the Syndicate encourages a great deal of autonomy
    in its members. A certain among of scheming and back-door
    dealing is admired. The Syndicate plays for keeps though, and a
    young mage who crosses the line can have his career cut short.
    There are rumors of a central board overseeing the entire
    Convention, but what its purpose may be no one knows.
       </li>
       <li>
        Meetings: The Syndicate mages, despite their independence,
    love to meet frequently, usually in their boardrooms or over
    "power lunches". These meeting range from simple displays of
    wealth and power to secret negotiations against a common
    enemy.
       </li>
       <li>
        Initiation: The Syndicate recruits from business schools
    and already successful businessmen. Because legality is not a
    major concern, they also recruit from successful and wealthy
    criminal overlords as well.
       </li>
       <li>
        Chantry: The Syndicate has powerful chantries in New York,
    Tokyo and Switzerland, but is to diverse to have a primary
    chantry.

       This Convention has, without a doubt, the best reputation amongst
  Tradition mages. This is primarily because the Void Engineers
  have little to do with the pogrom, and therefore rarely come into
  conflict with the Traditions. Because of their pragmatism, they
  have even cooperated with Tradition mages in the Deep Umbra on
  occasional, and they are generally viewed as harmless. Were the
  true goals of the Convention known, this opinion would likely
  change.
       <p>
        The Void Engineer arose to fill a specific need in the
  Technocracy. To close off the gateways to the Umbra, they needed
  Technomancers familiar with the world of spirits. The Void
  Engineers fulfilled this need neatly, not only strengthening the
  Gauntlet, but setting up networks of Techno-spirits to monitor
  its boundaries. The Voiders may have learned to much in their
  journey however, for they could not leave the Umbra well enough
  alone.
       </p>
       <p>
        During their explorations of the Umbra, the Void Engineers
  developed a desire to reincorporate the spirit world with the
  physical world. There were simply too many wonders to ignore. The
  Voiders supported the Technomancer paradigm, however. They
  resolve this conflict by trying to expanding the Technocratic
  paradigm into the Umbra, converting it into deep space. To date,
  they have had little to no support from other Technomancers, who
  find their goals frivolous. The Voiders have, at various times,
  considered defecting, but consider it unlikely the Traditions
  will support their goal either.

         Philosophy: "A study of history shows that a civilization
    maintains its vigor is through expansion and exploration. Yet
    on the limited sphere of the earth, this invariably leads to
    war and death. Only the limitless bounds of space allow the
    expansion needed to maintain civilization without the
    accompanying destruction. When we are ready, we must reopen the
    gates to the Void, not to allow others to enter, but to sweep
    out and claim the universe as our own."

         Organization: Void Engineers have two distinct divisions:
    Ground Control and the Explorers. Ground Control maintains the
    gauntlet and monitoring network, while the Explorers probe the
    Deep Umbra. Ground Control has a complex hierarchy to regulate
    is technical developments, while the explorers spend to much
    time in the field to have any real organization beyond the
    Cabal level.
        </li>
        <li>
         Meetings: Due the Conventions loose organization, they have
    little in the way of meetings beyond the practical level,
    though Voiders do have a penchant for attending Science Fiction
    Conventions.
        </li>
        <li>
         Initiation: The Void Engineers recruit primarily from two
    fields: space agencies and science fiction writers. Oddly
    enough, it is the second group who commonly make up Voider
    Explorers, while recruits from NASA tend to fill out Ground
    Control.

        <li>
         Chantry: The Voiders greatest Chantry is Cape Kennedy,
    though they have diversified considerably in recent years,
    especially in Europe. They are greatly disturbed at the recent
    developments in Russia and the collapse of its space program,
    and suspect there is more to what is going on than a simple
    NWO/Syndicate squabble.

         Sphere: The Voiders are the only Convention to fully
    explore the Spirit sphere. They eventually desire to quantify
    the Umbra as Deep Space, but have yet to come up with any
    unified theory to do so. As a result, they still use many
    outdated Rotes to deal with spirits, drawing heavily from the
    Hermetics. This does not help their reputation with other
    Technomancers.
