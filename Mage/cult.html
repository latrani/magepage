   <blockquote>
    "Death is a beautiful thing..."
   </blockquote>
   Born of a number of wakes that celebrated slightly
  more than common decency generally allows, The Cult of Final
  Ecstasy is the result of some Euthanatos and Cult of Ecstasy
  mages discovering they had quite a bit more in common than they
  had previously thought. The Cultists realized that death was as
  natural a part of things as life, while the Euthanatos decided
  that perhaps they had been missing some of the joys in life due
  to their concentration on death. An uneasy compromise developed
  through future wakes and then suddenly blossomed when the
  Euthanatos realized that the Cultist' time abilities could
  greatly assist in determining candidates for the good death while
  the Cultists discovered that some of their "darker" instincts led
  to a lot of fun as well.
   <p>
    The Cultist dedication to free will and personal choice has,
  perhaps paradoxically, led to a much more constrained version of
  the Good Death being administered. Those who have reached
  low-points in their life are no longer adequate targets, as it is
  understood that they may very well escape the rut they are in,
  instead time and entropy are used together to determine whether
  any hope for this incarnation of the individual may be found.
  Ecstatics feel it is better to help someone in this incarnation
  than to simply force them on to another that may be no better.
  Through future sight they determine the best course of action and
  work to lift the individuals spirits through friendship or even
  fear or, if no other option exists, to help them on their
  way.
   </p>
   <p>
    The major exception to this is that one may be considered for
  death if they are infringing on far too many others free-will,
  which has led them into conflict with the Euthanatos themselves.
  It is also the main difference between themselves and the
  Nephandi as, although they have little in the way of conventional
  morality, they believe everyone should be able to choose
  themselves and the Nephandi coerce their victims far too much for
  the Ecstatics liking. This has led to the Ecstatics infiltrating
  various Nephandi groups at times, which they seem to be able to
  accomplish successfully, only adding to the suspicions the
  Traditions hold about them.
   </p>
   <p>
    Those who seek to cheat death also attract the attention of
  the Cult, as any faltering of the cycle of birth and death,
  destruction and renewal, is within their interest. This is the
  primary reason for conflict between the Ecstatics and the Order
  of Hermes who often use their power to try to live forever.
  Amazingly enough the Ecstatics seem to get on remarkably well
  with vampires. While some of the Cult feel vampires are also
  cheating death the majority see them as existing permanently
  within the Ecstasy, that breaking down of illusions and
  heightened state of awareness that occurs at the moment of death,
  and so treat them almost reverently.
   </p>
   <p>
    They also happen to be on very good terms with the wraith
  community as they feel it is their duty, as guardians of the
  cycle, to help the restless dead continue on their way and so
  assist them in the last vestiges of business they may have
  tethering them to the waking world. Specters, having no wish to
  move on, must sometimes be shoved forcefully into the oblivion.
  They have been very active in the right-to-die movement and the
  doctors among them have no qualms about committing euthanasia
  though it is still against the law. However they are very much
  against abortion, or anything else that may sever a cord before
  it's time.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unfortunately the hedonism of the Cultists, along with the
  proximity of death and the dead has led to the practises that
  hold them condemned among the mage community at large and
  frequently get them accused of being corrupted by the Nephandi.
  Cannibalism and necrophilia are not uncommon among the Cult of
  Final Ecstasy, causing revulsion and hatred among the more
  reserved members of society. The Ecstatics do not feel they are
  doing anything wrong, as the bodies are hardly needed anymore,
  but moral outrage against them has forced them underground. The
  primary reason the Cult does not feel it is doing anything wrong
  is that it never deprives anyone needlessly of their personal
  freedom. No-one is ever killed simply to feed their desires, the
  bodies belong to those that have been killed for other reasons,
  or obtained from other sources.
   </p>
   <p>
    Since the inception of the Cult of Final Ecstasy they have
  found themselves hunted and hated by nearly all sectors of mage
  society, especially their parent groups who seem to take them as
  some kind of personal insult. Only the Verbena seem to accept
  them, passing the cup as it were, as the Ecstatics begin to bear
  the brunt of all the fear, misunderstanding and hatred that they
  have had to deal with over the years.
   </p>
   <p>
    Due to their need for secrecy, their view of subtlety as an
  artform and the rather nasty nature of some of their foci they
  have a general rule
    <em>
     never
    </em>
    do vulgar magic with any
  witnesses and never allow any of the deaths they cause to be
  connected to them in any manner.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Philosophy
   </h2>
   Life and death are a package deal. To forsake
  either for the other is not only stupid, but a denial of the true
  nature of the cycle. Embrace all that life has to offer, face
  death with a smile on your lips and experience the ecstasy it
  brings before passing on to begin the cycle once more.
   <h2>
    Organization
   </h2>
   Due to the secrecy necessary to their
  survival the Cult of Final Ecstasy exist in very small groups
  which often take the form of
   <em>
    very
   </em>
   private clubs. It is
  rumored that some of the Cult's future members have been reaching
  back in time mentally to point out promising candidates or warn
  of some individual who needs to be turned away from their current
  path before things develop any further. Being a fairly recent
  development the Cult is still led by those who created it in the
  first place, most of whom have a small group around them by now.
  There is a very slight variance in emphasis among those founders
  from a Cult of Ecstasy background and those from the Euthanatos.
   <h2>
    Meetings
   </h2>
   The doors of each club are permanently open to
  any member, and permanently closed to any other. Formal meetings
  are rare, but informal meetings, usually full of depravity, occur
  a number of times a week. The founders still get together every
  few months to discuss the "evolution" of their beliefs and any
  problems that may be occurring. A few of the founders still
  remain in their original Traditions, as their membership in the
  Cult has yet to be discovered.
   <h2>
    Initiation
   </h2>
   Some form of mind altering substance is
  usually added to a near death experience to help the initiate
  experience the Ecstasy for themselves. Sometimes this can be
  accomplished by an Elder placing the experience of the Ecstasy
  within their minds.
   <h2>
    Chantry
   </h2>
   No main chantry exists. Clubs within each city
  usually consist of one of the founders and a few others.
  Occasionally wealthy sleepers are allowed access to the clubs,
  though they are kept from knowing what the clubs true purpose is.
   <h2>
    Acolytes
   </h2>
   The decadent rich, grave-diggers, members of
  both the right-to-life and right-to-die organizations, wraiths
  and vampires
   <h2>
    Sphere
   </h2>
   Both Entropy and Time, though they learning both
  Correspondence and Forces at the same rate as orphans as these
  lack any direct relation to The Ecstasy and the dead.
   <h2>
    Foci
   </h2>
   Pain is a wonderful way to focus the mind, and
  torture can bring remarkable turnabouts in other's opinions.
   <p>
    The Ecstasy is the remarkable state of consciousness attained
  during death. Many Ecstatics "ride" the minds of any that die
  around them to experience this altered state of perception as the
  person passes into the shadowlands and hopefully through to
  oblivion. The strength of this as a foci allows the reduction of
  any difficulties it is used for by 1, and if used as a foci to
  either enter or deal with the shadowlands, by 2.
   </p>
   <p>
    All Ecstatics have at least one vice that they use to assist
  their concentration during magic, and to also have a lot of fun.
  Appropriate vices include cannibalism, necrophilia, torture,
  drinking human blood or anything else usually considered morally
  repugnant that is related in some way to death and pain, life and
  sorrow.
   </p>
   <p>
    Due to the nature of their magick the bodies of the dead, or
  appropriate parts thereof, are powerful foci that can be used for
  any sphere and are involved in almost all conjunctional magick
  the Ecstatics do.

     Some Common Rotes
    </h2>
    <hr>
     <b>
      Eyes of the Blind - Correspondence 2
     </b>
     <br>
      The Ecstatic alters his awareness allowing him to see through the
  eyes of the dead. The eyes of the dead provide the main focus for
  this effect, though something once belonging to dead one, or
  another part of the body is needed to provide some kind of link.
  The linking item is held or worn, the eyes are closed and the
  awareness of the mage shifts to that of the corpse. This can be
  annoying if the deceased is under a sheet in the morgue or
  already buried, though it doesn't matter if the corpses eyes are
  closed or not. To get around this members of the Cult commonly
  remove the eyes from bodies and leave them at places they wish to
  observe. The most interesting aspect of this rote however is that
  it also works with vampires.
      <p>
       <b>
        Death Walk - Mind 5 Matter 4
       </b>
       <br>
        The mages consciousness leaves their own body and enters that of
  the corpse, enabling them to use the corpses body as if it were
  their own. This is often used in conjunction with "Eyes of the
  Blind" and/or "Restoring the Flesh" and may account for
  occasional reports of people getting up and walking out the
  morgue...
       </br>
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Taste of the Past - Mind 3 Time 2
       </b>
       <br>
        By devouring the brain of the dead the mage is able to access the
  deceased's memories and learn whatever they wish to know. The
  more successful they are, the more they can learn.
       </br>
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Gift to the Dead - Spirit 4 Entropy 1 Matter 4
       </b>
       <br>
        In dealing with the Shadowlands the Ecstatics discovered that a
  few wraiths could be bribed with certain items from the real
  world. This rote allows them to take any object at all into the
  Shadowlands with them.
       </br>
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Becoming the Lost - Life 5 Mind 5 Time 2
       </b>
       <br>
        The mage must dress in the clothes of the dead one they wish to
  emulate and go to sleep with the deceased inside a coffin. When
  they awake their body has remembered the dead and changed to
  become an exact copy of the deceased, but more than that
  communing with the dead has created a surface mind that, to all
  intents and purposes, is that of the dead one. The mage's true
  mind is in full control of this surface one and directs it from
  beneath the surface. This rote is frequently used to infiltrate
  other groups by "becoming" one of their members. It is impossible
  to detect without magick and extremely difficult to detect even
  with. The main fall down is that the user retains their own
  spirit, though perhaps further studies will lead to the
  correction of this.
       </br>
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Voice from the Grave - Spirit 2 Entropy 1
       </b>
       <br>
        The skull or still intact head of the wraith they wish to contact
  will begin to speak in a disturbing manner. Most bargaining with
  the dead is begun in this manner.
       </br>
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Wake the Dead - Spirit 4 Entropy 1
       </b>
       <br>
        Mainly used in conjunction with "Restoring the Flesh", this rote
  will bring a wraith back into the land of the living. The
  Ecstatics commonly use this return to physical form as a
  bartering tool with wraiths, helping them complete business they
  still had on earth. Due to their unease at disrupting the cycle
  in this way, any body the Ecstatics may grant a wraith will only
  be temporary.
       </br>
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paying the Boatman - Spirit 3 Entropy 1 Mind 1
       </b>
       <br>
        By sleeping in a used coffin, still containing the bones of the
  deceased, with a coin over each eye the mage will wake within the
  shadowlands. Going back to sleep in the coffin will allow the
  mage to return. Mind is used to allow sleep at will.
       </br>
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Hitchhiking on the Highway to Hell - Spirit 3 Entropy 1
  Mind 5
       </b>
       <br>
        Experiencing the Ecstasy of someone's passing the Ecstatic can
  send their mind along with the dying one, effectively
  astral-traveling into the Shadowlands.
       </br>
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Glimpse Beyond - Spirit 1 Entropy 1
       </b>
       <br>
        Staring into the eye sockets of a skull the mages perceptions
  shift and they begin to see into the shadowlands. This can also
  be used without the skull but in conjunction with "Eyes of the
  Blind" to peer into the shadowlands anywhere.
       </br>

       <b>
        Restoring the Flesh - Life 5 Matter 4 Time 2 Prime
  2
       </b>
       <br>
        The bodies of the dead contain the memories of their past. By
  means of this the entire living body can be reformed from any
  part of the corpse. This is frequently used to supply bodies for
  familiars, other spirits, or more commonly wraiths in tandem with
  the rote "Wake the Dead".
