   The Black Sun

   Even the greatest souls can become twisted, corrupted by their
  learning, power or love. Judith Freeman is one such fallen
  greatness.
  </p>
  <p>
   Once she was one of the brightest voices of the Celestial
  Chorus, a beloved visionary and mystic. Throughout her life she
  devoted herself to the Chorus and its mission, but she had a
  mystic bent that made her more aware of the higher spheres than
  the here and now, making her a bit too otherworldly for most
  sleepers (and quite a few of the more practical brethren).
  Instead she sought inner wisdom, trying to reach the shard of the
  One she felt within her. She felt its need of togetherness, the
  great yearning for unity, for reconciliation, that all of
  creation felt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Had she not met with Griscard Rochman her life and work would
  surely have been different. Griscard was one of the children of
  Caine, a dark shadow irresistibly drawn towards the light of
  Judith. He watched her from afar, fascinated by her spiritual
  beauty, her power, her faith. Finally one night he approached her
  on the roof of the chantry, desperate to get near her despite the
  danger to both of them. Judith calmly listened to his black
  confessions, and forgave him. She became fascinated by the
  Children of Caine, and during subsequent nights she listened to
  the lore that spilled from the lips of Griscard.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally the temptation became too great, and she let him drink
  her vitae - and he let her drink his. In their union, Judith felt
  something she had never experienced before: a soul touching a
  soul, a shard of the One touching another shard of the One
  (albeit corrupted by millennia of degradation). Enraptured, they
  mingled their blood, unifying life and death. In that crucial
  moment revelation hit Judith, and she began to sing a new song.
  She realised a way towards the One, a way to bring all the lonely
  shards of the primal unity back together. Using her magick she
  drank more of Griscard who lied helpless in her arms. She drank
  his soul, uniting it with hers.
  </p>
  <p>
   As the sun rose above the trees around the chantry, Judith
  watched it filled with joy and fear over what she had done. At
  her feet a pile of ashes blew in the morning breeze, but her
  beloved was within her, united in her soul.
  </p>
  <p>
   Over the next weeks she gradually learned. She felt the hunger
  of the vampire, and saw it for what it was: a desperate,
  unarticulated longing for unity. She understood why the children
  of Caine coveted the blood of each other and the mortals, and
  forgave them.
  </p>
  <p>
   When she eventually revealed what she had done to the deacons
  of her chantry, she was surprised by their reaction. How could
  they fear and denounce what she had done? Had she not shown them
  the way towards reconciliation, of the great unity of life and
  death? When they ordered her to do penance for her crime, she
  replied that she would do penance, but not for her deed, but to
  purify her new united soul from the sins of the children of
  Caine. It was too much, and she was expelled by the council.
  </p>
  <p>
   For a long time Judith was sad and confused by what had
  happened. Why could they not accept her vision? How could such
  bright masters be so blind? But she eventually realised that many
  people were as fearful of unity as they longed for it, a fear
  that held the fragments of the One apart and lonely. But their
  opinions did not matter, only compassion mattered. She set out to
  unite all lonely souls - by devouring them.
