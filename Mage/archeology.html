      Myth tells of lost empires, places that existed once but are now
  lost to mankind after the drawing closed of the Gauntlet and the
  mapping of the world by the Technocracy. Some of these places,
  including El Dorado, have been found, but two great empires have
  long remained hidden and unexplained by generations of mages.
  Places about which legends existed long before the coming of the
  Age of Reason. Places we cannot find even in the Umbra, even
  though belief in them is strong. We speak of Atlantis and
  Lemuria.
     </br>
    </br>
   </p>
   <p>
    Yes, this may sound somewhat absurd, but these two places
  began to figure prominently in our prior researches into the
  history of the Ten Traditions and the origin of the schism
  between the Technocracy and the Traditions. History tells us of
  the last 2000 years, mythology of 5000 before that, and magic and
  the spirits speak of times back a further 13,000 years. But
  there, they stop. No hints, just refusals to give information.
  Many claim not to know, others grow hostile as they are pressured
  for information. Even the magic of the Spheres cannot push back
  this veil in time, a Gauntlet shielding us from our own past.
   </p>
   <p>
    There is a reason for this. Approximately 20,000 years ago,
  there was a great catastrophe, that rent not only the physical
  Terran realm, but the entirety of the Gaian Tellurian. An event
  of proportions undreamed of probably even by the Oracles.
   </p>
   <p>
    But we have succeeded where others have turned away, and have
  gathered what we feel to be a picture of two great empires of
  humanity, from the time before time, in the midst of what the
  Technocracy would term the Ice Age. There is a reason for why
  they wish this time to be lost, shrouded and hidden in the memory
  of artic ice over the land. The truth is far more
  frightening.
   </p>
   <p>
    But before we tell of the fall of these great empires, let us
  describe them, their culture, their people, their rise. While we
  know nothing of the origins of these empires save as an evolution
  of the multitude of tribes that roamed the Tellurian, back in the
  times when there was no Gauntlet, and the Realms flowed, melding
  and mingling freely. The Realm of Mu was known for its
  Spellweavers, and the lush greenery of the landscape, whereas the
  Realms of Atlantis was known for its harsh climates, rich mineral
  resources, and tough, hearty people. Blessed by two different
  circumstances, the tribes of these two realms were slowly
    <br>
     unified, becoming a force in their region of the Tellurian.
    </br>
   </p>
   <p>
    But their ambitions did not end there. As the Atlanteans began
  to tame their own land, their people acquired and placed value
  upon categorization, forcing things to pattern. Their scholarship
  was of science, and ritual, and crystal. Great ships plied the
  skies between the realms, and formal religion and ritual were the
  rule.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Lemurians, however, were a more passive, or rather
  permissive people. They tended to meld and shape the world around
  them with a subtle, gentle touch. They shaped trees into housing,
  the animals into forms they needed, and the very world around
  them into paths and trails that led from one Realm to the next.
  Thus did they grow, and prosper.
   </p>
   <p>
    As both empires grew, within them grew the strength of magic,
  powers unbeknownst to any who still walk the mortal plane. Death
  was not yet a fixture, and time flowed in odd ways around their
  leaders, the most powerful magi of their respective cultures.
  Eventually, a dynasty formed in each empire, and they began
  exploring in earnest.
   </p>
   <p>
    Somewhere, the two empires met, and began to trade, then to
  compete. As they both grew, the Tellurian seemed not large enough
  for both of them, and tempers began to flare. Then disaster
  struck.
   </p>
   <p>
    The details are sketchy, but it seems as though the Realm of
  Atlantis had grown unstable from all the crystallization of
  reality around it, and the pattern spontaneously snapped in
  several places, releasing incredible amounts of energy,
  destroying countless lives and property. Accusing the Lemurians
  of this act, the Atlanteans began an assault on the Realms of the
  Lemurians, swearing to aveng ethe deaths of their people.
   </p>
   <p>
    The battles were great, and many died on both sides. Great
  spirits from the farthest reaches of the Gaian Tellurian and
  beyond were brought to bear, and the damage was horriffic. But
  there was no clear winner, and after almost a century of
  fighting, the two battle-weary sides agreed to a reluctant truce,
  dividing the Tellurian into two seperate spheres of
  influence.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus began a new age of prosperity, even as distrust brewed
  between the two empires. They expanded aggressively, opening
  paths far beyond the reaches of the Gaian Tellurian. They spread
  out far and deep into the reaches, to realms that are
  indescribable to the sane. But they came, they conquered, and
  they continued onward.
   </p>
   <p>
    Somewhere along the line, somehing was discovered by the
  Lemurians. Or maybe, something discovered them. Outposts and
  villages would suddenly disappear, falling off the face of the
  Tellurian, leaing nothing but idyllic countryside with a strange,
  ominous feeling to it. Soon, entire Realms were falling victim to
  this strange plague, which was now leaving twisted ruins, warping
  the entirety of reality and leaving only deformed, pained things
  in its wake.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Lemurians felt this was a new weapon developed by the
  Atlanteans, and as soon as they shut off the main connections to
  the border Realms, they began assaulting the Atlanteans,
  demanding retribution and tribute. THey fought fiercely, and the
  Atlanteans were humbled, though not defeated, and soon they began
  to fight back.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sometime during the war, however, this plague sprung up in
  Atlantean Realms as well, twisting and deforming their worlds.
  Suddenlyrealizing that there was a common enemy, they set aside
  their arms, and worked great magics, eventually forming the
  Membrane that surrounds the Gaian Tellurian. But this had the
  effect of limiting their space to grow, eventually forcing them
  to conflict.
   </p>
   <p>
    And eventually, that conflit came. The continuing pattern
  degredation of Poseidia, the core Atlantean Realm, had reached a
  point that it shattered, leaving a group of nine Realms linked
  together by tenuous pathways. This was the excuse the Atlanteans
  needed to finally try and destroy the Lemurians, and they
  launched a war of total genocide.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is here that the records begin to break down, and reality
  itself meant nothing during the war. But there are two facts that
  stand out strangely: One, that the Lemurians seemed to be much
  less numerous than reported, and Two, that both empires were
  suffering a form of madness that drove their actions far, far
  more extreme than even war would allow for.
   </p>
   <p>
    The spirits spoke at length about the Garden, at the heart of
  Lemuria, and the Battle of the Garden, a nearly century-long
  conflict that left millions of Atlantean soldiers dead, ending in
  the capture of the Guardian, a spirit of unknown power, though
  probably of near-Celestine level. It had been harnessed only
  through the combined magical might of the three living Princes of
  Atlantis and their mated sorceress-queens.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is said that rather than simply accepting oblivion, the
  spirit chose instead to uise a gift that only the most powerful
  of the royal households possessed, they Dying Curse. In doing so
  this spirit consigned itself to reincarnating as a human, as that
  was the form it was slain in, but it slew the entire house of
  Atlantis, in perpetuity. In a single instant, all the royal blood
  of Atlantis fell to dust, destroyed utterly.
   </p>
   <p>
    All, save one. The Atlantean king was too powerful to be slain
  immediately by the magics of the Guardian, though watching his
  wife and family crumble to dust before him shattered his already
  unhinged mind. He stormed to the heart of Poseidia, where there
  stood a great crystal that powered the greatest machinations of
  the Atlantean empire. In a fit of rage and madness, the king
  aimed the Great Crystal through the Tellurian, at the heart of
  Lemuria. Through the very heart of Gaia.
   </p>
   <p>
    Gaia awakened, screaming, transfixed by this incredible burst
  of energy. Wounded and outraged, She smashed the Tellurian,
  sweeping away the Realms of Mu and Poseidia, casting them away
  into the Abyss. As Her righteous rage abated, She reshaped the
  Tellurian, forming the Terran Realm, where she would try and keep
  the humans in check, as they had proven to be Her most wayward
  children. This was when She created the Garou, and the idea of
  the Impergium. And thus was the forming moments of the
  Gauntlet.
   </p>
   <p>
    Only three questions remain in the hearts of the researchers
  at this time, but they cause us to miss sleep at night, when at
  the odd hours there is walking heard among the Maze of Dreams
  (detailed in another supplement, which I'd like to track down
  sometime).
   </p>
   <p>
    1) What was this great plague, and subsequent madness, thatso
  infected these empires?
   </p>
   <p>
    2) What happened to the Lemurians who did not fight? They
  fled, but no record is made of where, or how. Or if they ever
  made it.
   </p>
   <p>
    3) What of the Atlantean king? He is said to have survived
  Gaia's rage, yet nothing is recorded of him save his name:
  Belial.
