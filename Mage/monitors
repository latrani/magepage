   The Monitors:
        In the earliest fights against the Order of Hermes and the
Traditions, the technomancers and their earthly allies were not alone.
They had the aid of several spirits, making deals with them to gain
their support.
        These spirits received much for their aid.  They have been fes with
quintessence, given dominion over spirits that joined the cause later, and
acess to the physical world.  More importantly, the technocracy has
pledges that with the defeat of the traditions, the Monitors will not be
swept over an conquered by the hordes of man.  They will become friendly
alien races, and powerful AI systems, and many other things, while those
who did not join will be hunted to extinction.
        Over the centuries, the once diverse and naturalistic spirits
that were origionally receuited have changed to meet the technomancer
paradigims.  They have abandoned roots in the natural world and
become more technological in nature.  They have become entrenched in the
technocratic command structure and are among the technocracy's most
valiant defenders of the gauntlet and horizin against the horrors of the
umbra.
        The Monitors are still widely varied.  Some are small and weak,
while others are virtual leviathans.  Many are unique, while others have
standardized to the extent that they are identical.  Many have specialized
to heed the calls of specific Void Engineer rotes, and fight in the
ascension war at there command.  The following are a small sample of their
vast diversity.

   The Satellite Monitors:
        Ever since before Sputnik, the Void Engineers have had their own
satellite systems girding the earth.  Sleepers think of satelites as
complex machines and marvel at their abilities.  The technomancers know their
true capabilities.  They are massive techno-fetishes, enabling Monitors near
the horizin to sense the physical world.  A few allow them to attack in
the physical world too, but none allow them to actually materialize.
Types of satellite monitors follow:

  Communications Monitors:
        These indispensible devices provide sleepers and technomancers
alike with an easy means of moving information arounf the globe.  All
kinds of transmissions are carries, from TV to phone conversations to
computer information.  Naturally, all is recorded and beamed to the NWO.
        Technomancers acess the higher functions of these devices and
the spirits attached to them.  In the umbra, the Communication Monitors
appear as fractal balls made of metal with lighning playing over their
surfaces.  The satellites skirt the inside of the Horizin, and are connected
by arching beams of energy which form a web of light that stretches farther
than the eyes can see.  There are rumors there this "Horizin Web" has
an internal reality, much like the Digital Web has one in the gauntlet.
Contact with the beams causes violent force effects.  The Communications
Monitors are not very effectual in a fight, but defend themselves and the
Horizin Web.
   Attributtes:  Str 1,  Dex 3,  Sta 2,  Cha 1,  Man 2,  App: 0,  Per 4,
Int 3, Wits 2.
   Abilities:  Alertness 2, Computer 4, Enigmas 3.
   Spheres: See Magick below for specific abilities.
   Willpower: 5
   Arete: 3
   Quintessence: 3
   Paradox: 0
   Health levels:  OK / -2 / -3 / -5 / incapacitated
   Attacks:  Ram -  the only physical attack these spirits have is to
ram an opponent.  This causes damage equal to their strength, but their
powerfully electrified surface causes three additional dice to bring the total
to four dice.
   Magick:  The Com. Monitors can use the following rote effects:
- Securte Transmissio Web ( Entropy **, Forces ***, Mind ***, Prime ** )
This is used as a massive communal magick that maintaines the Horizin Web.
It gives the web's strands the following properties:
        - 4 Countermagick Dice vs. attempts to interrupt, read, or alter
inter-monitor signals.
        - Monitors are aware at ant activation of the Countermagick.
        - A Forces three genreal-spectrum attack is made one anyone that
countacts the Horizin Web.
- Injection ( Correspondence *** ) - The Monitor self-digitizes and moves
through the Horizin Web to a distant satellite.

   Satellite Monitors
        These spirits are highly valued by the technocracy.  They spy on both
the earth and the Deep Umbra, looking for enemy action.  By circulating
storys about the accuracy of spy satellites and having authorities refute
them, sensor acuity is enough to read license plates and the like without
fear of paradox.
        The Monitors associated with these satellites have a number of
sensory abilities.  In the umbra they appear as metal, many-eyed incestoid
creatures.  They are slightly larger than man-size, and have beautiful
solar-pannel wings.
   Attributes:  Str 3,  Dex 3,  Sta 3,  Cha 2,  Man 2, App 0,  Per 5
(photo-realisitc), int 4, Wits 3.
   Abilities:  Alertness 5, Awareness 4, Computer 3, cosmology 3, Enigmas 3
   Speres:  See Below
   Willpower: 5
   Arete: 5
   Quintessence: 5
   Paradox: 0
   Health Levels: OK / -1x2 / -2x2 / -3 / -5 / Incapacitated.
   Armor:  The metal exoskeleton of the spirit gives it two dice of armor.
   Attack:  The spirit can attack with it's razor-sharp probiscis, causing
Str + 1 damage.
   Magick:
- Monitor Gauntler ( Corresponcence **, Entropy *, Spirit *, Time ** )
This rote lets the Monitor scan the gauntlet and the horizin.  The rote
searches out and predicts weaknesses and rifts, reporting them immediately
to Void Engineer teams.
- Monitor Earth ( Correspondence *8, Forces *, Mind *, Spirit * )
This lets the Monitor extend it's senses to the earth.  It can sense
the entire electromagnetic spectrum with incredible acuracy and evaluate
all it sees.  Developing technologies to allows this to operate through
weather disturbances has been an area of constant research.
- Alert ( Correspondence **, Forces ***, Prime ** )  With this rote
a Spy Monitor accesses the Horizin Web and downloads intormation to
technocract computers.  Problems are red-flagged as are assualts on the
Monitor itself.

  "Killer" Monitors:
        The Void Engineers have relatively few of these combinations of
huge spirits and powerful devices.  They were launched during the Regan
"Star Wars" era and are orbital battle stations.  None have been launched
since SDI was discountinued and the VE's are disgruntles when their
allies deemed it necessary to discontinue the sleeper projects which
helped them place these without paradox.
        In the Umbra, a single spirit is associated with each ASAT.
These are shaped like thick, bloated worms.  They are covered in
metal to the extent that only they and the VE's know if they are not
entirely technological.  They have beaked mouths surrounded by a ring of
clawed tenticles.  They have various powerful weaponry.
        They are universally guaridans of areas of importants.  Places
where the Horizin is very weak, where an Umbral assault is predicted,
where "white holes" the VE's have tapped are located and in the
center of clusters of other monitors are likely locations for them.
   Attributes:  Str 7,  Dex 2,  Sta 8,  Cha 2,  Man 2,  App  0,
Per 4,  Int 3,  Wits 4.
    Abilities:  Alertness 2, Athletics 2, Brawling 5, Firearms 5.
   Spheres:  see below
   Willpower:  8
   Quintessence 15+
   Paradox: 4
   Health Levels:  OKx3 / -1x3 / -2x2 / -3x2 / -4x2 / -5x2 / Incapacitated
   Armor:  The metal plating gives the Monitor three extra soak dice.
   Attacks:
- Bite - The killer Monitors can Bite for ten dice of damage, but must
grab the victim and put them in their mouth first.
- Tenticles - A Killer Mointor's six tenticles can be used without dividing
it's dice pool.  The tenticles cause seven dice of crughing damage with a
diggiculty seven attack.  Attacking with more than one tenticle causes one
more die of damage per tenticle.  The claws can be used to cause eight dice
of damage with a difficulty seven attack in place of a crushing attack.
   Magick:
- Over-Monitoring ( Correspondence **, Entropy *, Time ** )  This allows
the killer monitors to watch over a large number of lesser monitors.  Time
allows it to predict where it will be needed.  It is also receptive to
messages sent by other Monitors and Void Engineers with high clearance.
- Shock ( Forces ***, Prime ** ) - This simple forces attack electrifies
the spirits skin in a Forces 3 attack.  This causes six dice of damage.
Any thing grappling it that takes three dice or more will have let go.
It does affect those in it's tenticles, but it can't crush at the same time
without splitting it's dice pool.
- Laser / Particle Beam ( Forces *****, Prime ** )  This powerful
attack can only be used on distant targets or those in front of the creature's
mouth.  It causes 24 dice of damage and burns five points of quintessence in
the blast.
- Assign Aura Monitor:  ( Forces 5, Prime 2, Spirit 2 )  This allows the
Killer Monitor to assign an Aura Monitor, a type of monitor with less power
and authority, to a target.  Any one killer monitor will onyl hace command of
three of these at a time.


   Aura Monitors
        These Monitors traditionally have been the guardians of Void Engineer
umbral research stations.  Recently, at the urgings of fellow technomancers
to become involved in the pogrom, the VE's have been using them as magickal
assasins.
        These spirits are composed entirely of complex energy fields, and
can be "projected" into the physical world through special VE equipment.
They are often directed by Killer Monitors or high level Void Engineers
to attack individuals who threaten their goals.
        In appearance, these spirits are very beautiful. The are floating,
shimmering curtains of miltichromatic light.  They are beleived to
originally have been nature spirits associated with the northern and southern
lights, and are most populous at the poles even today.
   Abilities:  Str 0,  Dex 5,  Sta  4,  Cha 3,  Man 1,  App 5,  Per 2,
Int 2,  Wits 4.
   Abilities:  Brawl 3, Cosmology 3
   Spheres:  See Below
   Willpower:  5
   Arete:  4
   Quintessence:  8
   Paradox:  3
   Health Levels:  Ok / -1x2 / -2x2 / -3x2 / -5 / Terminally Disrupted.
   Attacks:
        While an Aura Monitor has no physical existance, it can cause the
energies about it's edges to briefly solidify, a quick slash while doing
so makea a whip-like attack that causes four dice of damage with a
difficulty of six.
   Magick:
- Manifest ( Spirit *** ) - Unlike most Monitors, the Aura Monitors can
make themselves seen and act in the material world.
- Quantify Avatar ( Prime * ) - The Monitor can sense strong avatars.
If attacking a group it attacks them preferentially.
- Reform ( Correspondence ***, Spirit *** ) - The Monitor can fade from
it's present location, disperding it's energies and re-forming elsewhere in
the Umbra.
- Radiation Attack ( Forces ***, Prime ** ) - To perform this, the Monitor
must perform a grapple ( it has no strength, but this lets it superimpose itselfover another ).  Once this is done it intensiries it's own energies,
causing damage due to radiation and microwaves, as well as electrical
disruption.  They prefer this attack, for it kills cleanly and leave no
external evidence as to the cause of death, as the damage is entirely
internal.  Progenitors can hush up any "natural-looking" death like this
very easily, faking autopsies and the like.


   Digital Monitors:
        I have not yet detailed the Monitors on the Digital Web.  Many of
the defenders of technoturf are really daemon Monitors.  Thereare also
some monitors akin to electrical elementals.
        The Void Engineer spirit 2 effects often call upon Monitors
for many tasks.  One such taks is self-guided weapons, in which the
Void Engineers even surpass the Iteration X convention.  Void Engineers
have smart weapons as small as tranquelizer darts and small-caliber
bullets.  They also have very small, one-shot, anti-personell missile
pistols, with brilliant-level micromissiles.
        If anyone has any ideas for more, please post or e-mail them to
me.
