    Aliens are the simplest to deal with. Kill them. Actually,
    there may be Aliens who are interested in helping us and being
    nice to us, but I haven't met that many and frankly, I'd be
    suspicious of their lore in any case. The big problem is trying
    to figure out how to fight them. Don't assume the same trick
    works twice, or even once. Notify the Technocracy. They hate
    the Aliens just as much as we do, and they have more firepower
    to deal with the threat. Let them get themselves bloody in the
    process, just make sure they enforce their "no Alien tech"
    policy. Their R&amp;D guys are too weird already.

   In regards to your manuscript, I would like to take
  this opportunity to request consultation on the following
  matter(s), be they related or unrelated:
   <p>
    Just short of two years ago, my friend Dr. Boson was
  approached by a Dreamspeaker (who shall remain anonymous at his
  own request) for advice on a particular series of events which
  took place in the state of New York, in the Adirondack Mountains.
  This appeared to be out of desperation on the part of the
  Dreamspeaker, and it surprised us that one of that tradition
  would approach a Son of Ether for advice on any matter.
   </p>
   <p>
    It appears that a friend of his, a werewolf which was
  described as a Stargazer, had encountered what appeared to be a
  human hiking in that area. Becoming interested, said werewolf
  used some mystic means of their own to ensure that this person
  was what it appeared to be (which I gathered they do to most
  anyone they encounter.) The result of this scrutiny, as described
  to us, was that this "person" was absolutely devoid of any "Wyrm,
  Weaver
    <em>
     or
    </em>
    Wyld" energies. The Mention of the Wyrm
  concept in your document is what prompted me to request your
  advice. As it was elaborated to us, Wyld and Weaver describe
  dynamic and static forces in the particular vernacular of the
  Dreamspeakers and Garou.
   </p>
   <p>
    The werewolf in question, according to this report, watched
  this being for some time until finally approaching it. This
  entity and the werewolf apparently had some sort of discourse
  which left the werewolf absolutely confounded as to the nature of
  who or what it was addressing (though it contended, at first,
  that it was just a hiker passing through.)
   </p>
   <p>
    Said werewolf, after leaving the company of this thing,
  immediately contacted our Dreamspeaker (who is apparently an
  friend of his) and asked him to examine this stranger to see what
  he could make of this. What the Mage found was even more
  extraordinary. After much elaboration, it was reported to us that
  this entity had
    <em>
     no
    </em>
    ethric pattern which was recognizable
  as such,
    <em>
     no
    </em>
    sort of detectable spiritual presence, and
  was apparently not affected at all by Entropic forces. Regardless
  of the above, it seemed to have some sort of material substance
  for any practical purposes (though no underlying ethric pattern,)
  some sort of mind which could be detected (though barely
  recognized as such) and a
    <em>
     very
    </em>
    strong and unique
  Quintessence flow (apparently though nothing at all) of
  unrecognizable resonance.
   </p>
   <p>
    According to report this entity was apparently benign and
  friendly in a very passive and curious sort of way. It recognized
  the Mage for exactly what he was, but didn't seem at all
  impressed, and spent the entire night in conversation with him.
  When asked what it was, it appeared to have extreme trouble
  trying to describe this in any terms which the Mage could
  understand.. and when asked where it had come from it apparently
  could not even comprehend the nature of the question. This did
  not, however, keep the being from asking any number of questions
  about extremely commonplace things and concepts in a manner which
  suggested that it had no experience with these things at all. It
  appeared to have some grasp of what humans were and how they were
  supposed to act, as well as knowledge of particulars concerning
  human society which would only normally be known by a world
  traveler of advanced age. All of this, however, appeared to be of
  extremely academic nature. When asked why it was present at all,
  the only answer it could give was that it had nothing better to
  do.
   </p>
   <p>
    Subsequently the Mage and his werewolf companion, still
  utterly confused, undertook some sort of quest into the Umbra in
  pursuit of advice from what he referred to as "Pheobe".. which is
  apparently the Moon (this confuses me, I must admit.) Details
  aside, they received the sought after consultation and were told
  that the being they had encountered was not "from here," was to
  be left completely alone, and was not dangerous if not
  threatened. When pressed concerning the idea that it might be
  useful as an ally against the Wyrm, they were advised that the
  conflict was not its business or concern and that intervention on
  its part would not be appreciated by any involved party.
   </p>
   <p>
    Bringing this particular anecdotal report to a close, there is
  one final note which might be related. Three weeks ago, according
  to a report given to us by a Hollow One of my acquaintance, an
  altercation between a group of Men in Black and a clique of
  Hollow Ones in the City of New York was drawn to an unexpected
  end when a person fitting the physical description of the entity
  above was caught in the crossfire. Although there was some
  variation in report (probably caused by the state of intoxication
  of the witnesses) this "person" was struck by a stray magickal
  assault from a MiB (of a sort which would have killed any normal
  human, but apparently served only to annoy it) and proceeded to
  "obliterate" the offending Technomancer by some means which,
  though it appeared magickal, could not be sensed as such by
  anyone present. As described, the Mage did not wither, burst into
  flames, explode, implode, or turn to dust.. it simply looked
  extremely surprised and suddenly vanished. According to one
  description, "reality just ate it."
   </p>
   <p>
    When the Technomancers attempted to retaliate, they were
  "knocked flat with a look" and promptly retreated. The individual
  then simply walked off after telling the curious Hollowers to "go
  do whatever it is you do."
   </p>
   <p>
    I am extremely curious as to your opinion on these reports,
  and what (if anything) should be done in pursuit of them.
