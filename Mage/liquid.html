   Jason looked at the man in dark suit across the street. Such
  emptiness, no trace of new possibilities... this unfortunate soul
  was in desperate need of the Good Death. He moved silently back
  into the shadow.
   <p>
    "Excuse me sir, do you have any spare change?" The man looked
  into the dismal alley, right into Jason's unkempt face. Jason
  struck out with his hand in a silent and swift movement, intended
  to painlessly and cleanly break the man's neck. To his surprise
  his hand just sank into the flesh instead of connecting with
  bone. With more confusion than fear, he saw how his hand had
  seamlessly merged with the man's throat like molten rubber. A
  strange numbness spread from his hand.
   </p>
   <p>
    Desperately he tried to pull away, but only managed to drag
  the still expressionless man close to himself. He tried to shove
  him away, but his free hand just melted together with the suit,
  which had become fluid and warm as flesh. With a scream he backed
  away, tripping over a pile of trash and falling over with the man
  on top of him. The last thing Jason saw before their faces merged
  was how the expressionless eyes had begun to melt.

    These nightmarish beings appear to be vaguely allied with the
  Marauders or Nephandi, if they are indeed allies and not
  creations of the mages. The liquid people look human, at least to
  a casual observer. Closer scrutiny will however reveal that their
  bland and expressionless faces are somehow inhumanely smooth,
  almost as if they were painted onto their heads. The nose lacks
  nostrils, and the mouth has no teeth. They never speak or do
  anything to attract attention, and their clothing is uniformly
  bland.
    <p>
     It's when they are hurt or in a fight that the difference
  become obvious. Their bodies and clothes are made of liquid
  flesh, flowing smoothly from one form to another. Wounds will
  just seal up, with no bleeding. Arms and legs bend jointlessly,
  and are quite elastic. When their flesh comes into contact with
  the flesh of another being, it will instantly and painlessly
  merge with it. A person striking a liquid person will suddenly
  find his hand seamlessly joined with the opponent. Further
  struggle usually brings them closer into contact, and usually
  ends in both combatants being melted together into a single mass.
  When this happens, the mass slowly divides into two new lumps of
  flesh, which reform into two exactly identical liquid people
  looking like some kind of average of the victim and the liquid
  person.
    </p>
    <p>
     The liquid people are not particularly bright, and often
  behave a bit like discreet sleepwalkers. They have an amazing
  ability to avoid notice, just walking along with other people and
  following the crowd. Their origin is unknown. Some mages claim
  they are a Technocracy experiment. One possibility is that they
  are a failed Progenitor experiment. Another is that they are the
  raw material for the Men In Black. Other mages guess that they
  are spirits lusting after the stability of material life, or some
  kind of magickal disease. And there is some evidence they might
  be used by the Marauders and Nephandi for unknown purposes. Some
  fear that they are stocking up for a wholesale invasion with
  liquid people, turning them into an unstoppable army. Others
  equally fear that the liquid people are already among us,
  secretly doing the bidding of their masters.

     Liquid people seems to almost completely lack willpower. If
  confronted with a problem, they just give up and walk away. They
  don't have any thoughts or emotions, and their memories are hazy
  and "soft".

      Merge:
     </b>
     Their liquid flesh will merge with any other
  flesh it touches, immediately growing into it. This doesn't feel
  like anything, the victim just feels a strange numbness in the
  area. The two persons will be inseparably joined unless the link
  is severed in some way. To be able to merge, the liquid person
  has to touch skin to skin (its clothes doesn't work very
  efficiently for this, taking several turns to merge with flesh).
  When a victim has been more or less completely attached, the
  liquid flesh flows around and into him, turning him into liquid
  in a few turns.
    </p>
    <p>
     All attacks done by the liquid person (who usually uses its
  fists) which touch an unprotected person will cause a merging.
  The same is true for all brawl attacks against it. It's enough
  that the attack hits, not that it does any damage (if a dodge
  manages to evade the attack nothing happens). Instead of doing
  any damage to either the victim or liquid person, the attack
  results in a partial merge or a more complete merge. When the
  total "damage" reaches 10, both have merged totally and start to
  unite completely. The only way to escape the merging is to sever
  the connections, all attempts to push away will just result in
  further merging.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Regeneration:
     </b>
     The liquid people are fairly immune
  against damage. Penetrating damage like guns or knives simply
  heal directly, just causing the flesh to flow together. If a
  cutting weapon manages to sever a limb or a head, it will fall
  off and dissolve in a puddle, doing just one point of aggravated
  damage. Aggravated damage (magick, fire and acid) work as normal,
  destroying parts of the person which fall off. It will take seven
  aggravated wounds to completely destroy it.
    </p>

     <b>
      Undetectable:
     </b>
     Liquid people are normally practically
  impossible to spot in a crowd. They blend in completely, leaving
  no trace. When among other people, increase their Arcane to
  6.
