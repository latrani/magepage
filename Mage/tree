Subject: Blood of the tree

Among some sects of verbena the tree is not seen simply as a metaphor for
the tradition and centre of the chantry. Within sanctums trees can have a
very real link to verbena, based on beliefs about not distinguishing
between different types of life. Here are some examples which Verbena may
be aware of (but other paradigmed mages may be oblivious to):

Tieing the life-weave.
The pattern of someone (or something) is linked to a tree in the sanctum so
that the tree reflects their state of health. The most basic form of the
ritual consists of planting a sapling and watering with blood from the
subject. The blood is drawn by carving a sharpened wand from a branch of
the parent tree that the sapling sprang from and using that to puncture
holes in the skin of the subject. Whereever the subject goes the tree will
echo the health of the subject (Life 2+ Life 1+ Correspondence 2). Other
variations exist which monitor spiritual health (where the blood is brewed
together with other 'workings') and mental health (where the ground for the
sapling is prepared using the sacred knife). The tree that the subject is
linked to can serve as a symbolic focus for magic directed against the
subject, though directly harming the tree will not damage the subject.

Holding the branches of fate.
A runic staff, carved in a calendar of the year, is prepared. It serves as
a support for a sapling which is planted in the sanctum of the coven. All
of the members of the coven contribute blood to strengthen the tree to bear
the weight of the coven's fate. The tree grows linked to the fate of the
sanctum. (Life 2+ Time 2, The tree reflects dramatic events that are about
to occur at the sanctum. i.e. suddenly splitting apart shortly before an
overwhelming technomancer attack). The mages may not be aware of exactly
what is going to happen, but the get an idea of how benificial/ baneful it
will be.

Tree of knowledge. (A repeat from a few months ago)
A Verbena pours knowledge into the tree shaping it's growth. Cutting
his/herself with the sacred knife the knowledge pours out in the form of
blood. The more knowledge the more blood. Old verbena have been known to
create a permanent record of their experience for their comrades (and die
in the process). The knowledge shapes the trees growth, and after a week to
a season (depending on the amount of knowledge) it can be read by creating
a small blood link to the tree and tracing the growth (Mind 3 + Life 2, the
duration determines the length of experience that can be written/read).
Reading the tree can follow the main 'trunk' of the experience, or folow
side branches as the reader sees fit. Virtual Adepts have a similar effect
called hypertext.

Knowing Home:
The mage fashions a wand from a branch of a tree in the sanctum, sealing
over the trees wound with their own blood. When the mage is away from the
sanctum they need only hold tight to the wand to know what transpires
around the parent tree (Life 2 + Correspondence 2).
