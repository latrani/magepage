   Void Engineer Paradigm

   <h2>
    The Paradigm
   </h2>
   <b>
    The Continuum
   </b>
   : All reality is
  encompassed in the space-time continuum, following strict
  relativistic rules.
   <h2>
    Magick
   </h2>
   <b>
    Technology, Research and Exploration
   </b>
   :
  Unexplored reality is a blank slate upon which exploration writes
  the rules and expectations of future colonists. Clearly,
  technology is the most useful tool of these explorers. New
  research also reveals new areas of exploration or technological
  development (which is usually passed on to Iteration X, which is
  better suited to development).
   <h2>
    Spheres
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <b>
      Correspondence: Space
     </b>
     -- the relativistic
    measurement of distance between events in the continuum;
    Propulsion -- movement through space via increased vectors
    (although these vectors still cannot exceed the speed of light,
    unless utilizing experimental FTL drives). Transmission/
    reception -- techniques for sending and receiving signals
    across great distances.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Time: Time
     </b>
     -- the other half of the time-space
    continuum, Time speeds or slows relative to movement through
    the continuum.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Pattern Magicks: Patterns
     </b>
     -- Everything that exists
      can be scanned as a pattern. While Iteration X creates new
      technologies, the Void Engineers are most interested in
      gathering information about new Patterns discovered in the
      Infosphere, Ectoplasmic Regions and the Metareality. Under
      this paradigm, Matter, Forces, Life and Mind are all
      considered patterns.
     <p>
      <b>
       Scanning
      </b>
      -- the most active application of
      Patterns. Using advanced Transmission technologies, scanners
      can reach great distances.
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <b>
        Forces: Energy
       </b>
       -- includes various applications
        of Energy, including weapons, shields,
        audio/video/holographics, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        Life: Biology, Medicine, Pharmacology
       </b>
       -- The VEs
        use the Progenitor Life paradigm entirely. However, their
        greatest emphasis is on identification of new patterns
        (this is their most common coincidence when exploring deep
        space in search of life).
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        Matter: Elements and Composites
       </b>
       -- one area of
        great interest to the Void Engineers is the "discovery" of
        new elements and composites from the three realms. Thus,
        new elements may come from the Infosphere, the
        Metareality/Deep Space or the Ectoplasmic Regions.
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        Mind: Brainwaves
       </b>
       -- the mind acts as a rather
        powerful transmitter of brainwaves. These waves can be
        scanned as a pattern (hence their reorganization under
        Patterns), replicated with technology, and altered with
        energy or pharmaceuticals.
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Entropy: Chaos/Pattern Recognition
     </b>
     -- research into
    chaos theory suggests that patterns exist even within
    apparently chaotic sets.

      Spirit: WARNING -- TOP SECRET CLASSIFICATION. CLEARANCE
      OMEGA ONLY.
     </b>
     <p>
      Infosphere: the "High Umbra" of the Void Engineers, this
      realm encompasses all accumulated knowledge, artificial
      intelligence and data storage and manipulation. Accessible
      via virtual reality and other immersive technologies. Void
      Engineer research into lucid dreaming has also proven
      effective in this area, allowing the subject to tap into this
      realm of pure information.
     </p>
     <p>
      Metareality: the "Middle Umbra" of the Void Engineers,
      this realm is the most secret area of research for the Void
      Engineers. The Metareality appears, to the Void Engineers, to
      be the "back stage" of reality, the source of all Patterns
      (see below). This dimension is highly unstable. Also, other
      alternate dimensions are accessible through the Metareality.
      These other Continua are simply different arrangements of all
      the same patterns found in the Metareality. The Metareality
      is partially synonymous to Deep Space, the most common and
      public paradigm. For now, Deep Space is mostly a vacuum until
      the Void Engineers can decide what to find in it.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ectoplasmic Regions: the "Low Umbra" of the Void
      Engineers, exploration into this post-life netherworld is
      nearly as secretive as the Metareality. VE research into the
      Ectoplasmic Regions involves the controlled reduction of the
      explorer's life patterns, allowing the explorer's mind to
      enter the region while still being able to return to its
      body.
     </p>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h2>
    Arete
   </h2>
   <b>
    Discovery
   </b>
   -- the more a VE has discovered,
  the greater her understanding of the Continuum.
   <h2>
    Quintessence
   </h2>
   <b>
    Research/Exploration
   </b>
   -- quite
  literally, research makes the subject at hand more real. Void
  Engineers "accumulate" research in terms of time spent performing
  said research or exploration, then converting those hours into
  "findings."
   <h2>
    Paradox
   </h2>
   <b>
    Unexpected Findings
   </b>
   -- this is the most
  vexing problem to the Void Engineers, who seek only to "discover"
  entirely expected findings. An Unexpected Finding means the
  entire continuum is in danger, until addition research time can
  be alloted to disproving the finding.
   <h2>
    Mage-specific Backgrounds
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <b>
      Arcane: Security Clearance
     </b>
     -- the highest levels of
    Void Engineer research occur at the strictest security
    clearance levels. This tends to insulate the engineers from the
    rest of the population. The higher the Arcane, the higher the
    security clearance and thus the higher amount of
    insulation.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Avatar: Brilliance
     </b>
     -- this allows the engineer to
    accumulate greater research time and thus generate more
    complete findings.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Destiny: Focus
     </b>
     -- Scientists with intense focus can
    work miracles and never stray from their research. Those with
    this much focus are invariably brilliant and arrogant. Highly
    focused scientists are not above stealing other scientist's
    work and some have made their names solely by this method.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Dream: Lucid Dreaming
     </b>
     -- the VEs apply this
    meditative technique as a method of accessing the so-called
    Infosphere (see Spirit, above). Those not trained in this
    technique need virtual reality equipment to search the
    Infosphere for information.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Node: Research Facility
     </b>
     -- a place where research
    can be maximized and distractions can be minimized.
