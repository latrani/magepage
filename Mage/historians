Objetives: The Historians are a subgroup of New World Order who are 
dedicated to change the history to benefit us and our objetives.

General Information: 
The modifications to the history they design are called Changes.
A Change is a very complex process, because is necessary to hand a lot of
information and the consecuences of a little change can be vast and 
uncontrollable.
This huge information handling only was really useful after the developement 
of computers.Before that, all the calculations had to be done by the human 
computers of the Sons of Ether (see file SOE3657GU), slower than real 
computers. Anyway, a Change is a slow process, that usually takes months 
of hard work.

Structure of a Change:


1. The Choice.
   Three members of the Historians meet with representatives of the five 
   Conventions to decide what Changes are needed. Of course, each 
   Convention tries to get its proposals accepted by the Historians, but
   they only choose the Change most beneficial to all the Conventions, 
   usually what is proposed by New World Order.
   
   1.1. Motives of a Change.
        
        1.1.1 Elimination of old paradigms.
              
              This is the main objetive of the Historians,and they have been 
              very succesful.Any rest of the old paradigms(i.e. the Celestial
              Chorus' paradigm in the western world. see file NWO298792OP)
              must be deleted,an any evidence of magick must be disguised as 
              superstition and legend.
              This tactic, to disgise real history as legend, has bring us
              our most succesful Changes (one of the most incredible Changes,
              because of its difficulty and the success we got was the  
              concealament of everything related to the history of the grail.
              see file NWO30098AG)
        
        1.1.2 Substitution of old paradigms for the Convention's paradigm.     
              
              One of the most dangerous threats to the Conventions is the
              possible spread of a belief in the existence of other 
              paradigms, like the proposed by the Traditions. The mission of
              the Historians is to make sure nobody has the opportunity of
              "accidentally" discovering that our reality is not the only
              possibility (We know our paradigm is the best, but this kind of
              knowledge could be dangerous to an untrained mind).
              Another reason for this substitution is the fact (this theme 
              was studied long ago by us (see file NWO732168PS)) that people
              accept any knowledge more easily as older the knowledge is. 

        
2. Analysis.
   Two things are analized by The Historians:
    
   2.1. What does need to be modified.
        The Rote Locate Physical Rests (see file NWO38690DW)is used in an 
        object related to the historical fact that is going to be Changed.
   
   2.2. Possible consecuences.
   
   
   If too many things need to be modified (usually because the Change 
   proposed is more important in the flow of the history than it seemed) or
   the consecuences too uncontrollable (the Change has too many ramifications) 
   then the Change is rejected and other Choice is proposed.
   This is the opposite of what is done by the Forecasters, the group of
   Technomancers dedicated to predict the future and who seek these points
   with many ramifications (or bifurcation points, as the Forecasters call 
   them) and try to use and modify them.If this kind of modifications were 
   used by the Historians in their work, the Paradox produced could destroy
   the Historians and possibly many years of work of the whole Technocracy.
   This reasoning has drove the Historians to the "rule of minimum Change".
   Following this rule, they try to adjust the history to achieve what they
   want making the less possible modifications to the history.
   (i.e. When skeletons of giant reptiles were discovered, the old legends
   about dragons were Changed for modern theories about dinosaurs.
   Unfortunately, we were unable to erradicate the stories about dragons,and
   this is a serious threat to our objetives.The current wayy of work is to
   make the dinosaurs very popular among the Masses to get a total oblivion 
   of dragons in year 2040.Jurasic Park (with the cooperation of Progenitors
   and The Syndicate)was a very useful tool to achieve this goal.Tests have
   been made to subjects aged 8-12, and have demostrated that most subjects
   don't remember dragons flew and breathed fire, but are able to point the
   differences between many types of dinosaurs.)

3. Execution.
   Once the Change has been accepted, the third step begins.
   
   3.1. Destruction of proofs.
        The first step is to destroy any physical rest of the historical 
        fact and delete(or modify) any written record of its.
        
        3.1.1. If the rest has not been discovered (i.e. any archeological
        rest below the earth) then is directly destroyed using the rote
        Reality Erasure (see file NWO38691DW).
        
        3.1.2. If the object if known by the Masses ,proofs are build to 
        show what is "really" the object (i.e. see file NWO32226HI: The 
        holy bed-sheet.) A very good tactic is the use of radioactive tests 
        to know the "real" age of an object,like the C-14 test to use in 
        organic objets( see file ITX98373EH).
        
        The modifications to written texts are not as radical, because it is
        not necessary. Each year (or decade) the history books are revised
        and a new edition is written, and each new edition is subtly changed
        to suit our needs.The effect is so subtle that only if two editions 
        with more than 20-25 years of difference between them are compared
        the modifications could be seen, and even if they are perceived, 
        are usually imputed to the "new discoveries"(our other Changes).
        
        
        3.1.3. Sometimes, this kind of demostrations have already been done 
        by scientists.In this cases the tactic is to denounce this rests as
        falsifications, discrediting any scientist who had proved the
        authenticity of the rest. If the scientist persists in his theories,
        he must be eliminated (i.e. the discoveries in the Tutankhamon's 
        tomb (see file SYN439803GD) produced the elimination of Lord
        Carnavon, some members of his family and many other people who had
        discovered the real treasure.Our agent in the field, Howard Carter,
        did a great work. Unfortunately, the Traditions used these deaths to 
        spread the idea of a curse, that was easily accepted by the gullible 
        part of the Masses.This idea has damaged us in our efforts to make 
        the Masses forgot the old superstitions and it has made us to be more 
        careful in other eliminations).

   3.2. This step (usually mixed with the first) consist in creating new 
   proofs about the historical fact you want to "prove", followed by the 
   "discovering" of these proofs, usually with a big display of propaganda
   (helped by The Syndicate) to make the new history known by the greater
   part posible of the Masses.
   


Personnel:
   Historians:The typical group of historians is composed by 6 members.  
        
        2 Analists. Working closely with some members of the Forecasters,
                    they analize the ramifications of a Change and decide if
                    the Change is possible.
        
        2 Field Agents.They locate and destroy(or modify) the physical rests
                       of history and make the necessary "deals" with 
                       archaeologists and other scientists about the rests
                       already discovered.
  
        2 Publicists. They work with the Syndicate to make our version of the
                      history widely kwown among the Masses. They use any 
                      mean in their hands to spread their ideas, from 
                      commemorative festivities (of events that really didn't
                      exist or events that existed in a different way as are
                      remembered (see file NWO93748HI: Woodstock) to books or 
                      movies.
                      
               
        10 Men in Black
        The MIB are used when is needed a direct action against a target.
        This actions can be as different as to intimidate a rebel scientist
        or to eliminate a dangerous Tradition mage.
        The MIB are also used to protect the Historians' construct together
        with security guards extracted from the Masses.


    
Consecuences:
  Do the Historians change really the history ? 
  The right answer is: Sometimes. As it is explained before, the Historians
  change the history changing what is known by the Masses, who change the 
  history (remember belief=reality) themselves.But there is a problem:
  Reality doesn't like to be changed, and if there are a significant number 
  of Masses (this number is unknown by the Historians) that know the real 
  history, even if they are greatly outnumbered by the Masses who know 
  the modified version , then the history will not change.  
  
  [ Storytellers note:
  If Time 2 is used to see the changed event, it will be seen the original 
  version, or more usually, a version with the original and the 
  Technocracy-altered history mixed or superimposed, as with Divided Sight 
  (corresp. 3) ].
  
  Only if no sleeper knows about the real history,and all believe in the 
  modified version, the history really changes.
  
  [ST note: The use of Time 2 will show the new history].

  Another problem found by the Historians is that the parts of history 
  related to awakened beings and powerful magick are almost imposible of
  delete or change, so the tactic used is to disguise history as legend
  (see above).

Paradox:
  The Historians are (with the posible exception of some members of 
  Iteration X ) the Technomancer subgroup more affected by paradox forces,
  not because of the vulgarity of their effects (most of them are 
  consistent with the paradigm) but for the important modifications of the 
  history they implement.

  The forces of paradox usually strike in one (or both) of this ways:
  
  1. Changes in personal history.
      
      Some members of the Historians have noticed important modifications on 
      his personal lives, such as a different house . In extreme cases, even 
      the people they know are not the same.
      Evidence of these changes has not been found, but careful interrogation
      of the subjets suffering these effects make us to think that Paradox
      changes the personal history of the Historians, just like they change
      the history of the world.

      All these changes make them psicologically unbalanced,so they are  
      strongly watched over by all the Technocracy, especially by NWO
      (another reason for this vigilance is the importance of their work).

  2. Paradox Realms.
     In some extreme cases a Historian has been trapped in an alternative
     reality (a typical case of paradox realm) where the Change that
     the Historian was working on had been twisted in a strange form. The 
     classic example is the reality experimented by a Historian who was 
     working in the discovering of America,who was trapped in a paradox realm
     where Europe was discovered by american natives before the middle age
     and the dominant paradigm was the imposed by the Dreamspeakers.
      
      
  (This is a typical show of "poetic justice" as is usual in the paradox
  reactions. Some of our best brains (natural and artificial) are 
  trying to modify this demeanor to make paradox a more impersonal force 
  (see file TECH382) ).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use: This Rote is used by the Historians (see file NWO659783IV).
Knowledges needed: Correspondence 2,Mind 3,Matter 1,Time 2.
Known effects:This Rote analize the impact of an object in the flow of   
              history (Mind, Matter, Time) and locate other objects related
              to it (Correspondence,Matter).
              To make effective this goals, the object is analized, 
              discovering its origin and most of its particular history, 
              then, complex statistical works are made to see what 
              people remember about the historical fact related to the  
              object.
              Then, a complete investigation work is done, searching
              in museums, private colections, doing archeological works,
              etc, to find the objects related to the target of the
              Rote.
              The results of the investigation are exponential, because as
              other objects are found, the Rote is cast upon them and with
              each casting more and more objects are found, so all the
              investigation around a historical fact is done in relatively
              a short amount of time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use: This Rote is used by the Historians (see file NWO659783IV).
Knowledges needed: Prime 4,Correspondence 2(4).
Known effects: The rote extracts all the raw Quintessence of an object's
               pattern.The object thus disappears from reality.
               Similarities has been discovered between this rote and the 
               effect known to members of the Celestial Chorus as Flames of
               Purification.

               Correspondence is required only if this rote is not casted to 
               an object near the mage.
               Correspondence 2 to cast the rote (line of sight).
               Correspondence 4 if the use of Qintessence is needed (as 
               usually does if working from a distance.Line of sight is
               hard).

Use: This Rote was used by the technocracy before the construction of modern
     computers.It was developed by the Sons of Ether before leaving the 
     Technocracy.
Knowledges needed: Time 3,Mind 4,Life 4,Forces 2. 
Known effects: This rote transforms a human being in a powerful computer
               allowing to connect the subject of the rote to a printer or
               other output machines and accelerating his mind processes.
               The continued use of the rote upon a subject kills him 
               (death caused by brain damage).
               This rote is more useful if casted on a Awakened subject, 
               whose mind is more flexible.The usual tactic is to use 
               the Rote in a captured member of the Traditions (to use a 
               Marauder or Nephandi is very unpredictable).

Subject:The Grail
Acces granted to classes: A,B,HI.

Start of File.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Appearance: Unknown. Described as a chalice, a cauldron, or another 
             completely different thing, deppending on the source.
 
 Powers: Unknown, but rumors say that is able of awakening people who drink 
         its contents.
        
        The Grial (and everything related to it) was a main target of the 
        Historians (see file NWO659783IV) during some time. Its history, 
        and all its mystical connotations had to be destroyed. The 
        elimination of all the facts related to the Grail was impossible, 
        but the causes of this are yet unkwnon.The only possible alternative 
        was to transform the history in legend.When the Change was analized, 
        some apparent incongruences were detected, what made the Historians 
        to think that the history of the grail was already changed by the 
        Celestial Chorus, to make a powerful symbol as the Grail closer to 
        their believes.
        Anyway, the Grail has remained in the imagination of the masses
        during too much time, and this have to be changed. A new project is 
        being developed by the Syndicate: a "famous director" is working in
        a film that will relate the Grail to alien beings, in an attempt to
        destroy all the mysticism in its history (see file SYN987870).

please feel free to mail me asking for it. 
Anyway, comments are welcome. Hope you like it.
