   The Social Engineers
  </h1>
  <h5>
   By Anders Sandberg
  </h5>
  <hr>
   The Social Engineers are a relatively liberal sub-convention of
  the New World Order, involved in the spread of collectivism and
  the idea of the welfare-state. While they seemingly lack power
  both over Reality and the Technocracy, their real influence is
  profound. The Engineers are a force to be reckoned with, and they
  are often underestimated.
   <p>
    The Engineers are responsible for bureaucracy, social
  engineering and the idea of a welfare society where everybody is
  equal, supported and cared for by the state. Their ideal is
  collectivist, where everybody happily obey the state, since the
  state helps them (as opposed to the conservative NWO, which wants
  to terrorise everybody to obey). This should be done using a
  large bureaucracy, which plan the best course of action and
  direct people to it. They dislike the idea of individuals, and
  prefer to see that power is wielded by the system, not people.
  Private initiative is frowned upon, since it is often not adapted
  to the needs of society as a whole, and often is quite unplanned.
  The Engineers want to let all planning and initiative to come
  from the appointed bureaucracy, which will plan the best course
  of action.
   </p>
   <p>
    Their first great success as a sub-convention was to
  demonstrate how they could turn rebels and anarchists into useful
  tools for the Technocracy. In the Russian revolution, they turned
  what just a few months before the revolution was a small group of
  fanatics into an ruthless and powerful elite. Partly through
  luck, skill and clever politics, the Technocracy managed to
  create a powerful state controlled mainly by the NWO, with
  crucial help from the Engineers. The Engineers was responsible
  for the creation of Soviet bureaucracy and many other aspects of
  society after the initial mayhem ended. While their
  administration was hardly the best from the standpoint of the
  Syndicate, the society the Engineers had created turned out to be
  a massive success for the Technocracy, and was to test out new
  methods of control and planning.
   </p>
   <p>
    After this success, the Engineers wanted to spread their
  visions. They started with Scandinavia, where they already
  skilfully manipulated and created popular movements. They decided
  to use the Social Democratic Party, a small and obscure leftist
  group as a starting point. Using their manipulative skills, the
  Engineers made the party to grow, helped by many of the popular
  social movements. Finally the Socialdemocrats gained power in the
  30's. During the next 30 years, the Engineers started to create
  the Swedish Model, using the Party.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Engineers are extremely anonymous. Actually, not even
  other Technomancers see them much. They are even more anonymous
  than the most paranoid Progenitors. They surround themselves with
  an impenetrable bureaucracy, which implements their plans and
  supply them with information and recommendations. It is quite
  possible that there are very few Engineers left inside, and the
  bureaucracy is running itself. This would mean the convention has
  succeeded in replacing itself with almost entirely sleepers,
  something no other convention have ever dared to try. Even the
  Engineers themselves seems to dislike the use of magick and high
  technology. Instead they rely on organisation, planning and
  experts.
   </p>
   <p>
    The most spooky thing about the Engineers are that they are
  omnipresent. Every other convention rely on bureaucracy to some
  extent. Most modern states could not exist without their
  administration. And yet, they are almost completely invisible.
  While the Traditions fear the infiltrators of the Progenitors,
  the Men in Black from the Syndicate and the cyborgs of Iteration
  X, they always underestimate the Engineers. This is also true
  inside the Technocracy, where most technomancers are content to
  believe that the Engineers are a part of NWO. In the meantime,
  the Engineers may plan something, and nobody expects
  anything.
   </p>
   <p>
    While the Syndicate control Big Business and much of the
  criminal world, and NWO control much of the Military and
  Intelligence business, the Engineers control Government
  bureaucracy completely. Of course, Engineer control is always
  extremely subtle and somehow woven into the system. When the
  Engineers want to change something, they do it completely legally
  and in an ordinary way. Their bureaucracy and every other
  bureaucracy are seamlessly joined, and no sleepers even notice
  the fact. The bureaucrats simply get their orders from a distant
  department most employees never have heard from. Should anybody
  check it out, it will turn out to be perfectly normal and
  according to routine. And who gave the order to the distant
  department? Well, another department which sometimes sends them
  orders to implement. And so on into infinity. There is never an
  end when the Engineers are involved.
   </p>
   <p>
    What are their goals? It seems that they like their own
  bureaucrats once they have gained power, will do anything to
  retain it, but do not want to go further. Once this convention
  was responsible for the revolutions which shaked Eastern Europe.
  They created the Scandinavian welfare-states. But when they had
  gained enough power, they became more and more conservative. The
  radicals left for the other parts of New World Order, but most
  members preferred to spread their bureaucracy without any obvious
  goal. As long as nobody interferes, the Engineers are content to
  watch what is going on. But if somebody threatens them, they can
  bite back subtly and yet ferociously. Another goal, besides their
  preservation of their administration, is to spread their idea of
  society across the world. While they mostly was content to
  support the countries they had formed, the fall of Eastern Europe
  became a shock. Many Engineers realised that they had let things
  slip too far, and began to try to reassert themselves around the
  world in different ways. They have started to try to save what's
  left of Eastern Europe, and have began to counter the advances of
  the Syndicate in Scandinavia. In America they have started to
  spread their ideas, trying to create a more efficient social
  security and health care system. They are trying to turn the EEC
  into their domain, in hard conflict with the Syndicate. Overall,
  the Syndicate tend to oppose the Engineers, while the New World
  Order tend to protect them.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Engineers are masters of manipulating social movements
  using organisations and public opinion. Instead of supporting
  groups they approve of in any obvious way, like helping them in
  the bureaucracy or hindering their enemies, the Engineers often
  help them by making their organisations work better. An
  organisation which otherwise would have trouble surviving due to
  internal conflicts and lack of funds will begin to stabilise,
  becoming more efficient in spreading its opinions. Quite soon it
  will have become much larger and powerful (and as a rule less
  extreme, whatever its original opinions were. The Engineers
  dislike fanaticism).
   </p>
   <p>
    The Engineers seldom use magick. In fact, it can be questioned
  whether they really are mages or some kind of awakened
  accountants. They seem to understand what the other conventions
  are doing, and support them. But they never influence reality in
  any overt way. Instead they rely on the administrative structures
  to do their magick. When they actually use magick, it is always
  coincidental, and often extremely normal. A form has not been
  properly signed. A change in regulations. Somebody has lost the
  documents. Due to security reasons which happens to apply in this
  case, access to certain information must be restricted. The
  person responsible for a certain problem is on holiday. The
  committee will not meet until on Friday. The Engineers are the
  uncrowned masters of misdirection and red tape in the
  Technocracy. But they can also speed things up, turn an otherwise
  inefficient bureaucracy into a efficient work force. Somehow, a
  proposal passes without anybody noticing. Long lost documents and
  regulations are found again. An efficient and slightly ruthless
  person is appointed as chairman.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the Engineers use Spheres, they would probably focus on
  Mind and Correspondence. Their Mind is geared towards the
  control, manipulation and creation of large administrative
  structures. There are rumours that the Engineers have developed
  rotes to mentally control their organisations. There are even
  rumours about Engineers merging somehow with their organisations.
  They are also very interested in overcoming problems with
  communications and logistics, often using their Correspondence to
  view what is going on.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Philosophy
   </h2>
   We strive to build a society where everybody
  is equal and solidarically cooperate. Everybody will be protected
  and supported by the state. To achieve this obviously desirable
  goal, we are creating a great administrative structure to supply
  every need. When we are completed, our administration will be
  able to handle any reasonable request in the most efficient way
  possible.
   <h2>
    Quote
   </h2>
   "The submitted proposal do not conform to the
  current regulations, and can not be evaluated by the commission
  until it has been either resubmitted in a form conforming to the
  regulations, or been approved for non-standard evaluation by the
  relevant committee due to emergency reasons as defined in the
  standard regulations."
   <h2>
    Organisation
   </h2>
   The Engineers are intensely aware of
  organisation. They are organised as an enormous bureaucracy,
  consisting of innumerable commissions, divisions and departments.
  Most of these groups don't know exactly what purpose their work
  serves or what place they have in the greater whole. That doesn't
  lessen the overall efficiency of the organisation. Most members
  are sleepers and most don't even know the whole picture. Only a
  few may be awakened, if any.
   <h2>
    Meetings
   </h2>
   The Engineers meet in section meetings according
  to individual schedules, decided by a planning commission. These
  are completely like organisational meetings in any large
  administration. Much emphasis is put on the formalia, to keep the
  meetings orderly.
   <h2>
    Initiation
   </h2>
   If there are still awakened persons in this
  convention, they are probably awakened and initiated in several
  steps according to the standard procedures. First the initiate is
  studied to see if he has the correct ideology, personality and
  general suitability. If necessary, he is subtly manipulated in
  the right direction. After that step, the initiate is tested too
  see if he is loyal to the ideals of the Social Engineers and the
  concept of the Technocracy. If the initiate passes, the Engineers
  start the real initiation, and reveal the truth to him. This
  initiation consists in giving the initiate the transcendental
  experience of seeing the totality of administration of the world,
  giving him a brief glimpse of the Social Engineers vision of a
  perfect world. After that the initiate becomes trainee, and is
  given a position in the organisation.
   <h2>
    Constructs
   </h2>
   The Engineers prefer to work in their gigantic
  administrations. Most of their organisation is quite legitimate,
  and would not arouse any suspicion. Typical examples are the EEC
  bureaucracy in Brussels, parts of the Swedish government and
  several international organisations. They do not create
  constructs in the usual sense, but they have several
  organisations which tie everything together, like the Institute
  for International Economical Development (IIED), an anonymous but
  extremely influential international organisation tied closely to
  the World Bank and the UN. It is rumoured that they even have
  horizon realms housing their central bureaucracy, shaping the
  organisation on Earth.

     Like all of the New World Order they have no

    But still, there is some glimmer in their ideas of a society in
    harmony and perfection that echo our own ideas.

    in the market. They must learn that economy is just one
    important aspect of the whole of society, and start to plan
    their economies to suit the needs of the whole of society.
    Unfortunately, they currently seems to be against such needed
    changes in their organisatorial policy. This has led to several

    been avoided if they had understood our position.

    individuals.

   <h2>
    Rotes
   </h2>
   <h3>
    Curse of Kafka (Mind 2 Prime 2)
   </h3>
   The Engineer creates a
  pattern in the aura of somebody which will make bureaucrats and
  administrators subconsciously dislike the individual. This will
  lead to endless problems, as administration will start to turn
  against the victim. Documents are lost, important people are in
  meetings and secretaries happens to spell the name of the victim
  wrong. Even to fill in a form will turn into a kafkaesque
  adventure. The Engineers prefer to do this rote coincidental by
  simply putting some errors into the personal information of the
  victim.
   <h3>
    Administrative Murder (Mind 2 Correspondence 3)
   </h3>
   This is
  one of the nastiest methods of eliminating people the Engineers
  use. The victim disappears form every register, computer and
  administration in the world. Suddenly his passport is invalid,
  his bank-account doesn't exist, his apartment is marked as empty
  etc. In an administrative sense the victim has ceased to exist,
  and have never existed. There is no way he can prove he is the
  person he claims to be. Of course, using this rote
  indiscriminately would be stupid, since such victims tent to make
  a fuss about it. It is mostly used by the Engineers on people
  they want to eliminate physically too, to prevent too many to
  notice their absence too much. They also use it to remove any
  traces of persons who have "disappeared" or as an warning (in
  this case the person "reappears" into the system after a while).
  The Engineers perform this rote coincidentally by spreading some
  misinformation to the relevant registers, form where it will
  spread.
   <br>
    [ If the Engineer responsible keep the rote up, he can make the
  memory of the person start to fade too (or use Mind 4 to remove
  the memory completely). On the positive side of this rote is the
  fact that the victim gains as many dots in Arcane as the number
  of successes, on tracking by bureaucratic means. ]
    <h3>
     Pulse of the Administrator (Mind 3 Correspondence 3)
    </h3>
    The
  Engineer extend his awareness into his organisation. He is able
  to see what is going on everywhere inside it, the state of every
  project, all information contained inside it and everything else.
  In effect, they can influence everything on an extremely subtle
  level. Many Engineers subconsciously use this rote daily to keep
  in touch with their work. They slowly merge their consciousness,
  and turn more and more into spokespeople for the organisation
  itself. This rote is often coincidental, as the mage seems to be
  just an exceptionally efficient employee who knows almost
  everything needed, and makes the best possible use of the
  information network of the organisation.
    <h3>
     Omnipresence (Mind 5 Correspondence 3)
    </h3>
    The Engineer
  merges completely with an organisation, effectively becoming its
  consciousness. He will influence everything from the employees to
  the feeling of the locals. All information and control will be in
  his hands. It is guessed that most Masters among this convention
  end like this. Organisations controlled in this way are extremely
  dangerous, as they in effect are able to use extremely subtle
  coincidental magick against their enemies, and are able to
  coordinate their resources in uncannily efficient ways.
  Fortunately, these organisations tend to act rather slowly.
