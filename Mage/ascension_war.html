      Why the Ascension War is Still a Cold
  War
     </span>
    </b>
    <br>
     <br>
      Most everyone knows about how the Cold War ran, between 1945 and
  the late 1980s. THere were periods of conflict and confrontation,
  with large amounts of covert operations, psychological warfare,
  etc. Both sides, while technically "good guys" to their own
  people, committed atrocities against their own people and those
  who lived i the embattled, marginal regions where the two
  superpowers fought their battles.
     </br>
    </br>
   </p>
   <p>
    What kept the Cold War from growing into a Hot War? Simple.
  The doctrine of Mututally Assured Destruction was in operation
  the whole time. If one power acted too openly or too hostilely,
  the other would retalliate with a strike that would assure, not
  victory, but a counterstrike of proportions that would eventually
  destroy the entire world in a ball of nuclear flame.
    <br>
     <br>
      This same principle applies in spades to the Ascension War. The
  battle is at the core for the minds of the Sleepers, so anything
  that destroys all the Sleepers is unacceptible. And since most
  Sleepers are as human as magi, anything that tried to attack magi
  directly would also hurt the Sleeper population, and make the
  Ascension War revolve around more prominent, specific targets.
  Most of whom would die in the conflict for their own minds.

   <p>
    There are really three major factions in the Ascension War,
  each of them splintered into several smaller groups that have
  their own agendas, and act subtlely against even their
  "allies".
   </p>
   <p class="c6">
    <span class="c5">
     The Traditions
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    The Traditions are what the players of the game are the most
  familiar with, the "downtrodden magi" of old that have been
  displaced by an increasingly ordered universe. THey have the
  power of (sorry for the pun) tradition and history behind them,
  and many of their oldest magi are the most powerful by far. They
  can almost be equated to the NATO powers of the Cold War.
   </p>
   <p class="c6">
    <span class="c5">
     The Technocracy
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    The original" bad guys," the Technocracy has engineered the
  current structuring of the Tellurian, and have been ascendant for
  the last 300 years or so. They are rife with corruption and
  power-lust, however, the luxuries of the victorious, though they
  have not yet won. They are analogous (in history as well as
  current situation) to the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact
  nations.
   </p>
   <p class="c6">
    <span class="c5">
     The Nephandi
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    The stereotypical "bad guys", they run in the shadows, with
  their own agenda. They are the "alien power" that is feared by
  all those in the "established order", and every effort is made to
  root them out at all levels. They have no real analogue to a
  power in the Cold War, but could be considerd to be analogous to
  international crime syndicates, or illuminati-like secret
  societies.

        The Marauders
       </span>
      </b>
     </br>
    </br>
   </p>
   <p>
    Every war has those elements which act to do nothing but sow
  chaos throughout the battlefield. This is the place of the
  Marauders the ultimate anarchists in the Ascesion War. They have
  no discernable goal, simply a broad collection of individuals
  under a convenient handle. If they worked together, given their
  advantages, they would be a formidable force indeed.
   </p>
   <p>
    So, what keeps them in check?

     Magical Analogues to the Nuclear
  Bomb
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    The big thing that kept the Cold War in check was the concept
  of Mutually Assured Destruction. This doctrine kept the Cold War
  from erupting into a long-term state of madness and bloodshed.
  There are several forces that can be brought to bear by each side
  that would be analogous to the strike and counterstrike of
  nuclear weapons.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     The Traditions' Bomb
    </b>
    : Dynamic Magic
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Fallout
    </b>
    : Paradox Storm, Sleeper Backlash
   </p>
   <p>
    The Traditions have the awesome powers of dynamic magic at
  their disposal. Creating fire-breathing dragons, great firey
  explosions, and even reversing the flow of time is nothing to the
  great powers within the Traditions. Were they capable of acting
  with a united front, however, this would surely be the weapon of
  choice.
   </p>
   <p>
    The drawback, of course, is the danger of Paradox. Such
  incredible displays of dynamicism would at first be met by huge
  backlashes of Paradox, the sort that has not been seen in ages.
  These paradox storms would lash out, consuming the ofending mage
  and everything around them, tearing through the Tellurian and
  detroying or changing everything in its path.
   </p>
   <p>
    Also, with the return of true magic, the Sleepers would in
  general react in fear (the Pogrom has done its job well), afraid
  of these new super-men. They would rise up, and the Traditions,
  deprived of many of their most potent members, would be smashed
  by the wrath of the Sleeping masses.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     The Technocracy's Bomb
    </b>
    : The Pogrom
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Fallout
    </b>
    : Sealing of the Gauntlet, Sleeper Backlash
   </p>
   <p>
    The power of the Technocracy has lain in its almost iron grip
  on the modern paradigm. Their control has been slipping slightly,
  but it is still quite strong. It would take littl efor them to
  exert their combined force and escalate the Pogrom, consuming all
  the Tradition mages, and changing the paradigm enough to slam
  shut the Gauntlet, untethering Gaia from the Tellurian.
   </p>
   <p>
    The problem with this, however, is that there would be no more
  Quint. Their own magics would fail, and eventually the world
  would stagnate, patterns slowly decaying as Quint bleeds off into
  the environment, through the small magical acts of the
  near-Awakened. The end of the world in this case would be a
  series of crystaline crypts containing consciousnesses with no
  capability for thought.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Sleepers would see this assault on religious and spiritual
  laders, and eventually rise up against those that oppress them.
  The mobs would be like nothing seen before, as there would be an
  Inquisition launched spontaneously against the creators of
  technology, the controllers of the masses. And with no
  supernatural force to guide them, they would run roughshod over
  the world.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     The Nephandi's Bomb
    </b>
    : Physical
  Manifestation/Summoning
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Fallout
    </b>
    : Consumption
   </p>
   <p>
    The dread weaponof the Nephandi is the physical presence of
  their dark Lords in this Realm. Such creatures of darkness would
  consume everything in their path, destroying all, leaving
  nothing, not even entropy, in their wake. Their enemies would be
  destroyed, yes... But in their wake there would be nothing. Gaia
  would be cast screaming into the Void.
   </p>
   <p>
    Any one group has within it the power to end the Ascension
  War... But they cannot use this power. Only once they can weaken
  the power of the other two factions enough to assert themselves
  slowly over the paradigm, they can do nothing but skulk i the
  shadows, relying on propoganda, surgical strikes, and decade-long
  actions and campaigns to slowly shift and twist the Sleepers to
  believe in the way they wish, to begin to favor one faction over
  the others. Then and only then could one player push an overt bid
  for power. The problem would be the that the factions within that
  player would splinter out, and instead of one player, there would
  be a large number more, who would fight until they too settled
  into a "cold war" of their own.
   </p>
   <p>
    The danger, however, comes from the other powers, the Jyhad of
  the undead, the apparent mad assault by the Garou, the
  reality-shattering abilities of the Marauders, the almost
  untouchable influence of the dead, and the capricious,
  unpredictable nature of the Fae. Actions by those powers will
  keep the Ascension War on the edge of a thaw, time held
  constantly at the point two minutes to the archetypical midnight,
  the last bit of the 11th hour.

      Well, that's long-winded, and I didn't even get into the
  interplay between the various factions within, or how the
  vampires, garou, etc. have been changing the Ascension War and
  complicating everyone's lives.

     <p class="c8">
      And no, running a Chronicle with this kind of
  assertion is NOT easy.... But when its done. it can be an
  INCREDIBLE amount of fun, and a very involving storyline... It's
  like plucking at a strand of a spider's web... You never know
  when you're going to pull the thread that gets you bit.
