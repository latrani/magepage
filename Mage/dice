Mr. Dice

Mr. Dice is a legend among Euthanatos and mortals alike. He is the gambler
who appears from the unknown, and gambles with people for their lives - or
souls. In fact, many of the myths about desperate people playing chess
with the grim reaper for more life or how the devil sometimes tries to
snare gamblers probably stem from Mr. Dice¹s activities through history.
He is old, older than anybody remembers, and very powerful. 

Mr. Dice doesn¹t look that out of the ordinary; a weathered man of
indeterminate age with a wrinkled poker face and hard eyes. He wears
slightly faded and worn clothes and speaks with a soft, yet clear, voice.
He is never noticed until he wants to, usually when he appears for some
gambling. He smoothly enters ongoing games, and after a short while the
others feel as if he had been with them since they started. The games
usually become much more absorbing when he participates, like professional
gamblers he avoids being noticeable successful or suffer from extreme
swings of luck. 

However, sometimes he singles out a player, usually a successful gambler
or the host, but sometimes a completely random person.  Soon the game will
be between Mr Dice and the player; everybody else will back down and just
watch the game as the stakes slowly gets higher and higher. Mr. Dice is
very good at subtly egging on his opponent, the game itself seems to come
alive and *demand* greater dedication from the participants, until nothing
else matters;  the whole room slowly fills with cigarette smoke and takes
on a dreamlike quality. Many witnesses have afterwards confessed that it
all seemed like a gambler¹s dream. 

Finally the game reaches its climax, unless the player have somehow
resisted the spell and ended the game voluntarily. It is now the stakes
goes beyond the normal, and become a matter of life and death. Sometimes
players bet their lives or souls, or something even more important to
them. Mr Dice is fair, and bets something of equal value. The final round
is actually played without any magickal influence, it is just a matter of
luck and skill, but Mr Dice is *very* skilled. Afterwards, the game is
over. 

In 1943, Mr Dice played with professional gambler ²Ten Star² Gorane in Los
Angeles for his luck. Gorane lost. Beside gambling with mortals Mr Dice
has also played against many other players. It is known that he once
participated in a game of poker against an unnamed Methuselah visiting Las
Vegas; nobody know what the ancient vampire lost, only that it returned
into the desert it came from. He also succeeded in winning an unnamed but
very treasured tome from Master Euronicus of Growald sometime in the 15th
century; the Master took the loss of the tome so hard that he isolated
himself in his room for five years until finally emerging. 

Few others understand Mr. Dice, not even his fellow Euthanatos.  Actually,
he doesn¹t understand himself completely either, so it doesn¹t matter. He
is definitely a bit insane, and cannot resist any chance to gamble.
Gambling and games are his life, and he can¹t exist without them. It is
through these games he strives for the ultimate jackpot, Ascension, and
the way to free others from their limitations and illusions. If a player
succeeds in ending the game when he is breaking even or ahead, he deserves
his wins and will forever remember that he could stop. But if he cannot
resist the lure of the Big Win, then he will face the ultimate gamble and
risk loosing everything. What few people realise is that Mr Dice also
faces the ultimate gamble himself all the time. 

Magickally, Mr Dice is very powerful. He is definitely a Master of
Entropy, and very skilled in Mind, Time and Correspondence. But his magick
is subtle and does not affect anything directly; he seems to influence all
of reality around himself so that nothing seems out of place when he plays
his games. One should also never forget that his gambling skills are quite
real; he is probably the most skilled gambler alive.
