  <hr>
   They're known across the world to fans of magic and horror as
  masters of gore and prestidigitation, so gruesome that children
  are not allowed to attend. The Midnight Cabaret regularly tours
  across small clubs in America and occasionally to other parts of
  the globe, especially in England, France, and Germany. The
  illusionists of the Cabaret confuse the senses of the audience,
  and corrupts their very souls.
   <p>
    <b>
     Background:
    </b>
    The Midnight Cabaret was formed during the
  early 1980's, by the meeting of a Hermetic barabbi named Phillip
  Harding, and the Hollow One barabbi, Morlock, at a Nephandi
  coven. The two talked and soon formed a dark unity. By combining
  the Hermetic's interest in corruption of the masses, the Orphan's
  love for bloodshed and gore, and a mutual hobby of stage magic
  they conceived the idea of the "Midnight Cabaret, the Dark Magics
  of the World Revealed!"
   </p>
   <p>
    The two unlikely partners soon formed a small gathering of
  loyal Disciples, Consorts, and Acolytes from the population of
  Nephandi on Earth, and a few from beyond, from the darkest parts
  of the Umbra. They began their tours, always careful to maintain
  a high level of caution in their acts so as to escape detection
  from both the Traditions and the Technocracy. They began to
  become quite popular in select circles, and it was this small
  fame that led other Nephandi to contact them. Some would join as
  members of the Midnight Cabaret, some would try to wrest control
  of the Cabaret, and some would try to destroy the Cabaret
  entirely, but the show went on nonetheless.
   </p>
   <p>
    In 1987 the Cabaret was infiltrated by a NWO agent known as
  Mr. Wells, but the spy had been slowly turning to the ways of the
  Nephandi long before he had joined the Cabaret. In fact, spy
  revealed himself to Morlock and Harding almost immediately,
  feeding his NWO superiors false information on the Cabaret so as
  to better protect it, a situation that will inevitably be
  discovered by his supervisors in the NWO.
   </p>
   <p>
    In 1992 the Cabaret came under heavy attack by a cabal of Cult
  of Ecstasy mages after one of their performances. The Cabaret
  suffered many losses, but Mr. Wells turned in the information on
  the Ecstasy mages along with evidence showing the Cultists to be
  responsible for several magickal disturbances in the area (which
  were actually the result of the Cabaret), leading to the
  Cultists' enslavement in MECHA.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Cabaret has just recently been able to fully recover, and
  its plans are growing in scope.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Acts:
   </h2>
   The Midnight Cabaret uses all manner of bizarre
  magic tricks and elaborate sets, but it also presents members of
  its "Freak Gallery", and wonders from its "Cabinet of
  Curiosities." Many of the creatures and items presented would
  have been destroyed by Paradox long ago, if it weren't for the
  fact that the Cabaret mages siphon Quintessence to feed the dark
  hungers of their freaks and curios, as well as the fact that
  audiences expect the existence of such things when they go to
  visit the Cabaret. Within the Cabinet of Curiosities are many
  items of torture and death. Included among them is the guillotine
  claimed to have been used to behead Marie Antoinette, an iron
  maiden used in the execution of over 300 men and women, the
  crucifix of Rasputin, and a supposedly unknown painting by
  Hieronymus Bosch. In total the Cabinet consists of over two
  hundred odd items from around the world and different parts of
  history. Many historians and antiques dealers scoff at the
  possibility of the items being authentic, but the majority of
  them are later seen offering enormous sums for their purchase.
   <p>
    [In fact, many of these are authentic artifacts, with
  stagehands giving accurate representations of their histories.
  They are always surrounded by a Mind 2 effect, driving audience
  onlookers to become obsessed with the object, even to the point
  of stealing it. Once taken, the object begins to show its darker
  side.]
   </p>
   <p>
    One of the more commonly seen freaks is the Masochist. Wearing
  nothing but a g-string, he walks amongst the audience of the
  Cabaret, pins run through both sides of his neck, staples run all
  along his inner arms, and needles piercing the entire surface of
  his legs. For some shows the Masochist has been known to allow
  people in the audience to insert foot long needles into his
  stomach as far as the "stabber" can handle. Many are squeamish at
  first about the idea, but with the Masochist's persistence they
  soon find the concept amusing and many will run the entire needle
  through the man's body. Sometimes the Masochist will choose a
  person to stick smaller needles through the pupils of his
  eyes.
   </p>
   <p>
    [By using Mind 2 magicks, the Masochist slowly reduces his
  audience's reluctance towards inflicting pain. An important
  feature in later "acts."]
   </p>
   <p>
    Elsewhere, sitting on a small throne in a huge open box, is a
  man nearly buried by maggots, for he is the Maggot King. A
  thalidomide baby, the Maggot King has mere stumps for arms and
  legs, but his mind is gifted beyond that of any normal sleeper,
  as he seems to have the power to command the maggots to move and
  obey him. The Cabaret makes no claims as to how this is done,
  merely saying that the audience may judge for themselves how such
  a freak can stand to live. Oftentimes the audience will begin to
  snicker at, or ridicule the Maggot King, especially after he's
  bent over and eaten a mouth full of his "subjects."
   </p>
   <p>
    [Again, the use of Mind 2 magicks make the audience feel
  superior and arrogant, often leading them to ridicule the
  King.]
   </p>
   <p>
    Among the magic acts, a popular trick is the "Resurrection!"
  Typically, Harding will select a subject from the audience,
  usually attractive and female, and ask her to step up on stage.
  Once on stage, Harding will blindfold her, pull a sword out from
  behind the curtain, and run her through the stomach. Many in the
  audience will begin to scream as the subject falls to the floor,
  blood flowing from her mouth. But Harding will command them to be
  silent, and will remove the blindfold, snap his fingers, and the
  subject's eyes will open as if nothing has happened.
   </p>
   <p>
    [In this case, the subject
    <em>
     is
    </em>
    slain, and her body
  possessed by the Nephandi spirit, Xane (described below). Also,
  another Mind 2 effect is used to continually reduce the
  audience's mental blocks against committing murder and acts of
  violence. In this case, Harding chooses females so as to increase
  the idea of acceptability towards violence against women.]
   </p>
   <p>
    Morlock has also been known to stage an act he calls Parting
  of the Vapors. To begin the act, the room is filled with a thick
  fog, through which the audience can barely see. Then Morlock
  warns the audience, and begins chanting in ancient Sumerian. Soon
  the first of the wailings can be heard, faint at first, but
  growing in number. As the wails become clearer, the room fills
  with a multitude of spectral images of maimed people. Some sit in
  chairs, some rest upon members of the audience. Then, Morlock
  will scream at the spirits, telling them they must leave, but
  instead the spirits will began to yell and act as if they will
  devour the audience. At the last moment the lights will turn on,
  and the spirits will be gone.
   </p>
   <p>
    [In actuality, the Sumerian, the fog, and the commanding of
  the spirits are all fake. In fact, Morlock has a small stable of
  spirits under his command which desire nothing more than to
  corrupt the souls of the living. When enacting this performance,
  Morlock will use Mind 2 and 3 magicks so as to weaken the mental
  resolve of the victims in the audience, allowing for greater ease
  of possession and corruption.]
   </p>
   <p>
    Harding's favorite act, the Prophet, is one of the darkest
  performances ever seen. At the beginning, Harding warns the
  audience that they are about to see an act of erotic, almost
  pornographic extremes, and that they may leave if they feel like
  it. Of course, by this time into the act the audience hungers for
  more mystery and carnage, and few have the desire to leave. A
  naked woman is brought onto the stage, seemingly hypnotized, and
  laid upon a simple, uncovered table. From behind the curtain a
  man, wearing only a hood, enters the stage and walks up to the
  woman's face. Some in the audience expect an oral sex show at
  this point, but what happens is even more bizarre as the man
  begins to move his arm down the woman's throat.
   </p>
   <p>
    The show proceeds slowly, as the man puts more and more of his
  body into the woman, over a period of what seems like hours.
  After the man has completely entered the woman, her stomach
  begins to swell, larger and larger, until finally the man can be
  seen emerging from between her legs, covered in the blood of his
  "rebirth." On top of this horror is added the fact that the man
  is no longer purely human, but instead has become something else.
  And the woman lay motionless on the table.
   </p>
   <p>
    [Besides fulfilling Harding's perverse lusts, this act also
  allows for the rebirth of a person into a Nephandi. In this case,
  the woman (usually a prostitute or a vagrant) is drugged, and
  ritually prepared to house the Caul of the Cabaret, so that the
  recipient is truly reborn a Nephandi. The reborn are also
  "blessed" with gifts from the Wyrm, and added to the ever-growing
  number of freaks. As if this wasn't enough, Mind magicks are
  again used to promote more atrocity in the minds of the viewers
  as they watch the bizarre murder/birth scene.]
   </p>
   <p>
    The Cabaret also performs magic acts of a more mundane sort,
  but always with the addition of some shockingly graphic element,
  and always some new twist. Common acts include the classical
  sawing a woman in half, only using a chainsaw and up the middle.
  Another common act is for Harding or Morlock to be split into
  thirds, and then have the individual sections move separate from
  one another, usually with each section holding onto a tokens
  taken from three members of the audience. The image of a man
  split into thirds and scrambled between three different areas of
  the stage while each section fiddles with an item belonging to an
  audience member can be highly disturbing. And of course, all acts
  use enormous amounts of gore and bile. Not all of which is
  fake.
   </p>
   <p>
    [The Cabaret often performs these more "mundane" acts when
  under suspected Technocracy observation, or just to impress the
  masses. When they feel safe, the Cabaret will continue to use
  it's magicks to corrupt the minds and souls of the masses, as
  well as to perform spectacular acts of prestidigitation.]
   </p>

    <b>
     Members:
    </b>
    Currently the Midnight Cabaret contains 23
  members, including 12 stage hands. Morlock (Master) and Phillip
  Harding (Master) currently lead the Cabaret, with Mr. Wells
  (Master) as a consultant. Among their "freaks" are the Masochist
  (Disciple), the Maggot King (Adept), the Bottled Child
  (Disciple), the Trinity (Adepts), Gertrude (Acolyte), the Knight
  Errant (Adept), the Tiger Warrior (Acolyte), and the Window on
  the Human Machine. All are ruthless and deadly. Also, the
  Midnight Cabaret has a small collection of fetishes and other
  items infused with demonic energies, including the "lost dagger,"
  an unknown painting by Hieronymus Bosch titled "The Abyss," and
  the ax of Lizzy Borden.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Fetishes:
   </h2>
   <b>
    The Lost Dagger (***):
   </b>
   The lost dagger
  is known only among a few weapons historians, as a strangely
  designed blade that formed triangular wounds in its victims. The
  blade, however, over the course of three dozen murders and nearly
  two centuries the blade could never be found. Unknown to all but
  Harding and Morlock, the blade contains the spirit of an evil
  woman who sought revenge on her husband, and made this knife to
  kill him with. In the struggle of their fight she was killed and
  her soul became trapped in the blade. Now she works for the
  Cabaret, letting herself be stolen and forcing her "owner" to
  kill those close to him.
   <p>
    [The dagger has a damage of STR+2 (aggravated), and a
  difficulty of 5. The blade causes its "owner" to start feeling
  that his loved ones are going to betray him, and that they must
  be killed (Mind 2). When the owner attacks, he feels as if the
  blade guides him towards the victim's weakest area (Entropy 1).
  And then, once the blade has corrupted its "owner" into killing,
  it returns itself to the Cabaret (Correspondence 3).]
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     The Ax of Lizzy Borden (****):
    </b>
    The ax belonging to the
  Cabaret is not the real ax used by Miss Borden to kill her
  parents, but it is very valuable nonetheless. Engraved along the
  blade is two images: on one side a frail child is being beaten by
  a pair of adults, on the other side the child has grown into a
  woman and stands triumphantly with ax in her hand, over the
  fallen adults. Eventually, the ax will reveal that it possesses
  power, and the owner will soon try to harness that power for
  himself.
   </p>
   <p>
    [The ax has a damage of STR+5 (aggravated), and a difficulty
  of 7. Whenever the blade takes a life, the wielder will feel
  rejuvenated, and gain a year of life of his life back (Life 3).
  The ax also gives its wielder a burst of speed, allowing him to
  act as if he were full of energy (Time 2). When being attacked,
  the ax will harden the flesh of the wielder (Life 4), and allow
  the wielder to perceive all of his immediate surroundings
  (Correspondence 1). Of course, once the Cabaret comes to reclaim
  its ax, the spirit within removes any assistance it had been
  giving its wielder. Often the wielder will swing the ax at the
  Cabaret collector, only to find the ax sap away the wielder's
  strength altogether.]
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     The Abyss (??????):
    </b>
    Of all the curios in the Cabinet of
  Curiosities, only the Abyss remains a mystery to all. Harding
  sensed the power in the item when he first saw it among a
  collection of items belonging to a traveling albino mage. While
  Harding desired many of the items the albino had, Harding was
  tricked into spending all of his available funds on this one
  item. A purchase Harding wonders if he should regret or not.
   </p>
   <p>
    The painting is often placed by itself, and is five foot by
  foot in size. Set against a black background, the Abyss consists
  of an inwardly spiraling staircase that descends into darkness as
  all manner of malformed creatures climb from obscurity in the
  bottom of the painting to the top of the staircase. As one stares
  at the painting, the creatures almost seem to be escaping from
  the painting as they hungrily look at the observer.
   </p>
   <p>
    [Harding has tried to determine what powers lay within the
  painting, but all he has been able to determine so far is that
  the painting seems to contain Nephandi spirits or open onto an
  Umbral realm full of the creatures. Harding speculates that
  either Bosch meant the painting as a prison, trapping the
  creatures and the portal they were using to access Gaia. Or else
  Bosch created a portal for the creatures to use to enter Gaia.
  Harding would pay much to know what the painting was, and who the
  albino boy he bought the painting from was.]

    A brown-haired man in his twenties, the
  Masochist tends to keep his hair shaved in a crew-cut. When not
  performing, he typically wears button-up shirts and slacks. The
  Masochist always wears a Rolex, whether performing or not.

  house aflame, and ran away with some of his friends. While

     Rote:
    </b>
    The Maggot King has a peculiar ritual, he calls
  "Greetings." When his enemies sleep, the Maggot King sends
  thousands of his followers to swarm across the subject, as his
  will forces them to stay asleep and dream of being eaten alive.
  By morning the followers of the Maggot King will have found a new
  breeding ground and food for thousands more.
   </p>
   <p>
    [By using Correspondence 2, the Maggot King locates his
  target. He then creates a swarm of maggots on top of the target
  (Correspondence 2, Life 3, Prime 2), while forcing the target to
  stay asleep (Mind 2). For every success the King rolls on his
  Life sphere the subject takes two wound levels, which can be
  soaked. The target is also forced to sleep, but the sleep can be
  resisted by a Willpower roll with a target number of 8, and more
  successes than the King rolls. This rote is highly vulgar in the
  least.]

    As part of his cover, Mr. Wells dress like a
  punk, and wear "Pinky and the Brain" t-shirts underneath a
  leather jacket. He tends to keep his hair cut short, but dyed in
  a neon green color as part of his "cover". Mr. Wells always seems
  cold and distant, even when around Harding and Morlock.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Background:
    </b>
    All that the Cabaret truly knows is that
  Mr. Wells approached them, claiming to be a Virtual Adept at
  first. He soon told Harding and Morlock of his NWO agenda after
  realizing the power they possessed, and how they could help him
  in his path to corruption. Harding and Morlock were suspicious of
  the double-agent, until he willingly underwent rebirth during a
  staging of the Prophet during a stage performance. Since then Mr.
  Wells has proven to be a loyal member, feeding the Technocracy
  false information and getting Technocratic support in extreme
  emergencies of a supernatural nature.

    <b>
     Role-Playing Notes:

  learn the secrets of the Cabaret, and make plans for what to do
  when the Pogrom comes after the Cabaret and you.

    Morlock looks like a white man, in his twenties,
  who always dresses in either a gothic cape and black suit (when
  performing), or else in red and brown jeans and shirts (when off
  stage). Morlock's hair is dyed white, with faint wisps of black
  (his natural color) at the roots.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Background:
    </b>
    Morlock has been walking the streets since
  at least the 1950's. The only thing he's changed has been his
  hair color. Drugs, ritual sacrifice, prostitution, Morlock's
  always been seeking to entertain the Masses by feeding their
  dark-lusts. Morlock has been making a small name for himself
  among the community of prestidigitation and night-clubs in
  America and Europe. Morlock is always seen with a new lady, his
  "play thing of the hour" as he calls them. And after he's had his
  way, he usually gives them over to Harding for some fun.

    Make the fools do what you want. If
  they have something, anything, that you want, be their friend and
  buddy. Help them out, and then take it from them. Whatever it may
  be. Of course, you'd never do that to the others in the Cabaret.
  At worst they're your co-workers and at best you genuinely
  consider them your friends, especially Harding and Wells.

     Role-Playing Notes:

    You're here on a sabbatical of
  sorts. Corruption and destruction is fine and all, but you needed
  a vacation for a while. The Cabaret was just the place you were
  looking for; it combines spiritual decay and degradation with
  simple acts of entertainment. You'd almost be in love with
  Harding if he didn't hate women so. Before you leave, make sure
  to seduce him into giving you his love and
    <em>
     then
    </em>
    move
  on.

    Phillip Harding never smiles. Ever. An
  emotionless man in his early fifties, Harding is always dressed
  in the newest and most expensive fashions. Harding is always
  spotlessly clean, and his movements seem almost mechanical in
  their efficient expenditure of energy. Harding would seem to be
  ideal material for Iteration X, if it weren't for the fact that
  the man is thoroughly vile and corrupted by the Wyrm.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Background:
    </b>
    Harding can't remember. He knows that he
  lost a battle to a woman in the Umbra who called herself Vera,
  and that he was once much more powerful and knowledgeable. But
  that is all he can remember from before 1968. Harding has spent
  the years since then relearning, and growing in power, intent on
  finding out who Vera is, and what role she played in his life.
  And then he shall kill her.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Role-Playing Notes:
    </b>
    Never let them know what you feel.
  You always keep a part of your mind chanting incantations to
  protect your thoughts just to be safe. Always act as emotion-less
  as possible, to better hide your true thoughts from the others.
  You are driven by four desires: you seek power over others,
  knowledge of your past, the death of Vera (whoever she may be),
  the corruption of the masses, and brutalization of women to
  avenge your loss to Vera.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Tactics:
   </h2>
   The Cabaret works as a team of individuals. Each
  member tends to do their own thing, with Masochist and Mr. Wells
  using Mind Magicks to demoralize the enemy while the others go
  for more direct attacks. After a conflict, Mr. Wells will call
  upon his contacts in the NWO and have the Pogrom called against
  any survivors. As if this wasn't enough, each freak will take a
  pair of stagehands to respond to less threatening scenarios (such
  as the reclaiming of "borrowed" curios, and collection of
  sacrifices).
   <p>
    The Midnight Cabaret values subtlety and secrecy above all
  else. Their magicks are coincidental whenever possible, and will
  not risk discovery for the sake of a dozen souls. The Cabaret
  uses certain tactics depending on its location. In cities the
  Cabaret works coincidental magicks, and settles for the
  corruption of the items it displays. In the countryside, the
  cabaret has been known to become quite vulgar, and its members
  become an almost common sight in the nearby towns. Wherever they
  go however, the Cabaret is careful to perform only in
  out-of-the-way, hidden places, away from hostile eyes. And after
  a week or so, the Cabaret packs up it belongings and moves to a
  new location.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Story Ideas:
   </h2>
   1) The players hear of a bizarre new magic
  show, where the performers are suspected of being Awakened. While
  at opening night for the act, Morlock begins his Parting of the
  Vapors act, and summons a horde of spirits from beyond. Perhaps
  the spirits prove beyond Morlock's control, and attack everyone
  in the audience. Another, more menacing possibility, is that one
  of the spirits "adopts" a PC, following him and whispering acts
  of evil into his ear.
   <p>
    2) A friend or love one of a PC went to the Cabaret, and never
  returned. The PCs, after a small bit of checking, learn of the
  Cabaret and how it performs brutal acts of violence and torture
  in its magic shows. The PCs, suspecting the Cabaret of somehow
  being behind the disappearance, seek out the Cabaret for some
  answers.
   </p>
   <p>
    Of course, the Cabaret could be an innocent red-herring in
  this one case. The loved one may have been struck by car and
  placed in a hospital, unable to contact the PC. So that by the
  time the PCs discover that the Cabaret is innocent, Harding and
  Morlock will have ordered the PCs destruction.
   </p>
   <p>
    3) (Only for use after you've milked the Cabaret for
  everything you can) The PCs are after them, most likely with
  Technocracy allies (the alliance ends with the defeat of the
  Nephandi). As if this wasn't enough, the Marauders and other
  Nephandi have decided to take a shot at besting the Cabaret. Even
  others among the Traditions and Technocracy are after the Cabaret
  as a source of power and information. To buy themselves time, the
  Cabaret has discarded numerous amounts of its items and
  human/demon creations along the path of their pursuants.
   </p>
   <p>
    The PCs and their allies have to deal with many things. Will
  they allow the Progenitors to capture the freaks alive for later
  study and dissection (does even a Nephandi deserve that?)
  Hermetics and Syndicate mages scramble to collect the valuable,
  powerful talismans of darkness and antiquity. The Nephandi and
  Marauders may appear at any time, attacking any faction, trying
  to seize as much as they can from their competitors. And maybe
  that albino will come looking for the Bosch painting he sold
  Harding....
