   Here's something I started to write a month ago. It's starting
  to look like I'll never finish it, so I decided to post what I
  have written so far. The references in the text to the Goetic
  mages are in fact direct quotes from Anders Sandberg's writing on
  those mages. His writings have been a general inspiration for
  this piece, but his influences are too numerous to mention.
  Thanks for your good work on Mage, Anders.

   <h2>
    Spirits
   </h2>
   A
   <em>
    spirit
   </em>
   refers to any one of a
  multitude of denizens of the Umbra. For the most part, spirits
  are immaterial and invisible to the physical world, and do not
  directly affect it. Some spirits have the power to breach the
  gauntlet, but most only approach the physical world if called by
  a mage or other mystic. A few of the more powerful spirits have
  an interest in the physical world, and seek to effect it through
  various machinations. The variety of spirits is staggering, but
  they do all share some traits in common.
   <p>
    Spirits may be categorized by their level of power, a
  numerical value from 1 to 5 (or occasionally more). Level 1
  spirits (Lesser Minions) are pitifully weak. Level 2 spirits
  (Minions) are on par with a normal human or an apprentice mage.
  Level 3 spirits (Lesser Preceptors) are the equal of a Disciple
  mage. Level 4 (Preceptors) spirits equal Adepts in power, while
  Level 5 and above (Lords) equal or exceed Master mages. These
  power levels correspond to those given in the book of Chantries.
  The level determines the spirit's general abilities as
  follows:
   </p>
   <p>
    All the spirit's Attributes, including Arete, equal its level.
  The spirit's Willpower is its level + 3. The spirit has a number
  of skills equal to its level, whose ratings are 2 (if its level
  is 1 to 2), 3 (if its level is 3 to 4) or 4 (if its level is 5 to
  6) and so on. The spirit has a number of spheres equal to its
  level of power, each of whose rating equals its level of power,
  e.g. a level 3 spirit has 3 spheres rated at level 3.
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Attributes = Level
    </li>
    <li>
     Arete = Level
    </li>
    <li>
     Willpower = Level + 3
    </li>
    <li>
     (Level) Skills, rating 2 (Level 1-2), 3 (Level 3-4) or 4
    (Level 5-6)
    </li>
    <li>
     (Level) Spheres at rating = Level
    </li>
   </ul>
   The spirit may be "customized" by switching points around
  within a given category. Thus, a Level 3 spirit might have
  Strength 2, Dexterity 5 and Stamina 2 (1 point moved from each of
  Strength and Stamina to Dexterity). Furthermore, points can be
  switched between categories subject to the following
  restrictions: 2 Skill points give 1 Attribute or Willpower point,
  2 Attribute or Willpower points give 1 Sphere point, 2 Spheres
  give a point of Arete. Of course, these rules are merely
  guidelines, and the Storyteller may choose to strengthen or
  weaken the spirit beyond these ratings if desired.
   <h3>
    Spirit Spheres and Powers
   </h3>
   The spheres a spirit has do not
  represent sphere magic per se, but instead are various spirit
  powers. As such, a spirit may have sphere ratings in excess of
  its Arete score. The spirit has one Rote, or effect, per level of
  the sphere, varying from level 1 up to the maximum level of the
  sphere, e.g. a spirit with Forces 3 has 3 Forces Rotes: 1 Level
  1, 1 Level 2, and 1 Level 3. The Rotes may also be conjunctional,
  requiring several spheres, even spheres the spirit does not
  possess.
   <p>
    To use any of its powers, the spirit makes an Arete roll,
  using all the rules of mage for determine duration, range, etc.
  If the roll is botched, the spirit takes aggravated damage equal
  to the level of the power from the strain. Mages view this damage
  as the forces of Paradox ripping into the spirit. It does not
  seem to matter whether a spirit's power is "coincidental" or
  not.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Common Spirit Powers, Healing and Feeding
   </h3>
   All spirits
  have the following basic powers: Airt Sense and Reform. Airt
  Sense allows the spirit to navigate the Umbra with ease, knowing
  where it is and where it is going. Reform allows the spirit to
  heal its wounds, by dropping into an immaterial state called
  "slumber". Wounds return at a rate of one per hour. If a spirit
  is "killed" by losing all its wounds, it immediately
  dematerializes into slumber, until it is completely healed eight
  or so hours later. Thus, it is a major feat to permanently
  destroy a spirit.
   <p>
    Spirits take aggravated damage from all the usual sources
  (natural weapons of supernatural creatures, prime charged vulgar
  magick, etc). Aggravated damage returns at a rate of one per day
  of slumber. Weaker spirits may be permanently destroyed by
  aggravated damage, but strong spirits often reform eventually
  (though it may take months or years). Most spirits have the usual
  7 wound levels, though weaker ones may have less, the larger ones
  more. Unlike physical creatures, spirits do not suffer from wound
  penalties.
   </p>
   <p>
    All spirits have the ability to feed on Quintessence. Each
  point of Quintessence allows them to instantly heal a
  (non-aggravated) wound. Spirits may also store extra Quintessence
  in their patterns, up to their Arete rating. This Quintessence
  can be used to reduce the difficulty of their magickal effects,
  or to heal. Some magickal effects may require the spirit to
  expend its Quintessence. Many spirits have some way of feeding
  off of natural energies to gain Quintessence. This is a only
  Prime 1 power for spirits, so it is very common. Spirits feed off
  such things as human emotions, electricity or heat flows,
  accumulations of information, and so forth. A mage may also
  channel Quintessence into a spirit with a Spirit 2, Prime 3
  effect. Taking energy away from even a weak spirit is a difficult
  process, and often results in the destruction of the spirit.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Spirits in the Physical World
   </h3>
   One common and useful power
  a spirit may possess is the ability to materialize, i.e. enter
  the physical world. This is a level 3 Spirit power, so usually
  only Preceptors or more powerful spirits know it. The spirit must
  make an Arete roll to cross the gauntlet. Once across, the spirit
  manifests in a body that can interact with the physical world as
  any living creature can. While physically manifest, the spirit
  suffers from wound penalties like living creatures. If its body
  is slain, it is force back into the Umbra and immediate slumber.
   <p>
    Spirits that do not have this power cannot enter or effect the
  real world, except possibly through the use of its powers. Most
  summoned spirits will only approach the real world, refusing to
  manifest unless coerced. If the spirit is unable to materialize,
  the mage must provide it with a body of some sort, either an
  object or a living body. The mage may draw the spirit out of the
  Umbra with a Spirit 3 effect, along with appropriate
  conjunctional magick to draw it into the body. All spirits have
  material form in the Umbra, unless they are in slumber.
   </p>
   <p>
    Another common ability spirits have is possession. A spirit
  may "ride" a person (with a Mind 3 Spirit 3 effect), in which
  case the spirit travels in the persons body, is able to examine
  their victims mind, but have no control. With a Mind 4 Spirit 3
  effect, the spirit may fully possess an individual, taking
  complete control of the body. In either case, the spirit body is
  effectively that of person they are possessing, and it can be
  harmed along with its victim.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some spirits have the power to influence the physical world
  from the Umbra. These seems to be an easier task for spirits than
  mages (perhaps a mere Spirit 3 conjunctional effect). When
  spirits use such powers, they are very "close" to the physical
  world. While the spirit is not material, there is enough of a
  link to allow mages to "return fire" with magick of their own.
  Other supernatural weaponry, such as enchanted blades or werewolf
  claws, may also effect it. This applies to mages using Spirit 4
  to cast spells through the gauntlet as well.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Summoning Spirits
   </h3>
   A mage may summon a spirit with a
  Spirit 2 Rote, but the preparations for this magick may be
  elaborate. If the spirit is strongly associated with another
  sphere, this sphere must be used in a conjunctional effect to
  summon it (though Level 1 is all that is needed). The mage must
  get at least as many successes as the level of the spirit to
  summon it.
   <p>
    It is possible that the mage is unable to get the required
  number of successes to summon a spirit; this is often true of
  Umbrood Lords. If the mage gets at least half the needed number
  of successes, she will at least attract the attention of the
  desired spirit. The spirit may then come to mage of their own
  free will, or at least send some message or servant to deal with
  the mage.
   </p>
   <p>
    A summoned spirit will not arrive immediately. It may take
  some time for the spirit to travel through the Umbra to the mage.
  Generally, the closest spirit of the desired type will be the one
  to answer the call. To summon a specific spirit, the mage must
  use some token identifying the spirit, most typically its name. A
  specifically summoned spirit may take even more time to reach the
  mage, however.
   </p>
   <p>
    More powerful spirits require certain rituals and
  paraphernalia to summon, appropriate to the spirit. The more
  powerful the spirit, the greater the requirements. As a rule of
  thumb, there is one additional requirement for each level of the
  spirit beyond the first. Summoning a level 3 Fire Elemental might
  require the use of a flaming brazier in the full light of the
  sun. For each of these requirements the mage leaves out, the
  difficulty of summoning the spirit increases by 1. The Goetic
  mages (a subgroup of the Order of Hermes that deals extensively
  with spirits) make some suggestions as to what may be required to
  summon various spirits:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    "Sacrifices have always been useful, and by sacrificing
    something (or someone) the summoned being likes, the mage can
    get some extra goodwill. Blood is a traditional sacrifice for
    summoning ghosts, and many demons like sacrifices of snakes,
    cats and other living beings. Angels generally prefer aetheric
    essences, flowers or expensive balsams. Elementals love
    substances fitting to their own element (like sacrificing ambra
    or fish to undines or gasoline to salamanders). Tass is always
    a hit.
    <p>
     "Another way to ensure success is to perform the summoning
    at a place which fits the summoned beings. For summoning
    ghosts, crossroads, graveyards and haunted buildings have
    proven useful. Sylphs can be found at hilltops or any other
    place where the wind is strong. Undines are naturally summoned
    by lakes, rivers or the sea. Gnomes in caves or woods, and
    Salamanders at great fires, volcanoes or in deserts. Angels are
    of course attracted to holy places, while demons to unholy or
    pagan places. Nodes are of course very useful, especially if
    they fit any of the above types. Certain beings have their own
    preferences, like Astaroth who is more present in America than
    in Europe, or Hazthoragoth who only will appear if summoned
    inside a stone circle.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Finally, astrological means to determine time can be very
    useful. Each day in the week corresponds to one planet, and
    magick compatible with that planet will become easier (Love
    magick is for example easier on Fridays, while death magick on
    Saturday). The same is true to a lesser extent about the hours
    of the planets (each day and night is divided into twelve
    planetary hours). Other times, like full or new moon, eclipses,
    conjunctions and the equinoxes are also powerful. Some beings
    are easier to summon on certain days, like ghosts at Halloween
    and angels at Good Friday."
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   There is some evidence that the most powerful
  spirits, the Umbrood lords, cannot approach the physical world at
  all unless successfully summoned by a powerful mystic. It is said
  there are many ancient wards, recently strengthened and added to
  by the Technocracy, that prevent such powerful spirits from
  entering the Near Umbra. A successful summoning opens a gate that
  allows the lord to reach the world. Once there, the powerful
  spirit may decide to stay and look around. There are certain
  sects of mages dedicated to opening such gates to various beings
  in the Deep Umbra.
   <h3>
    Dealing with Spirits
   </h3>
   Summoning a spirit does not
  necessarily give the mage control of it. The mage must then
  coerce or cajole the spirit into doing what they want. The
  methods for dealing with spirit vary wildly, depending on the
  level of the spirit's power.
   <p>
    Minion spirits are incredibly difficult to bargain with. They
  are not very bright, and their needs are often too alien for the
  mage to understand. Most mages do not waste their time dickering
  with these weak spirits, and simply coerce them, either through
  threats or the use of various Mind/Spirit rotes to take direct
  control. There is rarely any threat from the coerced minion
  itself. Unfortunately, the abuse of weaker spirits can adversely
  effect the mage's reputation amongst the minion's more powerful
  relatives.
   </p>
   <p>
    Because of this some mages work to learn the odd desires of
  weaker spirits, to earn their trust. This is a time consuming
  process, and is rather like taming a wild animal to make them
  into a pet. Because of the time involved, most mages concentrate
  on a few "species" of spirits to cultivate. Over time, through
  small gifts and favors, the mage can build up a good enough
  reputation that the minor spirits will do tasks for the mage
  willingly. More powerful, related spirits will also be favorably
  inclined toward the mage. This reputation takes constant work to
  maintain, as the memories of spirits can be frighteningly
  short.
   </p>
   <p>
    Preceptor spirits are powerful enough to be truly useful to a
  mage, but also sufficiently strong that coercion is difficult and
  dangerous. Mages whose chose to coerce these spirits do so with
  great care, setting up elaborate protective circles, and binding
  the spirits into objects. There are many ancient texts describing
  the necessary rites and rituals to bind various types of spirits.
  Again, this will adversely affect the mage's reputation, though
  often not as badly as abusing minions. Many spirits believe
  preceptors should be able to take care of themselves. Those who
  aren't strong enough deserve what they get.
   </p>
   <p>
    For mages who don't wish to risk forcing the preceptor may
  bargain with them instead. Preceptors tend to be much brighter
  and self-aware than minions, so such dickering is possible.
  Typically mages attempt to deal with preceptors as equals, and
  arrive at mutually beneficial bargains. This often amounts to a
  trade of favors, the mage doing something for the spirit so the
  spirit will do something for the mage in return. Again, mages
  often prefer to develop a good working relationship with a few
  spirits.
   </p>
   <p>
    At the highest levels of power, coercing even the weakest
  Umbrood Lords can be quite a feat, even for a master mage. The
  rewards of such a binding are sufficient that many magi have
  risked their lives and sanity to attempt it. Umbrood Lords have
  senses unknown to ordinary men, however. Many of them know of
  attempts to bind them before they have even begun. Summoning them
  in such an instance is even more difficult than normal. Even if
  the mage successfully forces them to appear, they often bring
  servants along to help protect them. The ensuing battle is one
  the mage rarely survives.
   </p>
   <p>
    More than any other spirits, however, Umbrood Lords are
  interested in the physical worlds. Most of them are in the midst
  of elaborate schemes spanning the millennia of their immortal
  existence. Lords are often on the look-out for willing servants
  in the land of the living. Lords often offer patronage to willing
  mages, granting them power in the form of service. This is most
  definitely not a bargain between equals, and the mage would be
  wise to show deference to the lord.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is said in the ancient past there were powerful mages,
  perhaps the Shining Ones or Oracles, who could deal with Umbrood
  Lords as equals. The story continues that these mages bound each
  lord with a specific set of services, called a Greater Boon, that
  they must provide to any mage fulfilling the necessary
  requirements. The lords are forbidden to seek retribution against
  a mage using a Greater Boon as well. Mystics search diligently
  for the requirements of such Boons, and any discoveries they make
  are closely guarded secrets. It is said that some Umbrood Lords
  plant false information about Greater Boons to lure the unwary,
  and it is possible that many such Boons are in fact traps of this
  nature.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Spirit Pacts and Totems
   </h3>
   Some mages, rather than
  bargaining with a spirit anew each time it is summoned, try to
  reach a permanent agreement with a spirit for a regular exchange
  of services. Such an agreement is called a Pact, and various
  Traditions have wildly differing views on such bargains.
  Dreamspeakers have arrangement with various Naturae, who enter
  such pacts by becoming their Totem spirits. The Celestial Chorus
  often allies itself with various patron Saints or Angels. The
  Euthanatos sometimes enter such relationships with the spirits of
  the dead, though they have a less than perfect reputation in
  their realm. The Nephandi make their own dark deals with strange
  things from beyond.
   <p>
    Sometimes the pact is little more than a verbal or written
  agreement of services. However, a true Pact is a spiritual bond
  between the mage and the spirit. Spirits seems to draw sustenance
  from this arrangement, in the form of a point of Quintessence
  each day. There is almost always some act the mage must perform
  to provide the spirit with power, everything from daily prayers
  to the proverbial witch's teat from which demons receive blood.
  Spirits of the dead often ask the allies to seek out certain
  emotional states from which they can draw sustenance. Totem
  naturae are pleased if their Dreamspeaker ally "assumes the guise
  of the animal", by ritually acting as if they were a beast of the
  appropriate nature.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are generally two parts to a spirit Pact: the Boons and
  the Bans. Boons of a Pact are the benefits the spirit provides
  the mage. Indeed, the Boons of the Umbrood Lords are said to be
  the result of elaborate and ancient Pacts in the past. Boons can
  be special services the spirit will perform for the mage. Boons
  may also include special powers the spirit may grant the mage.
  These powers make include increases in the ratings of a mages
  Traits, or the ability to perform certain Rotes through the
  spirits power. The Werewolf books provide a plethora of good
  ideas for Boons.
   </p>
   <p>
    Bans are the things the spirit asks of a mage. They invariably
  include some sort of regular ritual to empower the spirit. They
  almost always include some sort of moral taboos as well, things
  the mage should or should not do, in keeping with the spirits
  moral attitudes. One almost universal ban is that the mage enter
  no Pacts with other spirits. Should a mage break one of the Bans,
  either by failing to do something he should or by doing something
  he shouldn't, the Pact is broken as well. The mage loses all the
  spirit's Boons, until he is able to reconcile himself with his
  spirit Ally.
   </p>
   <p>
    Generally, the more powerful the spirit a mage allies with,
  the greater the Boons the mage will receive. There are some
  limits to this, however. The more powerful spirits often have
  greater Bans as well. In addition, great spirits have many
  concerns, sometimes having several mortal allies, and can devote
  less attention to a mage. Thus, while the powers a mage gains may
  be greater, they are available less often. Many mages seek out
  weaker spirits to forge Pacts with, considering the loss of power
  worth the increase in reliability.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Communication with Spirits
   </h3>
   Since times immemorial, mages
  have sought to communicate with spirits to learn deep spiritual
  mysteries. Such mages are often frustrated in their attempts. A
  simple Spirit 1 effect allows a mage to speak to spirits, but
  comprehension does not necessarily follow. Spirits are well known
  for the perverseness when it comes to revealing information.
   <p>
    The simpler spirits are difficult to talk to because they are
  not very bright. It can take a great deal of time just to get the
  spirit to understand the mage's question, and even more time for
  it to formulate a sensible answer. The mage must often filter
  through the spirit alien perception of existence as well. Such
  weak spirits know little of consequence in any case.
   </p>
   <p>
    More powerful spirits are more understandable, but are more
  likely to have ulterior motives to any answer they give. Some
  spirits refuse to answer certain questions because they are
  "forbidden" by higher powers. Other spirits delight in lying for
  the simple joy in the confusion this brings. Infernal spirits are
  particularly nefarious liars, but even seemingly benevolent
  spirits are not above bending the truth, "for the mage's own
  good".
   </p>
   <p>
    Spirits seem to be particularly resistant to attempts to force
  information from them. Many having the knack of completely
  believing anything they say while they say it, so that they
  appear sincere to any truth-scrying spells. This is true even if
  they contradict themselves mere moments later. Mentally probing
  spirits is especially dangerous. The minds of spirits are often
  alien labyrinths from which a mage is lucky to return with her
  sanity intact, much less learn anything.
   </p>
   <p>
    Even the most well-meaning spirits tend to couch their answers
  in riddles and incomprehensible metaphors. This, more than
  anything else, accounts for the negative reputation of spirits in
  this area. There is some evidence that this style of answering is
  not out of malignancy, however. Spirits are creatures of emotion
  and metaphor. To them, a metaphorical answer expresses a more
  fundamental truth than a straight response would. To a spirit,
  the inherent meaning lies in the emotional and metaphysical
  context of the question. Spirits are simply confused when asked
  to answer directly, having already given the best answer they
  know how.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Spirit Forms
   </h3>
   One of the greatest mysteries of spirits is
  their form. Spirits come in a bewildering variety of shapes and
  sizes. Some of them appear in different forms at different times,
  and others change shape even as the mage watches. What does and
  does not govern the appearance of a spirit, and what, if
  anything, is the "true form" of a spirit, is a matter of much
  debate amongst mages. There are some mages who believe that the
  way a spirit is summoned influences the form it takes. Again,
  according to the Goetic mages:
   <blockquote>
    "Using the specific rituals described in the grimoires the mage
    can summon specific beings in a specific form to do specific
    tasks. This is in a way a charade, since the summoned being can
    in general appear in any form or be almost anything. However,
    by performing the ritual exactly as described, the mage and the
    beings bind each other in a kind of covenant, forcing each
    other to 'play by the rules'. The spirit will appear in its
    classic form and perform its traditional services.
    <p>
     "It is often necessary to modify the rituals to suit the
    modern times, since their classic forms are prone to paradox.
    Having a lion headed man appear out of the air riding on a bear
    followed by 30 minstrels is not a good idea. Many rituals can
    be reworked to become coincidental, so the spirit manifests as
    something more safe, like a black limo with a sharply dressed
    businessman or a bird landing outside the window. These types
    of changes are dangerous, since the mage risks making the
    spirit more unpredictable and free by straying from the
    traditional methods."
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   Mages who subscribe these beliefs often go on to say
  that the form a spirit takes is larger shaped by the summoning
  mages attitudes and expectation. This would go a long way to
  explaining why certain mages tend to encounter certain spirits
  more frequently than others. Many Celestial Chorus mages deal
  mostly with Angels and Demons, while Dreamspeakers encounter more
  nature spirits. Hermetic Mages tend to meet with more elementals,
  while Techno-mages meet more Technological spirits.
   <p>
    This seems true even for the greater Umbrood lords. It is said
  that the Lord of Dreams, when he appears, takes on a form
  appropriate to his viewers culture. To the Akashics he has a more
  Oriental appearance, to African Dreamspeakers he seems black, and
  so forth. It is even said he has different animal forms, such as
  that of a great black cat, when he deals with other living
  creatures as well.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are a few mages who go so far as to say that a summoning
  mage completely shapes a spirits being. According to this theory,
  spirits have no independent existence until summoned. The Rote of
  Summoning, rather than calling a spirit, in actuality creates the
  spirit out of whole cloth from the raw material of the Umbra. Any
  semblance of an independent existence is added by the mages
  expectations. While few mages are willing to go this far, it is
  becoming a popular theory amongst Techno-mages, particularly
  certain members of the Sons of Ether and the Technocracy.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Naturae
   </h3>
   One of the most common "races" of spirits, the
  Naturae, resemble normal animals and plants. They wander the
  Umbral landscapes, living as their counterparts in the physical
  world do, though they are less numerous. Minion naturae are often
  indistinguishable from living animals and plants, though they may
  have a few spirit powers appropriate to their natures. These weak
  spirits are no more intelligent than there natural equivalents.
   <p>
    Naturae preceptors usually have these special powers. They are
  intelligent, and have been known to ally themselves with
  Dreamspeakers and other mages as "totem spirits". There seems to
  be a single naturae lord for each species of animal or plant, but
  the concerns of these spirits are alien, and they care little for
  the ways of men. They include Fileet, Lady of Birds, Bast, Queen
  of Catkind and Hastashak, Lord of Lizards. Some ancient texts
  describe ways to placate and deal with various animal and plant
  lords.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Elementals
   </h3>
   Another sort of spirit mages commonly deal
  with are elementals. Elemental minions are simple manifestations
  of their elemental power, and are barely sentient by human
  standards. Elemental preceptors, or greater elementals, are more
  intelligent, albeit still alien, and can be bargained with.
  Again, there seems to be a single lord for each element who war
  on each other constantly in far off umbral realms. The weaker
  elements reside in Umbral regions near their physical
  counterparts, whose energies they feed on.
   <p>
    The four most common elementals are the traditional earth,
  air, fire and water, called respectively Gnomes, Sylphs,
  Salamanders and Undines. In addition to their obvious powers,
  earth is associated with the sphere of Matter, air with Mind,
  fire with Forces and water with Life. A mage must use a
  conjunctional effect, using level 1 of the appropriate sphere in
  addition to Spirit 2, to summon an elemental. The elementals
  lords are Paralda of Air, Djin of Fire, Niksa of Water and Ghob
  of Earth.
   </p>
   <p>
    In addition to the traditional four, there are a multitude of
  other elementals, such as spirits of storm, moonlight, rivers,
  glass, metal, plastic, electricity, radiation and other peculiar
  creatures. Some mages believe that the elemental lords of these
  less common spirits are arrayed in a feudal hierarchy under the
  four great elemental lords. Others believe a few are independent,
  or are in revolt against their masters. Most attempts to speak
  with elementals about their politics ends in confusion.
   </p>
   <p>
    At least one large segment of elementals seem to independent
  of the elemental lords: the spirits of nature. Moon spirits (or
  lunes), storm and mountain spirits seem to be subject to
  different rules and leaders than other elementals. The
  Dreamspeakers claim they are all ultimately servants of Gaia, and
  should be more properly grouped under Naturae.

    Spirits of Technology
   </h3>
   The advance of modern society has
  led to the proliferation of a large number of technological
  spirits. These spirits mostly dwell in cities, especially in
  areas with large amounts of technology. The motivations of these
  spirits are difficult to understand, but they seem to feed off
  such technological energies as electricity, money or information
  flow, and seek to actively spread technology, so as to provide
  additional sources of energy for the. The Techno-spirits are
  among the few that the Technocracy is willing to deal with, and
  Virtual Adepts are fond of them as well.
   <p>
    Techno-spirits usually appear in geometric, machine-like or
  insect- like forms. There actions seem to be very ordered and
  predictable, though not necessarily comprehensible.
  Techno-spirits might perform some repeated task (like travelling
  up and down a phone line) for its entire existence. One of the
  most difficult part of dealing with Techno-spirits is convincing
  it to break out of its routine. They are often involved in
  building some peculiar spiritual construct in the Umbra. They
  seem to hate disorder, and will swarm to repair any damage to the
  construction. They rarely directly attack the source of the
  damage, though repeated attacks on their work will eventually
  attract their attention.
   </p>
   <p>
    While techno-spirits seem to be very ordered, it is difficult
  to discern any sort of hierarchy among them. Weaker spirits defer
  to stronger ones, but don't seem to follow their orders, per se.
  At times it seem like a large group of techno-spirits are all
  working toward a common goal, but if there is any sort of
  direction, it is more in the nature of some sort of insectile
  hive-mind. Very often these creations seem to serve little
  purpose, so perhaps there is no direction beyond simple instinct.
  Of course, it is always possible there are powerful
  Techno-spirits directing the others in some mysterious fashion
  beyond the ken of ordinary men.
   </p>
   <p>
    Many mages believe that Techno-spirits are the servants or
  perhaps even the creations of the Technocracy. It is true the
  Technomancers utilize these spirits for their work in the Umbra,
  and Void Engineers in particular have expended a great deal of
  effort learning to control these creatures. They use them to
  reinforce Technocracy structure in the Umbra, and to patrol for
  violations of the Gauntlet by such forces as the Nephandi or
  Marauders. However, these spirits are sufficiently numerous that
  there are large number not under Technocracy control.

    [Author's Note: At this point, I more or less ran out of steam
  and got distracted by other projects. Here are a few more ideas
  for finishing out the spirit bestiary, but I leave that to you,
  I'm afraid.]
