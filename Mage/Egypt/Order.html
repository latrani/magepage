   The Egyptian Order of Hermes

  <h2>
   Alexandria
  </h2>
  <a href="Mage/Egypt/Alexandria.html">
   The
  Library of Alexandria
  </a>
  is one of the major strongholds of the
  Order, but unfortunately it cares little about the city and what
  goes on in it. It mainly relies on the information revealed by
  the Ahl-I- Batini, which makes it very dependent on them for all
  matters relating to the physical world.
  <p>
   There exists a small waystation, Osiris Hotel, an
  out-of-the-way hotel owned by a grumpy old couple which actually
  serves as a station for hermetics travelling to and from Egypt,
  or waiting for admission to the Library. West Delta Transport
  Company, a shipping company allied with the Order, can provide
  entry to the country with no questions asked, a very cursory
  check of the passport and no custom control of the luggage.

  <h2>
   Cairo
  </h2>
  The Order is weak in Cairo, despite a long and
  illustrious history. Currently there exist just a single chantry,
  the Luxor Club. But until the 70's, Cairo was dominated by the
  Sittah wa ashrin (lit "26", a reference to the cabalist truth
  that god is unity and love), a quite powerful hermetic-batini
  chantry south of the city dating back to the Fatimid era. In 1971
  the Technocracy suddenly attacked with overwhelming force,
  destroying it utterly and building the iron works of Helwan above
  it, harnessing the sanitised nodes and preventing all attempts to
  reach the remaining tunnels. This was a hard blow against the
  Traditions in Cairo, and completely disrupted the Order of Hermes
  and Batini in Cairo for a decade.

       <p>
        This chantry was founded during the British occupation by a
  group of colonialist hermetics, in direct opposition to the
  Sittah wa ashrin. At first the both chantries worked against each
  other, but slowly they became more cordial as they began to
  divide the occult territory between themselves. The Temple
  (usually called the Club) concentrated on Egyptology and the
  digs, trying to prevent the Technocracy from obliterating history
  and placing all important artefacts in museums to leach
  quintessence from them. The Sittah was more active in politics
  and trade, helping the Club to send away some artefacts and
  engaging in metaphysical battles for the future of Egypt.
       </p>
       <p>
        After the end of the occupation the Club has slowly dwindled;
  its archaic British style and strong ties again put it in
  conflict with the Arabic Sittah, and it found it harder to
  recruit new members. Most members arrived directly from outside
  Egypt, and it began to have trouble gaining Egyptian contacts.
  When the Sittah was destroyed the Club was dumbfounded, and while
  it tried to help the survivors, it didn't manage to use the
  situation in any constructive way. Most hermetic mages left Cairo
  for the Library of Alexandria, which was rapidly growing in
  importance at this period.
       </p>
       <p>
        Currently there are just three members - Ethan
  Barnes-Wentworth, Jonathan Cunningham and Dr. Victor D. Noble (of
  the Sons of Ether). The Club continues its limited egyptological
  research, but is clearly in decline. Dr. Noble spends most of his
  time in geographical expeditions to study the true flow of the
  Nile and to find its secret origin, while Barnes-Wentworth and
  Cunningham prefers to observe Egypt from their air-conditioned
  study rather than visit the digs or old temples.
       </p>
       <p>
        Still, the Club has its secrets. The mages know more about the
  pyramids than anybody in the Order of Hermes, and has amassed an
  impressive library of ancient Egyptian lore, probably second to
  none. They spend much time sifting through it, discovering
  patterns and old secrets; in fact, all three mages have begun to
  be affected by the peculiar force of ancient Egypt. Just as their
  patron Amun was the god of secrets, they have become keepers of
  secrets. They know a great deal, but do not reveal it even to
  themselves, just hinting behind their facade of colonialist
  gentlemen.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Club lies on al-Gazirah island, in the British quarter of
  the city. It lies on a quiet but respectable street, surrounded
  on both sides by equally staid and British buildings. The cover
  is perfect, nobody in the vicinity ever notices the club or the
  infrequent visits of guests. Inside the building the style is
  gracefully colonial, complete with a real English butler, a
  reading room where the mages usually greet their guests and guest
  rooms for the rare visitors.
       </p>
       <p>
        The chantry is fuelled by a powerful node on the other Cairo
  island, Al-Rawdah; according to the myth this was the place where
  Set and Horus had their final battle, and the divine blood flowed
  into the sandy island. Beneath the cellar of a house built in the
  50's the mages have dug a circular chamber with simple, dried red
  clay walls covered with sacred hieroglyphs. In the middle stands
  a double-cube altar: a white marble cube on top of a black, a
  symbol for the unity of opposites (with a hint of the eventual
  triumph of good over evil). The true power of the node is seldom
  unleashed, and instead stored for future use or defence.
