  <h1>
   The Egyptian Gods
  </h1>
  Each district of Egypt was home to at
  least one god or goddess, living in the shrine or temple. The
  fortunes of the regions and their deities were deeply
  interlinked; if a region was poor, so was its god. The
  relationships between the deities were determined by (or
  determined) the relationships between the districts. The
  unification of Egypt during the first dynasty also meant that the
  different gods were unified under a single ruling god.
  <p>
   The gods existed partially in this world through their
  statues, which were washed, dressed and brought food like living
  beings by the priests. At certain times of the year the god paid
  visits to each other's temples, carried on special boats along
  the Nile and giving their blessings to the land.

  <h2>
   The Nature of the Egyptian Gods
  </h2>
  From a hermetic point of
  view gods and other great forces can exist at several levels at
  once, just as the Egyptian soul existed on several planes. While
  a god exists as a pure emanation from the Ultimate in the realm
  of platonic forms, it will manifest on the lower planes in
  various ways that reflect its true nature. Thus Horus exist in
  the highest Umbra as the pure form of the divine warrior-king, he
  will manifest in the high and middle Umbra as the god Horus, and
  in the physical world through statues, animals, visions or in the
  remote past even directly.
  <p>
   These manifestations doesn't have to be consciously divine to
  be manifestations of the gods. A falcon seen as a sign from Horus
  or a dream revealing the wishes of Isis are completely natural
  phenomena, but work as coincidental explanations for the divine
  activities in the world. Even people may be manifestations of the
  gods; a great and righteous warrior manifests the virtues and
  power of Horus even if he doesn't know anything about Egyptian
  mythology and acts entirely of his own accord. Some individuals
  strive to manifest their gods more fully (like some Christians
  attempting Imitationi Christi), and by devoutness become more
  clear manifestations of their gods. This was the basis of much of
  Egyptian religious magick: by invoking the gods into themselves,
  the mages would temporarily manifest their powers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the same way there is no contradiction between seeing the
  gods as heroic representations of leaders and heroes of the past
  and true gods; the heroes reflected the god which they later
  became identified with, and by their physical existence they made
  the god known. There may once have been a great hero or mage
  known as Osiris that latter generations worshipped as a god. But
  that doesn't mean Osiris the god didn't exist before Osiris the
  man, who was his avatar (in the Hindu sense; compare this to the
  myths of the avatars of Vishnu). Osiris the man revealed the myth
  of Osiris the god.
  </p>
  <p>
   It should be noted that the Egyptian gods were not simply
  umbrood beings playing games with the humans, the interaction was
  much more subtle. According to some theories, spirits and other
  aetheric beings need the perceptions and beliefs of people to
  gain shape and power (compare this to Adam naming the animals -
  to name something is to give it existence). Thus the worship of
  the gods gave them form, individuality and the ability to
  manifest in the world. If this worship is broken or forgotten,
  the gods will retire to the high umbra and loose their
  individuality until it is restored.

   The Myth of Kingship
  </h2>
  <blockquote>
   The basic dogma of the ruler-cult proclaimed that the pharaoh
    was the earthly manifestation of the sky god Horus. So the myth
    of transmission of kingship from Osiris via the machinations of
    Isis to her son Horus is vital to understanding the status and
    power of the soverign in ancient Egypt.
   <cite>
    George Hart,
    Egyptian Myths
   </cite>
  </blockquote>
  The central myth of importance in this chronicle is
  the family feuds of Isis, Osiris, Set and Horus. A highly
  condensed version follows (see any book about Egyptian mythology
  for more details):
  <p>
   Osiris and Set were the sons of Nuit and Geb. As Ra retired
  Osiris ascended to the throne, becoming the ruling god. But Set
  wanted the power, and lured Osiris into a trap and killed him. He
  scattered his body into pieces, throwing them into the Nile and
  crowning himself as the new ruler. But Isis, Osiris widow,
  managed to gather the parts of Osiris' body with the help of her
  friends, and then revived it with the magick of Anubis (Set's
  son) and Nepthys (Set's wife and Isis sister); this was the
  origin of the mummification ritual. Although she could not
  restore Osiris to true life, he could ascend to the throne of the
  underworld, becoming the ruler of the dead. He also sired a son
  with his wife.
  </p>
  <p>
   When Set heard about it he was enraged and sent his warriors
  after the fleeing Isis. After many adventures and dangers she
  found sanctuary in the delta, where she gave birth to Horus. The
  god grew up in secret, protected and instructed by his mother.
  Finally he was old and strong enough to confront his uncle,
  claiming his right to the throne. The dispute turned into a great
  duel of which many stories have been written, but in the end Set
  was defeated and humiliated, and Horus ascended to the throne,
  becoming the new ruler of gods and men.

    Horus is the warrior-god of the Kingdom,
  representing just and upright leadership and things to come. He
  is usually depicted as a falcon or a falcon- headed human. He is
  the son of Isis and Osiris who avenged his father and reclaimed
  the crown from his uncle Set.
    <p>
     There are many versions of the god, worshipped at different
  places and times:
    </p>
    <div class="c1">
     Harsiesis (Horus son of Isis) Horus as the defenceless baby
    born of Isis and Osiris, hidden in the marshes of Buto from the
    attacks of Set (compare this to the myths about the holy family
    in Egypt in Christianity). He is the magickal child.
     <p>
      Harpokrates (The infant Horus) Horus as a child,
    representing the new born sun (and in thelemic magick as the
    god of silence, since he is depicted as holding his index
    finger to his lips). Depicted as a shaved child with a
    sidelock, with a royal crown and uraeus.
     </p>
     <p>
      Harendotes (Horus the avenger of his father) Horus as a
    grown man, who fights to reclaim the land and avenge his
    father.
     </p>
     <p>
      Har-pa-Neb-Taui (Horus Lord of the Two Lands) Horus as king
    of the lands.
     </p>
     <p>
      Haroeris (Horus the Elder) An early form of Horus. He was a
    god of light. His eyes represented the sun and the moon.
     </p>
     <p>
      Horus Behudety (Horus of Edfu). Horus as the midday sun.
    Originally worshipped in the western delta and eventually his
    cult spread to his great shrine in Edfu. Horus of Edfu fights a
    great battle against Set and his minions in the form of a
    winged sun disk or as a hawk headed lion.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ra-Harakhte (Horus of the two horizons) Horus identified
    with Ra and the daily voyage of the sun from horizon to
    horizon. The composite deity was represented as a falcon or a
    falcon-headed man wearing a solar disk and double crown.
     </p>
     <p>
      Harmakhet (Horus in the Horizon) Horus as the rising sun,
    associated with Khepri. Depicted as a man with a falcon's head
    or a sphinx (the sphinx has been widely worshipped as a
    manifestation of Harmakhet).
     </p>
    </div>
    It is interesting to notice the strong similarities to the
  archangel Michael in the religions of the Book, and the fact that
  Michael is said to be the protector of the Nile delta.
    <p>
     The Eye of Horus, known as the Udjat eye, is a very powerful
  symbol for divine power. It is said to represent the healthy eye
  of Horus (the other was wounded by Set, but magickally restored
  by Isis) identified with the sun. Since Horus and Re sometimes
  were amalgamated, it is sometimes called the Eye of Re (or the
  left eye is the eye of Re and the right the eye of Horus).

     Isis is the wife and sister of Osiris. She is
  usually depicted carrying a head-dress with a throne (her name
  means "Stone seat") or a moon and sun disk (a later addition).
  She is the goddess of nature, magick and power, the great mother
  who protects her family and brings up the king. Of the entire
  Egyptian pantheon she is the goddess who still is most active
  today, taking an interest in the events of the world and trying
  to further her own aims.

      Isis was well known as the most skilled magician of the gods,

      Set is the warrior-god of desert, eternally opposed
  to the god-king Horus of the Nile. He is the brother of Isis,
  Osiris and his wife Nepthys. He is usually depicted as having a
  head of a strange animal, somewhere between a donkey, a tapir and
  a giraffe. This animal, known as the Set beast, has never been
  identified but ancient texts refers to it as "rude" and violent;
  it may have gone extinct or now exist as bygones in the Umbra.
      <p>
       Set is not just the cartoon evil god some make him out to be;
  Set has his own reasons to be what he is. Once Set was the god of
  the Seti people in Lower Egypt, a red-haired people whose
  standard was the Set beast. The Seti were defeated by the Horu
  people, worshipers of Horus and the eventual creators of the
  first dynasty. Ever since, Set has been in opposition to Horus
  and the rulership he represents, sometimes overpowering his
  rival, sometimes defeated. His goal is to destroy all authority
  and spread the deserts and wastelands over the world, a revenge
  for all his defeats and humiliations. However, these motivations
  are not widely known, and most mages simply regard Set as the
  pure antithesis of the ordered divine warrior-king Horus: the god
  of foreign invasions, lack of control and disaster.

       Thoth is the god of wisdom, letters, the recording

  depicted as ibis-headed, often carrying a scribes pallet or a
  papyrus. He is said to be self- created before creation, the one
  who gave Ptah the Word that caused everything to come into being.
  He is also seen as a moon- god, possibly because he won the five
  sacred days of the year from the moon-god Khonshu in a game of
  draughts.

        Thoth is the most important deity to the Order of Hermes.
  Although the hermetic mages do not worship it (as some choristers

  and moral law, truth, justice, order and balance, depicted as a
  woman with a ostrich feather in her hair (the feather of truth).
  She represents the divine order of the universe, the order which
  can not and should not be broken. The Law of Maat is in some
  sense the paradigm, and mages or sleepers breaking it must face
  the consequences. In the past, the laws of the land had to
  conform to the Law of Maat, or disorder and chaos would result
  (as in the case of Akhenaten's heresy). It is interesting to
  compare this to the concept of sharia in Islam, where the laws
  must conform to the spirit of the acts of Mohammed.

           The jackal-god of mummification and the quests after

  decay and their souls from attacks in the underworld.

           Her name means "Lady of the house", refering to the
  part of the sky where Horus lived. The sister of Isis, wife of
  Set. She is a goddess of the memory of the dead, and some mages
  regard her as the "goddess of that which isn't eternal" (there is
  a small sect of Euthanatos who regard her as the goddess of the
  Good Death).

            Nephtys appears to be linked to Isis, both as her opposite and

            From the southern sky, the ancients had chosen thirty-six stars
    or constellations, the decans, whose consecutive helical
    risings occurred approximately every ten days. The rising of
    each decan occurred after it had passed seventy days of
    invisibility, a period corresponding to that of mummification.
    Among these stars are Osiris (Orion) and Isis-Sothis (Sirius),
    symbols of yearly renewal, of the regeneration of the Nile, of
    cyclic death and rebirth.

           The star Sirius/Sothis played an important role in
  the cult as timekeeper. The annual swelling of the Nile begins
  during the hottest time of the year, at the same time as Sirius
  rises at the same time as the sun (today July 23). This formed
  the basis of the Egyptian calendar, and the year begun with the
  rise of Sothis. The calendar had twelve 30-day lunar months plus
  five extra epagomenal days sacred to the gods Osiris, Horus, Set,
  Isis and Nephtys. However, the calendar slowly shifted with a
  period of 1460 years, a period called a sothic cycle.
           <p>
            Sothis was a seen as a manifestation of Isis linked with
  renewal, growth and timekeeping. Isis was often depicted as a
  woman bringing water with a star, a symbol still found in the
  seventeenth arcanum of the tarot, the Star.
           </p>
           <p>
            During classical times Sirius was described as red in colour,
  but today it is white. This symbolises the eventual move of the
  statue of the goddess to upper Egypt (whose colour is white
  rather than the red of lower Egypt).
