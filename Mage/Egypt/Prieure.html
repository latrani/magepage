    to capture Malta and the treasure held by the Knights of
    Malta."

   The Prieure de Sion is known as one of the most
  secretive hermetic orders, profoundly involved in political and
  esoteric conspiracies and generally mistrustful of the rest of
  the Order. It is suspected among occultists that it is the
  hermetic side of the Merovingeans of the Celestial Chorus: a
  tradition-spanning secret society. Still, many students of
  conspiracies wonder why it is so obvious that the Prieure is
  conspiring? What is
   <i>
    really
   </i>
   going on?
   <p>
    Actually, many of the rumours are true. The Prieure de Sion
  was founded to protect and aid the sangreal, the Holy Blood. The
  Holy Blood consists of certain bloodlines inheriting mystical
  power, a form of spiritual nobility. According to some stories
  they are the descendants of Jesus, whose child with Mary
  Magdalene was smuggled to southern France and in time founded the
  Merovingean lineage of kings. Whether this is true or not is hard
  to tell, especially since the Prieure actively seeks to confuse
  the issue, but. it seems that the sangreal is linked with the
  descendants of several major characters in history (Osiris,
  Caesar, King Arthur, Muhammed, Napoleon etc.). The Prieure sees
  the Holy Blood as more than a predisposition towards magickal,
  spiritual or mundane power, but as true spiritual nobility
  destined to rule. As the land and king are one, by placing one of
  the Blood on the throne the land can be perfected. Their vision
  is to bring members of certain bloodlines to the metaphysical
  thrones of Europe, creating a new era.
   </p>
   <p>
    Exactly when they were founded is unknown except for the
  highest levels. Most members suspect the order can be traced back
  to the middle ages, but there are rumours that it began in Egypt,
  as a sacred order of priests protecting the Horus child from the
  followers of Set. Another story link them to the Ishmailites, who
  sought to bring the descendants of Ali to power in the Kaliphate.
  A third theory is that the order has emerged several times,
  rediscovering ancient wisdom.
   </p>
   <p>
    Their headquarters were originally in southern France, but
  during the crusades they moved to Malta, especially after
  breaking up with the Templars in 1188. Here they continued their
  plans, attempting to manipulate European politics to bring the
  Holy Blood to the thrones. At one point they made a fatal
  mistake: one of their initiates, Napoleon Bonaparte, joined
  forces with the Technocracy and in 1798 he attempted to take over
  the Prieure. The leaders managed to flee in secret with the most
  important genealogies, but Napoleon successfully siezed its
  resources and many members were hunted down and either killed or
  forced into the Technocracy. The Prieure hid in southern France
  again, slowly building a new and even more secret network across
  Europe and America.
   </p>
   <p>
    Recently, the leaders of the Prieure have decided it was time
  to hide their plans in the open: by leaking enough, they have
  made conspiracy theorists aware of their existence and some of
  their manipulations. The result is of course an impenetrable mist
  of speculation, best-seller books, misinformation and imitation
  that hides the real plans. While everybody are scrambling to
  search for secret tunnels in Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau, track down
  forged documents or to find out if Sir Isaac Newton really was a
  member, the Prieure is quietly working on its own goals in
  obscurity.
   </p>
   <p>
    Their current main plan is to bring up a number of candidates,
  and during the next chaotic decades attempt to put as many of
  them into positions of power. Many will fail, but the Prieure
  believes haste is necessary: a time of reckoning is approaching,
  and destiny itself will ensure that the right one will reach his
  throne. As this happens, the networks nurtured by the Prieure
  will link together, giving the new rulers the power needed to
  implement the will of the sacred.
