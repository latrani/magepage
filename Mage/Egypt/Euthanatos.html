   In Cairo there is a small group of Euthanatos present, living
  in the City of the Dead among the mausoleums and their many
  inhabitants. Unlike the other mages they concern themselves
  almost completely with the lives of the Sleepers, especially
  those who live among the graves.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Guardians protect the cities of the dead and their
  inhabitants, living, dead and otherwise. On one hand they protect
  the people from attacks from criminals, the Technocracy and the
  dark forces that dwell in the city (especially the Dogs of
  Shaitan). On the other hand, they comfort the dead and help them
  move on into the afterlives. They also keep an eye on the events
  in the Cairo Umbra.
  </p>
  <p>
   The other mages know of them, and usually leave them alone.
  The batini sometimes trade services for information, and some of
  the Choristers give them alms, but that is all. The Priestesses
  of Isis keeps a wary eye on the Euthanatos, who respond by
  keeping an eye on the sorceresses. Both work against the Dogs of
  Shaitan, but never coordinate their attacks, which are
  incompatible anyway.
  </p>
  <p>
   They inhabit a small mausoleum, half hidden behind a large
  pile of wreckage and at the side of a deep hole in the ground.
  Inside Grandfather and Son can usually be found
  </p>
  <p>
   <a name="grandfather">
   </a>
   Grandfather is the master of the
  Guardians, a powerful mage hidden in an unassuming body. He is
  bald, sinewy and quick, with no teeth and blurred eyes; he gives
  an eerie impression of being half dead, half alive. How old he is
  is anybody's guess, but his skills in separating life from death,
  truth from lies and power from weakness are fearsome.
  </p>
  <p>
   <a name="father">
   </a>
   Father is sometimes called "Father of
  the cats" when out of earshot. He speaks with the cats of Cairo,
  learning many things from their stories and prayers. He can often
  be seen walking through the city, surrounded by small cats that
  seem to regard him as their leader. When he sits down, a alleycat
  will almost always accompany him. Anybody who hurts the cats
  deliberately (and not just because they are a nuisance) will get
  his subtle revenge.
  </p>
  <p>
   <a name="son">
   </a>
   The Son is just an apprentice, and still
  far from a true Euthanatos. Most of the time he can be found
  lying on the floor of the mausoleum, hidden beneath a ill
  smelling piece of cloth apparently dead or asleep.
