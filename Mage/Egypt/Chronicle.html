   The Chronicle
  </h1>
  The chronicle consists of three parts, but
  also a number of more or less independent sub-plots. These
  sub-plots can be combined in a variety of ways, as the
  Storyteller decides. If needed, subplots can be ignored or added.
  <p>
   <a href="Mage/Egypt/Chronicle.html#part%20i">
    Part I: Osiris / Salt
   </a>
   . Preludes, bringing together the cabal,
  travelling to Egypt and encountering the land. This part deals
  with setting up the background for the rest of the chronicle,
  letting the PCs learn about their situation, gain some allies and
  enemies, and unlock some minor mysteries. This part is mainly
  social. It ends when the Armorers have gained enough information
  to decide that they really can build the two pyramids and set to
  work.
  </p>
  <p>
   <a href="Mage/Egypt/Chronicle.html#part%20ii">
    Part II: Isis / Sulphur
   </a>
   . Preparing the project to finish the
  plan, researching the necessary magick, gaining needed allies and
  avoiding enemies and other groups. In this part the PCs will
  delve deep into the history of Egypt, trying to gain the
  necessary knowledge. This part is mainly intellectual and
  magickal. It ends when the Armorers begin the real project of
  building the pyramids.
  </p>
  <p>
   <a href="Mage/Egypt/Chronicle.html#part%20iii">
    Part III: Horus / Mercury
   </a>
   . The completion of the project,
  removing hinders, keeping control over the situation and finally
  performing the great ritual to consecrate the pyramids. In this
  part the mages move from research and preparation to action. At
  the climax huge forces are unleashed, and if the foundations
  erected in the previous two parts are strong enough, then they
  can be balanced. Otherwise disaster will occur.
   <a name="main subplots">
   </a>
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Main Subplots
  </h2>
  <b>
   Mundane activities
  </b>
  : from the
  first day in Egypt, the PCs must deal with the mundane
  requirements: finding a place to live, avoiding attracting
  suspicion, gaining helpers and allies, obtaining permits and
  travelling around the land. This is not as simple as it sounds
  and can interfere with the other plans.
  <p>
   <b>
    The research
   </b>
   : the first problem is to find out whether
  the theories are right and the Pattern exists, if it can be
  completed and what forces are required to do it. This may involve
  plenty of both academic research, mundane and magickal
  archaeology and the need to contact and deal with some of the
  Awakened of Cairo.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Planning the Pattern
   </b>
   : once the research conclusively
  show how it could be done, the real work begins. The first, and
  most important step is to plan how to implement the Pattern. How
  will the Pattern be built? It will be a huge project, requiring
  significant resources, the involvement of many sleeper agencies
  and a significant risk of discovery. How to finance, hide and
  consecrate the pattern?
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Building of the Pattern
   </b>
   : even if the plan is faultless
  there will be countless contingencies, ranging from accidents and
  builder strikes to occult blackmail. During the building of the
  pattern the PCs have to protect the project, and if necessary
  fend of attacks from the forces of Set.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    The cleansing of the Pattern
   </b>
   : during the millennia
  since the Pattern was abandoned it has decayed, and Set has done
  his best to desecrate it. The taint must be removed as far as
  possible, and this can be both troublesome and dangerous.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    The completion of the Pattern
   </b>
   : Finally, the grand
  consecration has to be performed. The rite will tax even the
  powers of the Masters, and if disrupted the consequences will be
  devastating. How to hide that a new era is being ushered in? Can
  the forces invoked be bound into an ordered pattern, or will
  chaos be unleashed?

   <h3>
    Preludes and preparation
   </h3>
   Character preludes, ending in
  descriptions of their initiation into the armorers. At this point
  some of them knows very little about the real plan, except that
  the Masters have suggested that they have a long and dangerous
  (but possibly rewarding) journey ahead.
   <a name="the meeting">
   </a>
   <h3>
    The meeting
   </h3>
   The Masters summon the characters to a
  meeting at St. Vincent Manor outside Cambridge, to explain the
  true purpose of the Armorers and delineate the plan. This is a
  good time for the characters to start to get to know each other
  and the major NPCs.
   <p>
    The meeting is held in a comfortable if dark room on the
  second floor, with oak panelled walls with portraits of famous
  British mages, a fireplace flanked by two Egyptian statues (Isis
  and Osiris) and an antique table with inlaid Tree of Life with
  the sephiroth in different kinds of wood. When everyone has
  arrived, a butler closes the doors and Master Cavendish starts to
  explain. He unrolls a map of Lower Egypt with the Pattern
  superimposed.
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    "This, brothers and sisters, is the secret seal of our order.
    It is the pattern which the Egyptian priests prepared to
    perform the greatest invocation ever attempted. If finished, it
    would have allowed the great god Horus to manifest his
    influence in the physical world and once and ensured a kingdom
    forever ruled by justice and wisdom.
    <p>
     But as you can see, it was never finished. The two pyramids
    corresponding to Betelgeuse and Rigel were never built. The
    Pattern remains uncompleted to this day, most likely due to the
    machinations of Set, the great enemy. Leadership has become a
    matter of power and force rather than righteousness, wisdom and
    truth, and Egypt have succumbed to conquerors and
    corruption.
    </p>
    <p>
     But we can change that. The Pattern can be completed and
    consecrated, we have the secret knowledge of where the last two
    pyramids should
     <i>
      exactly
     </i>
     lie, and together we have
    skills, resources, allies and knowledge enough to bring the
    ancient plan to completion. Egypt will again become the centre
    of the world, and a new aeon will dawn."
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   After the speech Master Cavendish will gladly answer
  questions, discuss the feasibility of the plan (his opinion is
  that it is possible; hard but possible - the armorers were formed
  just for this purpose) and the practical matters of going to
  Egypt. Master Weith will keep silent, although he will answer
  questions posed to him.
   <p>
    The journey to Egypt will not be straight, Master Cavendish
  explains. The order will travel to Venice independently along
  several routes (a precaution to avoid surveillance of airports
  and to confuse potential enemies about their real destination).
  In Venice they will board the ship Letopolis of the West Delta
  Transport Company to go to Alexandria. On the way, they will
  briefly visit a cave on the Ionian islands where Cavendish
  explains they will seek guidance (he will be somewhat secretive
  about this). In Alexandria they will pay a visit to the Library,
  mainly to obfuscate their real purpose to other mages, and
  finally arrive in Cairo.
   </p>
   <h3>
    To Venice
   </h3>
   This section is just transport, and another
  chance to get characters to interact. There are no obvious
  pursuers, and beside the usual travel problems nothing happens.
  It might be interesting to see how elaborate precautions the
  characters take to hide their traces; if necessary remind them
  that the Technocracy might be watching through the surveillance
  cameras on train stations and in airport lounges.
   <h3>
    The Adriatic
   </h3>
   The Letopolis is a fairly small boat, crewed
  by captain Costos Dimon and his five crewmates. It doesn't look
  much for the world, but is a very well kept ship and a real
  advantage for mages moving around in the Mediterranean who want
  no questions asked. Costos is used to weird passengers, and as
  long as they do not endanger his boat he and his men doesn't care
  what they do.
   <p>
    During the journey from Venice Master Cavendish will explain
  the nature of the counsel they will seek: there is a natural cave
  on one of the Ionian islands, called the Ear of Odysseus. It is
  said to bring a prophetic dream to visitors who sleep in it. He
  suggests that it would be suitable for the characters to visit it
  before the last leg of the journey. The Masters will remain in
  the boat; if pressed they will admit that they have already slept
  in the cave and had their dreams.
   </p>
   <p>
    The island is small and rocky, largely uninhabited. The
  Letopolis anchors in the afternoon, and the Masters give the
  characters a simple map of the way up to the cave. The first part
  is just a winding trek up to the slope of the cliffs through
  fallen rocks and thorny bushes, but later it becomes almost a
  climb along a nearly invisible path on the face of the sandstone
  cliff. Eventually they will reach the cave. It overlooks the
  western ocean, where the sun is setting. Its floor, walls and
  ceiling has been carved out by air and water into smooth
  undulations, but now it is dry and surprisingly warm.
    <a name="the dream">
    </a>
   </p>
   <h3>
    The Dream
   </h3>
   The characters will have a vivid dream of the
  events that led to the reign of king Thutmosis IV; this serves
  both as an introduction to Egyptian history and myths, and as a
  prophecy of the future. If the storyteller plans to introduce new
  themes or plots into the story, they can be revealed in symbolic
  form as the dream unfolds.
   <p>
    As the dream begins, the characters are prince Thutmosis and
  his court on a hunting trip in the Valley of Gazelles. Each
  character has an alter ego:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Philippe is prince Thuthmosis. His two elder brothers are
    closer to the throne than him, but he wishes to become king and
    the time is coming closer when his father will decide who will
    become co-ruler and eventual king.
    </li>
    <li>
     Brian is a priest of Thoth, wise, inscrutable and skilled
    in magick.
    </li>
    <li>
     Rebecca is a scribe and advisor to Thuthmosis.
    </li>
    <li>
     Trond is a local priest of the decaying temples of Gizeh,
    an old man awed by the presence of the mighty prince and acting
    as a local guide.
    </li>
    <li>
     Jean is a general of the Egyptian army, a veteran who
    accompanies the young prince on his hunting.
    </li>
    <li>
     Francis is a priest of Amon the Unrevealed, mysterious and
    influential.
    </li>
    <li>
     Constantine is a powerful noble from Thebes, the son of the
    priest of Amon.
    </li>
    <li>
     Alicia is the lovely and loving concubine of Thuthmosis,
    but also a secret initiate of the priesthood of Isis.
    </li>
   </ul>
   The dreams begins with the hunt. The party hunts the
  gazelles in the valley beneath the pyramids and the half buried
  sphinx. The local priest or the priest of Thoth can tell stories
  about their builders, now lost in ancient history. While the
  others prepare the meal of the evening, Thuthmosis rests beneath
  the sphinx and has a dream (yes, a dream in a dream). In the
  dream the sphinx says to him that if he can free it from the sand
  covering it, he will become the next king.
   <p>
    Freeing the sphinx can be done in many ways. Brute force will
  work, but cleverness is better. There are too few servants in the
  party, but it might be possible to commandeer some of the
  villagers from a nearby village. The clever priests may come up
  with the idea to re-direct a small stream nearby so that it
  washes away the sand (this would explain some of the erosion
  found on the sphinx in modern times). Magick can also be used,
  but of course only magick of the classic Egyptian kind.
   </p>
   <p>
    After freeing the sphinx the hunting party returns to Thebes
  and the royal court. Here they meet the aged king Amenhotep II
  and Thuthmosis two brothers, both boasting about their military
  victories. Play up the royal splendour and court intrigues.
   </p>
   <p>
    How the brothers are disposed of depends on how active the
  characters are; if they just lean back and wait nothing seems to
  happen. However, if they start to plot then things start to
  happen. Use suitably ambiguous coincidences and omens to make it
  unclear how much is the work of the characters and how much is
  the work of the gods. Direct attacks are of course impossible
  since there are always people around the brothers, but accidents
  do happen. One of the brothers may suggest a hunting trip for
  lions in the eastern mountains. During the hunt the brothers
  might fall prey to a pride of unusually large lions. An even more
  elegant approach would be to turn the brothers against each
  other, so that they arrange their own assassinations.
   </p>
   <p>
    The dream can be interpreted as follows: uncovering the sphinx
  represents completing the Pattern (the sphinx has sometimes been
  worshipped as Harmakhet, Horus in the Horizon). It can be
  accomplished in many ways, but cleverness works better than
  strength. The whole meaning seems to be a kind of promise:
  restore Egypt, and Egypt will bring you to greatness.
   </p>
   <p>
    What is less clear is the meaning of the brothers. They
  actually represents the warring traditions and conventions of
  Egypt, who must eventually be defeated in order to bring
  completion to the new order. This defeat helped by the divine
  forces, likely lie beyond the end of this chronicle though.

   </p>
   <h3>
    Alexandria
   </h3>
   After a few days of peaceful travel across the
  Mediterranean Alexandria is sighted. The city isn't as impressive
  as most people expect given its history, but mages still can feel
  the residual presence of magick in this place. Just as the
  Letopolis anchors in the harbour, the customs inspector arrives,
  together with some armed aides. This might be a good time to make
  the characters a bit nervous and sweaty, but there is no reason
  to worry: he is safely bought by the West Delta Transport Company
  and will only make a cursory check of passports and the boat, and
  unless they have a literal corpse in the cargo he will nod and
  sign the necessary papers, doing a fairly convincing charade of
  the strict customs inspector.
   <p>
    As soon as the mages set their foot in Egypt they will feel
  something. To most it is just the feeling of getting back on dry
  land after several days on the sea, coupled with some
  anticipation of the adventures ahead. But Trond is hit hard: he
  feels as if something suddenly rears its head and looks his way,
  a huge force suddenly noticing their presence.
   </p>
   <p>
    Once in Alexandria, it is time to find a hotel and to get in
  touch with the
    <a href="Mage/Egypt/Alexandria.html">
     Library
    </a>
    . Master Cavendish has the address to Osiris Hotel,
  but getting there might turn out to be more complicated than
  expected: it is a new city with a foreign culture (even if
  Alexandria has significant European influences compared to
  Cairo), the luggage is heavy, the presence of two Masters might
  make it hard to move around inconspicuously and the address is
  slightly wrong. This is a great time to test their cultural
  adaptability.
   </p>
   <p>
    Once at Osiris Hotel (not the most comfortable hotel in the
  city, but the only one where your arrival is reported to the
  Library of Alexandria) they will get some rest for a few days
  while the question of their admittance is brought before the
  councillor of diplomacy. This is a good time to explore the city,
  visit sights such as Fort Quayt-Bay where the lighthouse of
  Pharos once stood (the resonance can still be felt in the
  stones), the mosque of Abu l- Abbas al-Mursi (Rebecca will
  immediately notice that the octagonal plan, three-tiered minaret
  and granite columns are definitely a case of modern sacred
  architecture are proof that as late as 1943 when it was rebuilt
  there were sacred architects around who knew how to channel
  quintessence), the Anfushi Tombs (with frescoes depicting Horus,
  Osiris, Isis and Anubis), the ruins of the Serapheum around
  Pompey's Pillar and the various museums; hermetic tourism.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Masters will visit the ruins of Canopus, today just masses
  of rubble marking the once powerful city. Here they will
  privately perform some kind of ceremony that might remind the
  knowledgeable onlooker of a hermetic laying down of wreaths; they
  will keep silent of what it is and what is so special about the
  place, but might mutter that in 1915 another war occurred
  here.
   </p>
   <p>
    Finally, just as the armorers are getting restless a messenger
  will arrive from the Library. He will bring them to a fairly
  modern shopping centre, filled with tourists and western goods.
  He ushers them into a passenger elevator and presses the buttons
  in a complicated numerological pattern based on the astrological
  conjunctions of that day. The elevator descends beneath the
  basements into an underground labyrinth of concrete, brick and
  masonry tunnels, suddenly opening up into the Library. There they
  will be greeted by the councillor of diplomacy and the High
  Librarian, who will greet the Masters cordially and invite them
  (not the characters) to his personal chambers. The councillor of
  diplomacy, Doctor Fuad Fawzi, will show them around and answer
  questions. Most likely several of the characters will feel like
  kids in a candystore - everywhere they turn there are treasures
  of magick and knowledge. At the same time it is important that
  they guard their tongues, since Fuad will discreetly try to get
  them to reveal their plans and goals (and he is not stupid - he
  will take note of what books they look at, and draw his own
  conclusions from their magickal abilities). The Masters will
  meanwhile discuss the whereabouts of the Book of Thoth, the state
  of Egypt and other small talk with the High Librarian. They are
  doing their best to misdirect him from their true purpose, a
  quite tricky objective.
   </p>
   <p>
    The visit will likely be relatively brief; the Masters are
  eager to get to Cairo and even if the Library is safer and almost
  irresistible for hermetics hungry for learning, it is a place
  where prying eyes and secret agendas are far too common. It may
  be possible to get in touch with the Library later, as Master
  Cavendish consoles them.
    <a name="arrival in cairo">
    </a>
   </p>
   <h3>
    Cairo
   </h3>
   Finally, after a short airline journey they arrive
  at Heliopolis Airport in Cairo. During the landing they will see
  the pyramids from the air. They are impressive even in the
  distance, and to mages they are doubly impressive - they appear
  to shimmer with magickal power. The city below spreads out in a
  haze of smog and dust, a mixture of labyrinthine streets and
  high-rise buildings whose overall colour is a slightly dirty
  brown.
   <p>
    The airport is harrowing; tourists and locals mill about each
  other, with a liberal sprinkling of stressed officials, heavily
  armed security guards, local guides, sellers and cab drivers
  looking for customers and the occasional thief and con-man.
  Getting to McPatric's place will turn out to be even more of a
  challenge - the highways are choked with noisy, polluting cars
  and the heat unbearable for most characters (making the car's air
  conditioning work is coincidental Forces magick, almost bordering
  on the vulgar). And since he lives near the Khan al-Khalili
  bazaar they will have to navigate labyrinthine passages often
  filled with people, animals, other vehicles and unexpected
  hinders such as the commotion around an impressive quarrel
  between two merchants. Give the players a feeling of the sheer
  vitality of Egypt, and how different it is from the cold,
  well-ordered streets of Europe or America.
   </p>
   <p>
    Once at McPatric's apartment, they can relax and began to plan
  their stay more in detail. High on the list is a house to live in
  (since they will likely want to set up a sanctum to work it
  should be safe from prying eyes and easily hidden); this is
  likely a job for McPatric and his contacts. Other things that
  should be undertaken as soon as possible is a visit to the
    <a href="Mage/Egypt/Order.html#luxor%20club">
     Luxor Club
    </a>
    and the
    <a href="Mage/Egypt/TempleOfSothis.html">
     Temple of Sothis
    </a>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    This is where the chronicle really starts; from now the
  actions of the characters will largely be the driving force.
  Introduce some of McPatric's contacts, give hints of the presence
  of other groups and generally let the Armorers begin their
  research on the Pattern. The goal of the Masters (who will keep
  in the background as they realise they are far too obvious and
  heavy artillery) is to set up a safe base of operations and to
  find out if their theories of the Pattern are true and the
  necessary information to decide if they should attempt to
  complete it.
   </p>
   <h3>
    The Pyramids
   </h3>
   Visiting the Pyramids is easy; getting to
  study them undisturbed is hard. At Gizeh there are tourists,
  guides, vendors and heavily armed security guards everywhere, and
  access is limited to the digs and funerary temples. Saqqarah is
  better, but still too crowded. Abu Ruwash is closed to the
  public, but Griffin may be able to get access. Just a general
  magickal perception will show that despite a long time and many
  attempts at desecration the pyramids are still quite powerful.
   <h3>
    Cairo
   </h3>
   Exploring Cairo can be rewarding. What is
  especially important to find out is if there are any sacred
  architects left around; the mosques, Garden City and the Tomb of
  Sa'd Zaghlul give a silent but affirmative answer. Once these
  have been discovered, the characters can begin to trace their
  architects and try to find out who inherited their secrets.
   <h3>
    The Luxor Club
   </h3>
   McPatric can introduce the chracters to
  the
   <a href="Mage/Egypt/Order.html#luxor%20club">
    Luxor Club
   </a>
   . Most likely the meeting will be a polite affair,
  where very little obvious is said but both sides gently probe
  each other for information. Barnes- Wentworth might give some
  important hints by allowing some drawings of pyramid measures lie
  around, and perhaps even allude to ratios.
   <a name="visiting sothis">
   </a>
   <h3>
    The Temple of Sothis
   </h3>
   Getting access to the dig requires
  some dealing with the Egyptian archaeological bureaucracy, but
  Brian Griffin ought to be able to deal with that. Professor
  Ritter and Brian know each other but do not get along well, which
  can be used to get a showing of the dig. Most likely Ritter will
  do his best to show his colleague how significant his own finds
  are, unlike those small digs Brian has been in. This could easily
  turn into an academic boasting contest, giving the other
  characters time to look at the dig more undisturbed.
   <p>
    Of course, it might be more useful to get down to the dig in
  the night when no sleepers are around. That requires the
  characters to get into the subway tunnels somehow and to avoid
  possible guards.
   </p>
   <p>
    The visit will tell them that the Pattern was indeed a real
  project during the fourth dynasty, and that something may have
  happened during the fifth to end it. Most importantly, the
  starmap reveals the secret angles. It might also make them
  interested in
    <a href="Mage/Egypt/OtherPlots.html#restoration%20of%20sothis">
     tracing down the figurine of Sothis
    </a>
    .
   </p>
   <h3>
    Research
   </h3>
   In addition, research at the Egyptian Museum,
  Institute d'Egypte, Egyptian Geographic Society, Cairo University
  and the Centre of Documentation Studies on Ancient Egypt is
  advisable to learn more of the Pattern.
   <p>
    While there is practically nothing in the old texts referring
  to the Pattern itself, there are plenty of inscriptions that
  allude to magick relating to it. This may become very useful to
  reconstruct the old rituals, or to decipher the inscriptions in
  the Temple of Sothis.
   </p>
   <h3>
    The Places
   </h3>
   Once the angles are known, the exact positions
  of Betelgeuse and Rigel can be found.
   <p>
    It turns out that Rigel is located in the desert some
  kilometres to the north-west of the pyramids at Gizeh, just south
  of road 11 to Alexandria. The desert is completely empty, except
  for a small, unassuming knoll. The land is owned by the state,
  and likely not very expensive to buy.
   </p>
   <p>
    Betelgeuse is to be built near the Nile, close to the small
  town Turah (where the limestone quarries of the Pyramids lie;
  possibly the intention was to have easy access to stone for the
  last and most powerful pyramid). The land is owned by several
  local homeowners and a small shoe factory, which means buying it
  could require some delicate diplomacy.
   </p>
   <h3>
    The Decision
   </h3>
   Once the Armorers have learned what they
  can, the Masters call for a meeting. If it turns out that they
  know the angles, the positions of the new pyramids, whether there
  are sacred architects still around and if they believe they have
  the magickal skills needed to perform the project, Master
  Cavendish proposes that the order should start planning to fulfil
  the Pattern.

    </h2>
    <p>
     During this part the Armorers get in touch more deeply with
  the mages of Cairo, the complications of their project and the
  brewing
     <a href="Mage/Egypt/Jihad.html">
      Ascension Jihad
     </a>
     . Their goal is to find the last pieces of
  information needed to complete the pattern, secure the resources
  they need and begin the work.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Finding the Architects
    </h3>
    To build the pyramids the Armorers
  need to find the sacred architects. Getting normal architects is
  trivial; what is really needed is architects privy to the secrets
  of pyramid building. It appears clear that this knowledge is
  still present in Egypt somewhere (a hermetic axiom is that
  knowledge never vanishes, it is just hidden).
    <p>
     The most obvious way of finding them is to look for sacred
  architecture, and then trace down its builders. Unfortunately
  there is no such architecture from the modern era, just
  soul-crushing high-rise apartments, badly repaired ottoman houses
  or the occasional piece of bombastic socialist architecture. The
  last real sacred architecture date back to the 30's, and should
  provide the starting point for research.
    </p>
    <p>
     <a href="Mage/Egypt/Batini.html#architects">
      The Architects
     </a>
     have hidden well; it is not obvious who they
  are. Research in archives, the record of the Egyptian Architect's
  Association and history books will likely reveal a number of
  possible candidates (and likely alert the Architects to that
  somebody is trying to trace them down). If the characters start
  looking for the candidates they might notice the house of Qansuh
  Shaqra, which is a subtle hint to those who understand
  architecture. If they are getting too close, the Architects might
  try to send somebody to investigate or attempt to confuse the
  characters.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once contact has been made, the next problem is to make a deal
  with the Architects. This is not that hard, since they would be
  delighted that their services are yet again needed, but since
  neither side fully trusts the other there will likely be much
  dealing, subterfuge and hidden information involved.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Money and Power
    </h3>
    In order to build the two pyramids money
  and influence are needed. At the same time discretion is needed
  to keep the plan secret.
    <p>
     Archimedes Cavendish has influential connections in Britain,
  and the whole family has access to a sizeable fortune. Still,
  getting funding for the project likely involves persuading some
  major banks to invest, which means a good cover has to be
  developed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Covering up the pyramid building requires some creativity. The
  pyramids do not need to look like pyramids to act like one, and
  they must not arouse any suspicion among the sleepers or mages in
  Egypt. One possibility is to make the Turah pyramid a tourist
  hotel; as long as it gets built it serves its purpose. The desert
  pyramid is harder, it will be built in the middle of nowhere.
    </p>
    <p>
     Getting the necessary permits, buying the land and greasing
  plenty of hands is the next step. This is where the real work
  starts; most likely both Archimedes, Francis and Philippe will
  need to work together to gain allies and contacts, convince the
  right people and find consultants who can deal with the Egyptian
  bureaucracy.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is not inconceivable that other groups could be helpful
  here. The Luxor Club has some influential connections, as does
  the
     <a href="Mage/Egypt/Batini.html#brethren">
      Brethren
     </a>
     , but involving them might give them too much
  information about the Plan. Both Masters have extensive contacts
  among hermetic masters across the globe, and can provide some
  long-range help, but this also comes with strings attached. If
     <a href="Mage/Egypt/Priestesses.html#laylah">
      Laylah
     </a>
     is involved with Philippe, she can bring in some help
  from her friends (including some secret help from the
  Priestesses). Another figure worth reckoning with is the
  enigmatic
     <a href="Mage/Egypt/Secret.html#khaled">
      Mr Rifaie
     </a>
     , who might be a great help or a huge block,
  depending on how he is handled.
    </p>
    <p>
     In order to keep the plan secret, both projects should ideally
  be economically and politically entirely independent. If they are
  too obvious, other groups will investigate, and if any connection
  is noticed then people will get
     <i>
      really
     </i>
     interested.
  Obfuscation is second nature to many hermetics, so this will
  likely be fairly easy to hide. The problem is being able to
  control the project too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Buying the land of Turah is another problem. There are several
  local landowners, and some might not want to sell. If the efforts
  to buy the land are too obvious, the locals might band together
  to raise the price or even prevent the buy.
    </p>
    <p>
     This subplot consists mainly of mundane planning, social
  roleplaying (How to deal with the chain-smoking minor Egyptian
  bureaucrat who has decided to delay the survey permit just out of
  spite? What to wear on the fancy dress ball arranged by the
  director of the Bank of Egypt?) and some intrigue. This is a
  great chance to really get into the mysteries of Egyptian
  bureaucracy, financing, politics and land development. The most
  important lessons are of course the importance of contacts, and
  avoiding stepping on too many toes; it is easy to earn minor
  enemies when starting a big project, and they will get back at
  you later.

    <h3>
     The Seven Names of Horus
    </h3>
    To develop the consecration
  ritual, the seven most holy names of Horus are needed (these are
  not the True Name of Horus, but signifies seven aspects of the
  god linked to the pyramids). But these secret names are not
  widely known, and learning them is hard.
    <p>
     If the characters are already very busy, then this section
  could be left to the Masters who will vanish in search for the
  names. This is also an useful way of making them rely less on the
  masters if they treat them as an ever-present cavalry or free
  mentors; now they are on their own. Otherwise this could provide
  a mythical quest through the Egyptian mythology, far from the
  everyday concerns of the material world.
    </p>
    <h4>
     Research
    </h4>
    Research suggests that they were never revealed
  by the mages who knew them. They are likely in the Book of Thoth.
    <h4>
     Prayer
    </h4>
    Praying for guidance to a relevant god (Horus,
  Isis, and especially Thoth) might give a vision or a dream
  sending the characters on a quest to Edfu.
    <h4>
     The Watchers
    </h4>
    Asking the
    <a href="Mage/Egypt/Beings.html#watchers">
     Watchers
    </a>
    is a perilous but interesting alternative to umbral
  quests. Once called and asked they will admit they do not know
  the names, but can find somebody who does - for a price: they
  must get an imam to preach for them in the desert.
    <p>
     If the characters can somehow get the imam to preach for the
  invisible Watchers (just because they are mentioned in the Quran
  doesn't mean every imam will believe in them, or be willing to
  preach), they will in turn lead the character through the deep
  desert to a small hovel where a withered old man lives utterly
  alone (it is not certain if this is in the real world or
  somewhere else). The hermit indeed knows the seven names but will
  only reveal them if the characters can defeat him in a Contest of
  Names; if they fail, he will get their True Names. "For am I not
  the Guardian of Names?" he asks rhetorically. The Contest of
  Names is the classical naming of opposing forces, where the next
  true name must be something that overcomes the previous; there is
  great potential here for trickery on both sides. At the same
  times, a tiny scorpion sent by Set listens from a crack in the
  wall, hoping to overhear something useful to its god.
    </p>
    <h4>
     Questing
    </h4>
    A quest to the divine realm might be a way to
  learn the names firsthand. It could start in the shrine of Horus
  at Edfu, moving through the Egyptian umbra past scenes from the
  life of Horus. The mages will have to overcome many dangers in
  their way to the land beyond the horizon, but each scene will
  reveal one of the names, until they reach the god himself to
  learn the final name.
    <div class="c2">
     The great temple of Horus at Edfu is said to be located at the
    first place where land rose from the waters of Nun (like
    several other temples claim). As the characters pass through
    into the Umbra they find themselves on a tiny mound of mud in
    an infinite ocean of black water. On a perch of reed a falcon
    lands, but two snakes slither up from the sea to attack it;
    from nowhere the "Great white", Horus sacred mace, and a spear
    appear to defend him. This is the first name:
     <b>
      Primordial
    Holder of the Mace and the Spear
     </b>
     , associated with the moon.
    The characters have to deal with other snakes before moving on
    after the falcon, which flies into a stand of reeds.
     <p>
      The next scene is an immense swamp, a labyrinth of reeds,
    channels and small silt islands. Finding ones way is hard, and
    there are many dangerous animals around. Suddenly they come
    upon a small islet where they find a beautiful woman in dirtied
    finery nursing a small child, the baby Horus. The characters
    will have to defend themselves and the family against the
    spirit crocodiles, snakes and scorpions of the swamp. This name
    is
      <b>
       The Widow's Son
      </b>
      (characters familiar with Masonry
    will immediately see the connection with the Masonic myth), and
    it is linked to Mercury. If the characters defend the family
    very valiantly Isis might give them a gift of some kind, like
    the Box of the Seven Scorpions.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the next scene the child has grown to a young infant,
    standing alone and silent. On his head a real cobra forms a
    royal uraeus, and around him the wild animals of the swamp lie
    mastered. He will smile enigmatically, and the sun rises behind
    him through the mists. This secret name is
      <b>
       Horus of the
    Young Sun
      </b>
      and is linked to Venus. He makes a gesture to the
    characters, beckoning them to follow him through the reeds.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the other side Horus is a grown man, powerful and armed
    with his magickal weapons. On the other side of the small
    island stands Set, armed with an immense bronze club. The two
    contenders rush towards each other, using all their might. The
    earth trembles, and the gods shift shapes to better defeat
    their opponent. During the fight the characters are themselves
    confronted with minions of Set, Egyptian warriors wearing
    animal masks of hippopotami, crocodiles and the Set-animal.
    They have to elude them or in some way defeat them. Eventually
    Horus kills Set, and proceeds to hack the body into tiny
    pieces. This secret name is
      <b>
       The Vanquisher of the One With
    Club
      </b>
      and is linked with Mars.
     </p>
     <p>
      The next scene is a grandiose palace, filled with all the
    Egyptian splendour imaginable. On the throne Horus sits
    together with the goddess Hathor, crowned with the crown of the
    two kingdoms. The secret name here is
      <b>
       Ruler of the Just of
    the Two Lands
      </b>
      and is linked to Jupiter.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the next scene Horus is suddenly old and wrinkled. But
    his power is greater than before, and as the characters watch
    his eyes become the sun and the moon, his flesh turns into pure
    blinding light. The secret name here is
      <b>
       The Countenance of
    the Sky
      </b>
      and is linked to Saturn. If a character does not
    look away he will be blinded.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the final scene Horus is a winged sub-disk, fighting an
    immense battle with the forces of darkness at the centre of the
    universe. The characters are surrounded by a vast cosmos of
    spirits, divinities, realms and forces involved in all kinds of
    activities; watching, fighting, praying, making love, doing
    magick, revealing secrets - everything. The threat here is
    subtle: in this realm everything might be possible, the
    greatest secrets learned, the gods befriended, but all these
    seductive possibilities distract from the real goal of learning
    the name and are illusions. If the mages forget what they were
    there for, they will be trapped. Continue describing all the
    wonders to the players, but without referring explicitly to
    Horus at the centre beyond the initial description. The only
    way of overcoming the realm is to concentrate on the centre,
    where the Horus-disc gyres. If the mages concentrate on it,
    they will learn the seventh name:
      <b>
       Horus, Centre of All
    Things
      </b>
      (linked to the Sun). And suddenly they stand in the
    temple of Edfu before a wall showing Horus Behudety, the solar
    disc.
     </p>
    </div>
    <h3>
     Magickal Preparations
    </h3>
    The building of the pyramids will
  require significant magickal power and warding. It would be a
  great idea if the characters could get hold of Tass to use,
  suitable sacrifices to consecrate the foundation stones and build
  powerful wards to keep attention turned away from the building
  sites.
    <p>
     Finding Tass in Egypt is both simpler and trickier than
  finding Tass elsewhere. In Egypt there are significant amounts of
  free Quintessence around, but getting it is usually trickier than
  in the west. The Pyramids are immense nodes, but their
  Quintessence is already being channelled into various magick. The
  Mosques sometimes accumulate Tass in the form of holy water or
  other relics, but for obvious reasons it is not advisable to
  steal it. Several archaeological finds contain significant
  amounts of Tass, but most have been sanitised by the Technocracy
  or are in private possession. There are a few nodes where the
  Masters could gather Quintessence, but many are under
  surveillance.
    </p>
    <p>
     The wards need to keep the building hidden from the attention
  of other Awakened groups. This requires both a shield to mute
  flashes of Prime (and possibly Paradox) from the building site,
  and magickal cloaking that makes others overlook the site. The
  first kind of ward is mainly a Prime effect, traditionally linked
  to grounding the Quintessence fluctuations in the earth or
  flowing water (like the Nile, which is ideal for this). The
  second ward is a Correspondence-Mind effect. A third kind of ward
  might be needed for defence, preventing intruders. Designing
  these wards and setting them up is important and will involve the
  entire group.
    </p>
    <h3>
     The Foundation
    </h3>
    Part II ends once the foundation stone is
  laid for one of the pyramids. As the actual work begins to build
  the pyramids, the chronicle moves on to Part III
    <hr>
     <a name="part iii">
     </a>
     <h2 class="c1">
      <img alt="" src="Mage/Egypt/sunwing.gif">
       <br>
        Part III: Horus
       </br>
      </img>
     </h2>
     This part deals with the building of the two
  remaining pyramids and the completion of the Plan. It relies on
  the groundwork laid in Part I and II; if that is bad, then the
  Armorers will run into much trouble, while a solid foundation for
  the project will strengthen it.
     <h3>
      Mundane Problems
     </h3>
     Mages often master the occult better
  than the purely mundane.
     <p>
      Organising the building projects is a taxing task for even an
  experienced administrator, and when the also have an occult
  agenda things get even trickier. There are wages to pay,
  accidents, spurious complaints from the inhabitants of Turah,
  misdirected supplies, surprise inspections from government
  bureaucrats and everything else that has made builders
  grey-haired since Imhotep built the first pyramid. But the
  building must not be disrupted magickally; Set will likely try to
  sabotage the building somehow, by inserting rowdy and violent
  agents among the workforce in the hope of undermining morale and
  sabotage the project, by causing accidents intended to disrupt
  work or by adding sewer waste to concrete shipments, hoping to
  desecrate the site. The Armorers must be vigilant.
     </p>
     <p>
      Another problem is getting access to the other 5 pyramids.
  They need to be secretly cleansed and (in the case of Abu Ruwash)
  partially rebuilt at least in the Umbra. The pyramids at Gizeh
  and Saqqarah are surrounded by the tourism apparatus, guarded and
  climbing them is forbidden except with special permission from
  the Department of Antiquities (this is also needed to enter the
  Djoser pyramid). The characters need to bribe, manipulate or
  otherwise gain undisturbed access to the sites at least for the
  final ritual. Abu Ruwash is closed to the public and will likely
  require some official permissions to visit.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Occult Problems
     </h3>
     Abu Ruwash has been badly damaged in
  fairly recent times; in the Umbra it is still a pyramid. In order
  to work it has to be re- consecrated and at least partially
  rebuilt. Ideally Brian Griffin would lead an archaeological dig
  at the site to get access and an undisturbed workspace, but that
  will require significant paperwork and some clever subterfuge.
     <p>
      Strengthening the other pyramids is simpler; it is mostly a
  matter of symbolically pouring consecrated oil and removing some
  of the most disruptive rocks. However, the fines for littering or
  vandalism of Egypt's monuments are harsh, so discretion is
  required.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is also during the building a confrontation with the other
  traditions is likeliest. If not before, the Shayks of the White
  Night will take contact with the characters even if they do not
  know about the project, and try to convince them to join forces
  with them in an anti-Technocratic jihad. While Hasan would just
  want to invite the western mages to a meeting, Mohammad might
  choose to interpret his order as kidnapping one or more mages to
  force them to a meeting (something that will greatly irritate his
  father, who will immediately apologise for the grievous
  error).
     </p>
     <p>
      The
      <a href="Mage/Egypt/Nephandi.html#dogs">
       Dogs of Shaitan
      </a>
      will also likely be inspired by the forces of
  Nun to strike against the characters in various ways, ranging
  from desecration to murder attempts. If their nature is
  discovered, a general attack against the Nephandi could serve as
  an excellent diversion for the Shayks and possibly Technocracy.
      <a id="purification" name="purification">
      </a>
     </p>
     <h3>
      The Purification
     </h3>
     The Pattern must be purified before it
  can be consecrated. This means many disruptive influences must be
  removed, both physically and spiritually. Unfortunately Set has
  had several millennia to desecrate the Pattern.
     <p>
      Most of the old desecrations have been washed away by time,
  and only the major ones are really important. Some graffiti on a
  pyramid or the presence of a small town inside the Pattern
  doesn't matter, it is simply too large. But there are at least
  two real problems.
     </p>
     <p>
      The most recent and important desecration is the Asal garbage
  dump north of Gizeh. It is located on top of the Sword of Orion,
  a symbolic desecration of Horus' Sekhem. It is a typical dump,
  with piles of garbage, flocks of birds pecking at it and a
  general attack on the nose. It is owned by the Asal family, a
  Copt family who has a thriving business of garbage collection and
  dumping. An old uncle acts as its single guard/worker, while the
  rest of the family drive the trucks, haul garbage or do the
  accounting.
     </p>
     <p>
      It was fairly trivial for Set to subtly influence events
  around 20 years ago to get the dump started, and it is a great
  success. Mages can feel the entropic taint of the dump as garbage
  mixes with desert sand - this place must be cleansed before the
  Pattern is consecrated, or Horus will be severely desecrated if
  he manifests in the physical world.
     </p>
     <p>
      Getting rid of the dump is not easy. The Asal family will not
  sell it; they live off the garbage traffic and would not be able
  to prosper without their own dump. It might be possible to offer
  another one in exchange, but that would likely look suspicious.
  It is conceivable that the government could be made to step in
  and close it (for example by showing that it is a health hazard
  or bad for tourism), even if that would be a disaster to the
  family and likely not clean it up. Just sneaking in and letting
  loose Prime, Forces, Spirit and Entropy might solve the problem
  briefly, but the Asal family will likely continue to use it. The
  garbage has to be removed, and the dump must be closed. One
  solution suggested by the play-testers was to use the connections
  of the Order of Hermes in the EEC to institute a few minor
  details in the new environmental program for the development
  grants to the Mediterranean countries, suddenly making it very
  profitable for the Asals to export the garbage to another dump; a
  few hints and some bribes to the right bureaucrats, and everybody
  got happy.
     </p>
     <p>
      The second major problem is hidden. Beneath one of the
  ley-lines between the pyramids in the desert lies the tomb of
  Asal-Apophras-Set, one of the priests of Set who was given an
  eternal duty: to recite the curses and maledictions against Horus
  forever, making completion of the Pattern impossible. If any
  quintessence is sent through the ley-line, it is cursed and given
  a resonance of Set. The tomb can only be found if the Armorers
  walk along the lines, finding the remaining problems (if the
  characters do not suggest this, the Masters will). How they find
  it will depend on how they search; the presence of something
  inimical is subtle but could be detected both by Entropy, Mind,
  Spirit or Prime, or by an omen like the cry of a falcon or the
  sudden attack of a snake. In the Umbra a faint chanting in
  ancient Egyptian can be heard.
     </p>
     <p>
      Dealing with the tomb is tricky, albeit more magickal than the
  waste dump. It is inhabited by a live Osirian, who is very much
  active and likely has the paradigm on its side inside. Getting
  sleepers to investigate is one possibility, but that could result
  in a major dig right on top of one of the central ley-lines
  (including the risk of technomancers sanitising the grave, thus
  placing a block for the ley-line). Going into the tomb will lead
  to a magickal fight, which may be exciting but very dangerous.
  And once the characters discover the dead priest, he will be
  aware of their presence and immediately begin to stretch his
  shadowy feelers into the physical world to do them harm. The most
  likely event is a magickal storming of the grave, seeking to
  silence the osirian and if possible banish him.
      <a id="consecration" name="consecration">
      </a>
     </p>
     <h3>
      The Great Consecration
     </h3>
     This is the climax. The ritual is
  one of the greatest magickal acts ever undertaken. Not just the
  Armorers, but mages from all times contribute to the ritual,
  helped by millennia of acolytes and prayers. The forces involved
  are enormous; should the ritual fail now, the disaster will be of
  global proportions. If it succeeds the change will be global. Do
  your best to describe the epic dimensions of what happens - how
  the stones of the pyramids hum with power, the flickering of
  spirits and gods just behind reality, immense flows of
  Quintessence and how Destiny itself seems to guide every
  movement. Once the ritual is underway reality will become
  extremely fluid thanks to the enormous amounts of quintessence
  and magick involved; magick will more be a question about what
  characters describe than die rolls.
     <p>
      The characters should work together with the Masters to
  arrange the ceremony properly. Beside the obvious practicalities
  of getting censers, ceremonial robes, hermetic regalia proper for
  each person and bringing them to the tops of the pyramids (not to
  mention bribing enough be allowed there), they have to figure out
  how to guard the ritual, what wards to set up and how to signal
  each other. It is likely a good idea to complete the two pyramids
  as part of the ritual; activating them before would attract undue
  attention - it is hard to hide a real pyramid from mages,
  regardless of how it looks.
     </p>
     <p>
      The ritual begins as the stars of Orion first rise above the
  horizon. On each of the seven pyramids there are mages,
  representing the planets and occult forces. At Chefren Philippe
  (and if possible, Laylah) stands representing the sun. At
  Saqqarah Rebecca stands representing Mercury. At Turah Arthur and
  Archimedes Cavendish stand representing Jupiter. At Cheops Jean
  stands representing Mars. At Mykerinos Alicia represents Venus.
  At Abu Ruwash Trond and McPatric represent Saturn. At the desert
  Pyramid Griffin and Weith represents the Moon. If they have set
  up a temple of Sothis in Cairo one of the mages should be
  there.
     </p>
     <p>
      During the ritual the power builds. At first the wards and
  magickal veils will hide what is happening, but at a certain
  point it will become too big to conceal anymore. Mages in Egypt
  will start to feel the energy being channelled. At Aswan the
  construct technicians will watch in horror as quintessence begins
  to leave the Dam instead of accumulating, in Cairo the Shayks
  will gather on rooftops, trying to discern the source while the
  Dogs of Shaitain howl in the alleys. Now comes the great test:
  the mages must complete the ritual even as other groups begins to
  realise what is happening.
     </p>
     <p>
      The most obvious threat is the Void Engineer strike force at
  Helwan. It will take them just a quarter of an hour to reach
  Turah and half an hour to get to Gizeh (if the Turah pyramid is
  hidden well enough; if nothing of the Plan has been revealed
  comptroller Jeremy might be convinced the trouble comes from the
  three big pyramids). It consists of an armoured vehicle manned by
  men in black, void engineer sanitizers and HIT Marks dressed up
  like police; if they could disrupt just one of the rituals the
  whole ritual will fail. The challenge for the characters is to
  defend themselves without breaking the great rite. To their
  support they have preparation, enormous amounts of quintessence
  and a paradigm which is quickly becoming more and more flexible -
  it might turn out that the strike force will fall prey to the
  Sphinx or (if one of the characters realises it and prays) divine
  intervention.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the same time Set gathers all his forces in a last
  desperate attack from the desert. Set will do anything to stop
  the ritual, but lacks the time to do it with finesse. A storm
  rages towards the Pattern, hiding his minions: masked Bedouins,
  dwellers of Tuat, camels of pestilence, snakes, scorpions and
  djinns. This battle is similar to the one against the
  technocracy, but here dynamic magick will used by both sides.
     </p>
     <p>
      As the attack occurs, Set tries to seed doubts in the minds of
  the mages. He will bring up visions of past acts, trying to
  remind them of things they have done that were counter to the
  ideals of the Armorers and Horus. Are they really worthy and
  pure? He will try to show them their insecurities. What if they
  fail? Can they really finish the ritual? And he is not beyond
  revealing the injustice done to the Seti people by the followers
  of Horus, showing the story from
      <i>

      perspective. Should
  the Armorers really invoke Horus the Avenger? What if he is cruel
  and aloof?

      If a character is overcome by the visions and gives in, that
  part of the Pattern begins to weaken and will fall unless another
  mage can step in and take his or her place. There must be a mage
  on every pyramid to complete the pattern (vulgar correspondence
  suddenly becomes very useful). If the Pattern holds, then the
  storm will dwindle, leaving confused and frightened minions to
  fend or flee for themselves.

      At the climax of the ritual the pyramids and ley-lines
  suddenly erupt Quintessence which grounds as strange auroras
  across the Nile valley and pyramids. The earth trembles with a
  resonant rumble. From high above the cry of a falcon is heard.
  Master Cavendish raises his hands intoning a single syllable and
  falls down dead. In the sky Betelgeuse flares into brilliance, so
  brightly that it casts shadows. The Eye of Horus has been opened.
  All the participating mages feel a Presence tower above them -
  immense, titanic, triumphant but also just and... grateful. It is
  as if the whole of Egypt has awakened.

      Across the planet mages feel the shift. In busy command
  centrals deep beneath the ground or in space technocracy analysts
  watches their monitors in fear and surprise as something ripples
  through the quintessence fields of the Earth. For a moment the
  Nephandi falter and feel doubts in their labyrinths and pits. In
  hidden chantries and horizon realms tradition mages feel
  something strange in the air; some welcome it, others have dark
  misgivings. In the Underworld a new star burns brightly on the
  sky, and from one of the new pyramids a great magician descends,
  the osirians bowing before him as he walks towards the anchored
  Bark of the Sun.

      In cities everywhere people take to the streets or flock to
  windows to see the new star; tomorrow the headlines will tell of
  Betelgeuse going supernova, but tonight it is a brilliant
  mystery. In Cairo people flock to the prayer-houses and mosques
  to hear the words of the imams. Somewhere the cry "Michael is
  with us!" is heard and repeated thousandfold; across the city
  green flags appear as if from nowhere. And despite the Assuan
  Dam, the Nile begins to rise.
