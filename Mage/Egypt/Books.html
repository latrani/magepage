   A book is of more value than the house of a master-builder or a
    tomb in the western desert... Is there anyone around today like
    Hor-dedef? Is there anyone else like Imhotep? ... Those wise
    men who foretold the future. ... They might be gone and their
    names fade from memory - except that their writings keep them
    remembered.

  To a hermetic mage books are not just knowledge,
  they are sources of revelation and power.

  <h2>
   The Book of Thoth
  </h2>
  The Book of Thoth is the single most
  powerful tome ever written, easily surpassing all others. It is
  said to be an ancient papyrus roll written by the great god
  himself. The book is one of the most powerful tomes ever written,
  revealing some of them profound secrets and true names of ancient
  Egyptian magick, including the ritual to consecrate a pyramid to
  tie it into the Tapestry.
  <p>
   According to one story
   <a href="Mage/Egypt/Imhotep.html">
    Imhotep
   </a>
   first became enlightened when he read it. It was at
  first hidden in a lead box on the bottom of the Nile, protected
  by snakes, scorpions and crocodiles, but later it was hidden in a
  secret room in the Temple of Hermopolis (likely by Imhotep).
  According to the myth, it was found again by king Khufu, who used
  it to build his pyramid. His descendant Khafre hid it in its
  original box beneath the Sphinx. It is believed to have been read
  by Hermes Trismegistros, but he hid it again somewhere. The
   <a href="Mage/Egypt/Batini.html#architects">
    Architects of Divine Measure
   </a>
   found it, learned from it but
  didn't dare to use its full potential and hid it again. It
   <i>
    might
   </i>
   be in the Library of Alexandria, but the High
  Librarians refuse to comment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Today the Book is the archetypal great secret everybody seeks;
  there have been several well-funded and prestigious expeditions
  into Egypt just to discover its whereabouts; it is the holy grail
  for many members of the Order of Hermes (not to mention the
  Batini, who officially deride the book-seekers as "bookworms"
  while themselves looking for it).
  </p>
  <p>
   Availability: one unknown copy. Possibly some excerpts are
  known to the Architects.

  <h2>
   De Pyramidis et Secretum Aegyptorum (Vol. I-V)
  </h2>
  This is
  the seminal work in the Order of Hermes about pyramidology,
  written in the twenties by Jonathan Hartwright- Carter of the
  Library of Alexandria.
  <p>
   Hartwright-Carter spent most of his life working in Egypt
  gathering this information, making numerous expeditions up the
  Nile and seeking cooperation with the Batini. The result is a
  somewhat confusing but very complete study, including much
  Egyptian folklore, old legends about strange events around the
  pyramids and accounts of umbral expeditions. It contains
  elaborate drawings and maps of the pyramids and temples, gathered
  observations about their occult powers and hermetic theories
  about how they work and their purposes. It was published on his
  deathbed, and to the last he sought to make additions and
  improvements.
  </p>
  <p>
   The book contains many important discoveries and rotes. It
  describes how to use the pyramids to reach the Tuat (and through
  the Tuat presumably the Land of Reeds of the Dead and the lands
  of the gods), although Hartwright-Carter never dared to leave the
  vicinity of the pyramids in his explorations of the netherworld.
  It is surprisingly simple to use the pyramids in this way: one
  just has to enter them normally, and then go into the Umbra.
  There one must follow a prescribed path through the umbral
  chambers, giving various guardians passwords from the Book of the
  Dead, leaving through the spiritual gates of the North and South
  and finally invoking Anubis for guidance and support.
  </p>
  <p>
   Availability: Fairly common in the Order of Hermes. The book
  can be found both in the library of the
   <a href="Mage/Egypt/Order.html#luxor%20club">
    Luxor Club
   </a>
   ,

  <h2>
   The Book of the Dead
  </h2>
  This book is the ultimate survival
  guide in the Tuat, and without it the traveller will surely get
  lost and perish. It should be noted that there exist many
  incorrect translations, and in the underworld there are myriads
  of restless dead who seek a personal copy, no matter what they
  have to do. Judging which compilation which is true is a very
  hard problem.
  <p>
   Availability: Very common, but most versions are incorrect.

  <h2>
   De Vermis Mysteriis by Ludvig Prinn
  </h2>
  This ancient and
  infamous tome contains many important observations about magick,
  the umbrae, spirits and medieval Arabian magick. According to
  legend it was penned in prison as the author awaited execution in
  1542, having been charged with sorcery by the Inquisition.
  Somehow he smuggled out the book past the guards, and it was
  later copied by other mages. It is known to be both dangerous and
  confusing, since it contains just about everything jumbled
  together: geographical observations, rotes, hedge magic, history,
  various myths, descriptions of spirits and rituals and several
  bizarre hermetic theories.
  <p>
   The final chapter, "Saracenic rituals", contains what the
  author claims he learned from Arabic wizards during his captivity
  in Syria and travels to Alexandria during the crusades (he
  claimed to be several hundred years old). It contains detailed
  descriptions of the summoning and binding of the efreet and
  djinn, information about the priesthoods of Sobek and Bast,
  mentions the Cult of Nun and the worm-wizards of Irem and some of
  the secret history of Egypt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Availability: Very rare. The Library of Alexandria is likely
  to have a copy, but it is not shown to visitors.

  <h2>
   The Scroll of Djadja-em-ankh
  </h2>
  An ancient papyrus
  containing the spells of Djadja-em-ankh, court magician of king
  Sneferu (the father of king Khufu the pyramid builder; some of
  the mage-priests achievements are listed in the Berlin papyrus).
  One is especially famous, it allows the magician to divide water
  - it will divide the water into walls so that anybody can walk
  dry-shod across the former bottom, and when the spell is
  concluded the water will move back. The similarities to Moses
  dividing the Red Sea are striking. Other spells deal with
  mummification, preventing accidents and divining the future. Most
  are simple utility spells, while some are fairly unique.
  <p>
   Availability: Rare. One copy is owned by the Luxor Club.

  <h2>
   The Book of Am-Duat
  </h2>
  This book describes the Tuat and its
  denizens. It states that it contains "Knowledge of the power of
  those in the underworld. Knowledge of their actions - knowing the
  sacred rituals for Re, knowing the hidden dynamism, knowing the
  hours and gods, knowing the gates and paths where the great god
  passes, knowing the powerful and destroyed". While several
  complete versions are known among sleeper researchers, the true
  meaning of the often obscure symbolism is very hard to understand
  without extensive hermetic and egyptologic knowledge or a
  magickal concordance.
  <p>
   Availability: The book itself is available among sleepers, but
  the full concordance is uncommon even among the Order of Hermes.

  <h2>
   Book of the Divine Cow
  </h2>
  Another ancient Egyptian spellbok,
  aimed at protecting the body of the sovereign and help his
  rebirth and ascension to the sun-boat in the heavens. The book
  also details the myth of the cataclysm when Re almost destroyed
  mankind, but finally relented and helped prevent the goddess
  Sekhmet from destroying all humans; Re then retired from Egypt
  leaving Thoth as the overseer of humanity.
  <p>
   Availability: Several partial versions are known to sleeper
  scholars, but the Library of Alexandria and the Luxor Club have
  complete copies which might be invaluable for mages attempting
  the full mummification ritual.
