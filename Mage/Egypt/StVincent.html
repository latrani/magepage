  <h1>
   St. Vincent Manor
  </h1>
  The Manor lies ten kilometres east of
  Cambridge, surrounded by a small forest/park which gives way to a
  very strict but beautiful garden around the manor proper. The
  building is a middle sixteenth century manor, with a great
  colonnade and several wings. It is a pleasant place to retreat
  from the outside world, and its library is quite recognised among
  English hermetics.
  <p>
   Quintessence is provided by several standing stones in the
  vicinity, but the chantry doesn't gather enough to afford an
  entire realm; instead some of the inner rooms exist only
  partially in reality.

   </a>
   The Seraphis Society, the
  central cabal of the chantry, has for a long time sought to help
  Sleepers through hermetic means. They have so far succeeded
  mainly at influencing English society in a hermetic direction,
  but the more optimistic members claim that more and more people
  at key positions have been illuminated by the secret truths.
  Their critics claim the Society mainly engages in the creation of
  Old School Tie-networking.

  <p>
   <a name="scribes of thoth">
   </a>
   The Scribes of Thoth guard and
  tend the library, seeking out new tomes to include and organising
  the hermetic truths in better ways. They are doing their best to
  network with other hermetic chantries (most notably the Library
  of Alexandria) in this pursuit, with mixed success.
