   Spirits and Beings of the Egyptian Umbra
  </h1>
  <a id="djinn" name="djinn">
  </a>
  <h2>
   Djinn
  </h2>
  The Djinn are the elemental spirits of the desert;
  ranging from mischievous dust-devils to roaring and deadly
  storms. They represent furious urges unfettered by thinking,
  serving none but are somewhat linked to Set and other destructive
  forces; usually they just try to make life hard for people.
  Across the Arabian world there are many different descriptions of
  Djinni, and other forms seem to exist on the seas (where they can
  appear as ships with burning lamps), in the mountains or on
  islands. In the deserts of the material world they appear as
  small tornadoes, snakes, pillars of sandy air or as roaring
  storms, depending on power and mood.
  <p>
   Charms: Create wind, Updraft. Disorient
  </p>
  <p>
   A Djinn can create winds, ranging from small gusts to huge
  storms, carry away people or objects and change landmarks so that
  travellers get lost.
   <a id="watchers" name="watchers">
   </a>
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Watchers
  </h2>
  The Watchers are often confused with the
  Djinn, but are really a separate order of being (some mage call
  them the true Djinn, and the lesser Djinn are seen as mere
  elementals or subservient spirits). Unlike the Djinn they cannot
  manifest physically even with the help of magick, and they
  usually appear as Arabian people dressed in opulent clothes and
  speaking in a cultured manner (but unable to utter the name of
  Allah). They are quite proficient in magick, and can shapeshift
  into animals or storms (which is most likely the reason they are
  confused with the lesser djinn, who often serve the Watchers
  grudgingly). Beside their shapeshifting, they are often extremely
  skilled in Matter, able to create the most magnificent treasures
  or buildings instantly; according to one story they helped king
  Salomon build his temple.
  <p>
   They live just on the other side of the Gauntlet, perpetually
  watching the affairs of humans and fey (they get along fabulously
  with the Eshu) and learning their secrets. According to the myth
  they were created before mankind by Allah but lacked souls,
  something they deeply envy the humans. According to the Al- Anam
  sura of the Quran, it is forbidden for the Watchers and humans to
  interact with each other. While the elder watchers (if elder has
  any meaning among immortals) respect the Will of Allah and remain
  faithful (according to the Al-Djinn sura even the Watchers can
  reach salvation) there are some Watchers who instead seek to
  escape their existence and gladly deal with humans or other
  beings. They can create marvellous things, teach profound secrets
  and generally aid people, but their works are often subtly cursed
  with ill luck even when they mean no harm.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some Watchers have attempted, after much eloquence, to trade
  some of their power for the soul of a person. In the few cases it
  has occurred, the Watcher became fully human (and with ordinary
  human capabilities and frailties), while the human became an
  immaterial Watcher - powerful but forever cut off from mankind.
  On the other hand, some Arabian mages have learned how to summon
  and imprison Watchers into talismans such as lamps, flasks or
  rings, forcing them to do their owner's bidding.
  </p>
  <p>
   Charms: as Master mages, usually very skilled in Matter. They
  can shapeshift into whatever they desire.
   <a id="snake" name="snake">
   </a>
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Stone Snake
  </h2>
  This wise and powerful being protects
  certain places and objects from intruders. It appears like a huge
  snake, at least sixteen meters long, covered with lapis lazuli
  scales, eyes of emeralds, teeth of diamond and powdered rubies as
  blood. It wears a one meter beard like an Egyptian god. In fact,
  it likely closely related to the Watchers or perhaps a Watcher
  itself.
  <p>
   Normally it resides on the Island of the Ka, an enchanted
  island in the umbral ocean. The island is a veritable garden of
  eden filled with ripe figs, grapes, vegetables, cucumbers and an
  abundance of fish and wildfowl. According to the myth there were
  originally 75 similar snakes, but all but one were destroyed by a
  falling star. Today it seldom leaves the island, but some old
  spells still bind it to intervene to protect.
  </p>
  <p>
   Charm: Airt sense, Armor, Healing, Materialize, Mind speech,
  Master level Matter and Life.
   <a id="crocodiles" name="crocodiles">

  </p>
  <h2>
   Spirit Crocodiles
  </h2>
  These beings live in or near the Nile
  in the Umbra. They prey on other beings, dragging them beneath
  the surface of the umbral Nile into the watery depths. While they
  do not necessarily serve Nun, they are beings of death,
  voraciousness and cunning. Sometimes they venture up from the
  Nile into the Cairo Umbra to prowl the alleyways, preying on the
  unfortunates nobody misses.
  <p>
   Charms: armour, flood, tracking
   <a id="camels" name="camels">
   </a>
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Camels of Pestilence
  </h2>
  These disgusting creatures are
  the manifestations of disease in the city; their forms are based
  on the ancient tradition of leading a camel through all parts of
  a city haunted by pestilence (thus infusing it with disease) and
  finally strangling it on a holy ground, hopefully killing the
  disease with it. But some camels have returned to hunt the umbra,
  appearing as walking camel carcasses with bloody ropes tied
  around their necks. Where they appear, disease appears, and they
  gain sustenance from the weakening of sick people.
  <p>
   Charms: Cause Disease
  </p>
  <p>
   By using this charm, the Camel can induce a contagious disease
  in a victim. Causing a cold or bowel unrest requires 2 points of
  Power, while incurable diseases such as AIDS requires 20 points
  of Power. The victim can resist the disease with his or her
  Stamina, difficulty depending on the disease. The Camel gains one
  point of power for each health-level lost due to disease in their
  vicinity.

  </p>
  <h2>
   Guardian Angels
  </h2>
  These beings are invoked by imams to
  protect the faithful from the dangers of the Djinn and other
  umbral beings, or sent by Allah. They walk around their
  protégé in the Umbra, shielding from attack and
  corruption.
  <p>
   Charms varies, but common angelic charms include: Armour,
  Healing, Cleanse the blight, Influence (advice or conscience),
  Spirit Static.
   <a id="sphinx" name="sphinx">
   </a>
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Sphinx
  </h2>
  The Sphinx is the most powerful guardian
  spirit in the world, protecting the three central pyramids from
  magickal attacks. In the Umbra its real self is visible, a huge
  lion-man hybrid filled with inscrutable watchfulness and power.
  Its face is no longer entirely human, and looks more like a lion
  than in the physical world.
  <p>
   It is unknown how old it is, but according to some hermetic
  scholars it is much older than the pyramids, possibly dating back
  to the ancient times when the gods walked the earth and the
  desert flowered. According to one myth, it remained behind when
  the age of gods ended in the Aeon of Leo to guard the land
  against some unknown threat. According to another theory, it is
  awaiting the time when the gods will return. The Sphinx isn't
  telling.
  </p>
  <p>
   While it most of the time just watches the Nile, anybody
  approaching the pyramids with a destructive intent in the Umbra
  is attacked with ferocious force. It seldom speaks, but when it
  does it usually speaks in riddles and mysteries, often mentioning
  the constellations of the stars and the Nile.

  <h2>
   Dwellers of the Tuat
  </h2>
  The Tuat is filled with wretched
  beings, some of them once humans, some its own. They all crave
  life, pleasure, light, anything to escape the dreadful world they
  inhabit. Most of them are just minor entities, not much more than
  an irritating whine or a word repeating itself endlessly, but
  there are also once-humans now warped by millennia of despair
  into howling corpse-things and monstrous beasts longing for the
  taste of soul-flesh. They are trapped in the Tuat unless someone
  leads them out of it somehow; sensitive mages may sense their
  soundless whispers in the remote desert or from the depth of
  refuse pits. Some mages have learned to use these creatures to do
  their dirty work, and Set is especially fond of using them as his
  own expendable servants.
  <p>
   Charms: almost anything
   <a id="ach" name="ach">
   </a>
  </p>
  <h2>
   Ach Spirit
  </h2>
  The ach-iker, the perfected ones, seem to be
  representations of powerful people who have died in spiritual
  perfection. Normally they just move along their own inscrutable
  purposes, but mages who have broken the Law of Maat or suffer
  from paradox can attract their attention. They move against him,
  causing bad luck, accidents and possibly even death; this may be
  the real story behind the "mummy's curse" and a good reason mages
  should thread lightly in the old temples. The ach-iker in the
  physical world are invisible other than as a powerful, aloof
  presence, while in the Umbra they appear as silent, tall, shining
  people dressed in ancient Egyptian finery.
  <p>
   Charms: Curse/Bless (as the Entropy sphere).
   <a id="osirian" name="osirian">
   </a>
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Osirians
  </h2>
  <img align="right" alt="" src="Mage/Egypt/openmouth.gif">
   The Osirians are the noble dead, the dead
  who have been correctly embalmed and consecrated. Their seven
  souls are bound together by magick, making it possible for them
  to travel across the worlds (including the Umbras) and, if they
  still have a mummy or a properly consecrated statue, even the
  material world (although paradox is a big deterrent). Today most
  osirians exist in the
   <a href="Mage/Egypt/Umbra.html#kingdom%20of%20reeds">
    Kingdom of Reeds
   </a>
   , far away from the dealings of mortals, but
  rare occurrences can bring them forth from their habitations.
  Unfortunately they are vulnerable to desecration: if their bodies
  are destroyed they cannot manifest physically, if their graves
  are desecrated they may loose strength, if their name is erased
  they will cease to exist. Time, vandals, puppets of Stygia,
  archaeologists and unbelief has largely exiled the osirians from
  the physical world.
   <p>
    An Osirian consists of several souls joined together in a
  complex way (se Aurelius excellent essay
    <a href="Mage/parts_soul.html">
     The Constituent Parts of Identity
    </a>
    for details):
   </p>
   <div class="c1">
    Ren: the True Name. This aspect is the abstract, nearly
    indestructible identity of the Osirian. As long as there is a
    single inscription anywhere with that name, or a being who
    knows it the Osirian will still exist or have existed. This is
    why it is so important to pass the Hall of Two Truths, so that
    Thoth may enter the name into his scroll. Deliberately erasing
    inscribed names is a way of weakening and potentially defeating
    the dead - most cannot stand it.
    <p>
     Sekhem: the Quintessence making up the individual. To remain
    in existence an Osirian needs a source of Quintessence, either
    by being buried in a sacred place, by being given regular
    sacrifices or by being admitted to the Kingdom of Reeds, which
    acts as a source of Quintessence (in turn empowered by the
    pyramids).
    </p>
    <p>
     Khu: the Avatar. The Khu is not bound by the ritual, and can
    be reborn by following Ra on his eternal cycle of rebirths.
    However, the Khu of an will aid it as long as it exists, even
    if the Khu currently is the avatar of somebody else.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ab: The heart, the Essence of the Avatar. During
    mummification all the organs except the heart are removed. The
    heart acts as the nexus between the body and spiritual aspects
    and ties them together. It was magickally strengthened by
    placing a heart scarab amulet in the bindings; if this is
    removed the link to the body is broken and the can never
    manifest physically.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ba: The psyche, the conscious mind of the person. Together
    with the Ka it could travel through the Umbras, but once in the
    Reed kingdom the Ba could remain there alone, leaving the Ka to
    guard the tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
     Khaibit: The Shadow, the dark part of the mind that wants to
    bring oblivion or dissolution. This aspect must be weakened or
    defeated enough in order to make the last through the Hall of
    two Truths - if it is too strong the heart will be heavier than
    the feather of truth, and the person will become immediately be
    engulfed by the Devourer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ka: the ephemeral form, the double of the body in the Umbra.
    The rituals aim at strengthening it enough to become able to
    withstand the harsh tests of the afterlife, and once the is
    complete to guard the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
     Khat: the physical body. As long as the mummy was
    sufficiently intact, the could inhabit it. It was also possible
    to inhabit statues of oneself, as long as they had been
    consecrated by the Ritual of the Opening of the Mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Söhu: The entropic double, the corpus of existence in
    the netherworld. This is the aspect needed to exist in the
    Tuat.
    </p>
   </div>
   It is worth noting that many of these souls can exist
  independently. A full could have his Ka guarding his grave, his
  Ba in the Land of Reeds and his Khu on the bark of the sun. To
  perform a magickal act the Khu and Ka must be united, and to
  perform it consciously the Ba is also needed. To manifest
  physically they need a body receptacle too.
   <p>
    It is often erroneously believed that osirians are created
  solely by the ritual of embalming. This is only a part of the
  process, albeit crucial for the to be able to return to the world
  into a proper body. The other parts are the necessary will and
  beliefs to remain a single entity and not to disperse into
  nothingness (or to unite with the solar light), and the arduous
  journey of purification that has to be undertaken to gain
  recognition at the court of Osiris. If the latter is not done,
  the will never find his way to the sanctuary of the Reed Kingdom
  and will be forever exposed to the dangers and denizens of the
  Tuat; full osirians can instantly reform in safety of the kingdom
  if attacked. In order to complete the journey many dangers and
  tests must be overcome, and knowledge of the Book of the Dead is
  crucial.
   </p>
   <p>
    Throughout history the secret of osirification has been sought
  by many, but powerful groups have hid it; today it is likely only
  the Priestesses of Isis and possibly the Watchers know it.
  Several mages are known to have undergone reconstructions of the
  ritual, but the eventual success is unknown.
