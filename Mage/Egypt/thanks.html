  <h1>
   Thanks to:
  </h1>
  The great god Thoth, lord of the written and
  digital realm, whose great magick has made it possible for me to
  gather the information of this module.
  <p>
   My players, who without realizing it created half of this
  module themselves during the game.
  </p>
  <p>
   Several millennia of egyptians, who have toiled ceaselessly to
  create history.

  I have borrowed a lot of stuff from
  other sources.
  <p>
   The basic idea of the connection between the Pyramids and
  Orion was based on a television program on the Discovery channel
  about "The Orion Mystery". No, I don't belive in it at all, but
  it makes a good plot for Mage.

   Much of the descriptions of the gods are taken from
   <a href="http://160.227.122.58/egypt/">

   ,
   <a href="http://members.aol.com/egyptart/index.html">

   and
   <a href="http://www.kemet.org">
    The House of Netjer's
  official site
   </a>
   (especially the lists of offerings and
  symbols). I have taken many quotes from

   Robert Ingdahl gave me several very useful descriptions of
  Egypt today and harassed me with interesting questions forcing me
  to study the land in depth.

   Clip art has been taken from

   Yes, there are likely some errors in the descriptions. Not to
  mention stuff that is just plain speculation with no basis in
  reality.
