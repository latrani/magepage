  <h2>
   Master Arthur Edward Cavendish
  </h2>
  <blockquote>
   The highest proof of virtue is to possess boundless power
    without abusing it
   <cite>
    Thomas Babington Macaulay
   </cite>
  </blockquote>
  Arthur has always been conscious of forces. The
  forces that cause events. The forces that shape things. The
  forces that lead us to our destiny. Instead of trying to impose
  his will on the universe, he aligned with the universe and made
  it his will - and became unstoppable.
  <p>
   Arthur grew up as the only son of a well-off farmer just
  outside of London. His quite enlightened father sent him off to
  educate himself, which he did with enormous appetite. Although he
  could not get into the best universities due to his low birth, he
  managed to acquire a prodigious education to the pride of his
  family. But before he managed to become a civil servant or
  academic, he was initiated into a Masonic lodge tied to
  Cambridge. There he met other inquiring, dynamic minds who
  regarded knowledge and drive as more important than background,
  and especially delighted in
   <i>
    understanding
   </i>
   the secrets of
  history and religion, not just to learn them as others did. Quite
  soon, he was a mage of the Order of Hermes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through the years he has become the centre of a dedicated
  group of hermetic mages interested in actually *doing* something
  for the Sleepers, while still being true to the hermetic ideals
  of secrecy and spiritual knighthood. The Alexandrian Lodge, which
  he became involved with in Cambridge evolved into a chantry in
  the late nineteenth century when a wealthy benefactor donated
   <a href="Mage/Egypt/StVincent.html">
    St. Vincent Manor
   </a>
   to it. At the turn of the century he became
  its Chancellor, and has led it ever since.
  </p>
  <p>
   His son had less academic interests and instead became a very
  successful businessman. At first Arthur was surprised, but in
  time both father and son realised that it was a masterstroke:
  this way they could combat the Syndicate in secret on its home
  turf, it gained the chantry significant resources and it provided
  an excellent way of gaining entrance into the circles of high
  finance for hermetic ideas.
  </p>
  <p>
   For the last decades he has been doing his best to both
  influence sleeper society with hermetic ideas, and to bring the
  disparate magickal groups of Britain together. His success has
  been notable, but still an enormous amount of work remains to do.
  And Arthur's time is running out. His magickally extended life is
  becoming too extended, and unless he retreats permanently to a
  Horizon realm he will die. He accepts it with his usual calm. But
  he definitely wants to see the Pattern completed, it would be the
  logical conclusion of his lifework.
  </p>
  <p>
   Appearance: A ruddy, big man in a too tight suit with an
  overflowing, jovial personality. Due to his mastery of Forces the
  air is often warm and slightly dry around him.
  </p>
  <p>
   Roleplaying tips: Be outgoing, active but at the same time
  calm; you have no need to get stressed as long as everything goes
  along your elaborate plans. There is no need to push things,
  persuasion and charisma works much better.

  <h2>
   Master Germund Weith
  </h2>
  <blockquote>
   I am the Hawk-Headed Lord of Silence &amp; of Strength; my
    nemyss shrouds the night-blue sky.
   <cite>
    Aleister Crowley,
    Liber AL vel Legis
   </cite>
  </blockquote>
  While Arthur is active and involved, Germund tends
  to step back and view the whole picture, evaluate it, reach in
  and manipulate a small part and then watch the desired changes to
  occur. He is the ultimate occult manipulator, always aware of the
  secret undercurrents of society and magick. If nobody will ever
  notice his influence, so much better. Germund lives only to
  perfect.
  <p>
   Germund is quite young for a hermetic Master, just 35. He
  awakened just 14 years old when he witnessed a supposedly secret
  hermetic ritual held in a forest in the vicinity of his native
  LÃ¼nenburg; to the surprise of the assembled mages the youth
  with blazing Avatar appeared from the trees and seamlessly took
  part of the ritual. His meteoric rise through the ranks and
  lodges of Ordo Rosae Crucis in Germany also raised quite a few
  eyebrows, as did his sudden decision to resign from his position
  as leader of the Berlin lodges. He spent a few years apparently
  aimlessly wandering between the orders, lodges, houses and
  temples of the Order of Hermes, until he suddenly joined the
  thelemites in Hamburg where he quickly advanced to a respectable
  but obscure position as Keeper of the Law. Among hermetic mages
  he is known as an unusual person, impossible to predict and even
  harder to pin down.
  </p>
  <p>
   The truth is hidden. Already as an apprentice he had a vision:
  an united Order of Hermes, leading the united Traditions towards
  Ascension. To achieve this, he learned everything there was to
  know about order politics, the structure of the Order and how to
  influence things. Then he quit, and visited the various fractions
  and subgroups, carefully learning their strengths and weaknesses,
  and starting to weave a web of interconnections that one day may
  help unite the Order. He joined the thelemites as the next step,
  since they were the group most dynamic and open towards the other
  traditions, a perfect base from which to balance the forces of
  magick and power. Up until now he had been working to strengthen
  the ties between the Cult of Ecstasy with the Order.
  </p>
  <p>
   When Arthur contacted him, it was not because of his abilities
  at occult intrigue, but as a renowned Egyptologist and as widely
  connected mage. Arthur might have suspected some of his designs,
  but in that case he has hid his knowledge well, and used it to
  make Germund one of the driving forces behind the Armorers of
  Orion. Germund quickly realised how the completion of the Pattern
  could help his vision, and has indeed become one of the most
  powerful backers of the Armorers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Even if Germund isn't aware of all aspects of the Egyptian
  Ascension Jihad, he has a certain feeling for it and can provide
  some useful advice and if necessary, help from unexpected
  directions. Without realising it clearly, he has surprised the
  Priestesses of Isis with bringing a Mage of the Blood into Egypt,
  something they had not expected. This has actually forced them to
  protect the Armorers somewhat against the other groups.
  </p>
  <p>
   Appearance: a dark-haired, pale, somewhat skinny man in his
  early thirties with piercing eyes. He usually dresses in
  conservative black clothing, sitting silent in shadow during most
  discussions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Roleplaying tips: Keep to yourself, watching how the others
  interact. Occasionally enter the situation and influence it in
  some obscure way. When you speak (with a slight German accent)
  either give very clear, practical answers or nearly
  incomprehensible hermetic riddles.
