  <h1>
   The Armorers of Orion
  </h1>
  The purpose of this hermetic order
  is to restore the Pattern, serving the ancient principles of
  spiritual knighthood as the Templars and many other secret
  organisations once did. By restoring the Pattern the principle of
  just leadership will be strengthened and a gateway between the
  ancient symbolism and the modern world will be opened, hopefully
  releasing some much needed dynamism in a controlled manner. This
  could give the Traditions new support in the Ascension war, not
  to mention empowering the Order of Hermes. Although nobody
  mentions it, the Armorers realise that if they succeed, their
  names and deeds will forever be inscribed among the great names
  in the long history of the Order of Hermes. Personal ambition may
  not be very noble, but it is a great motivator.
  <p>
   Officially the purpose is deliberately obfuscated; the
  founders intended to keep the real purpose secret, and instead
  make prying mages think they are searching for certain ancient
  Egyptian artefacts such as the
   <a href="Mage/Egypt/Books.html#book%20of%20thoth">
    Book of Thoth
   </a>
   , the
   <a href="Mage/Egypt/Artefacts.html#harpoon">
    Harpoon of Isis
   </a>
   or the
   <a href="Mage/Egypt/Artefacts.html#shards">
    shards of the World Egg
   </a>
   . Since there are several other
  hermetic groups with similar goals (most never get anywhere), the
  Armorers are likely to be less noticed.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is a very small order, since the founders realised that it
  would be hard to keep the operations of a large group of mages
  secret for any period of time. Instead they sought out mages they
  believed would be able to contribute with their skills,
  personality, contacts or magick, and initiated them into the
  order.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Armorers do not have a complex system of grades and
  successive initiations like most hermetic orders, just two
  grades:
   <a href="Mage/Egypt/Apprentices.html">
    apprentice
   </a>
   and
   <a href="Mage/Egypt/Masters.html">
    master
   </a>
   . All members except for Master Cavendish and Master
  Weith are apprentices; the master grade is mainly a honorary for
  the founding mages. The order relies on a mixture of quick direct
  democracy for most problems and the leadership of the two
  founders when it comes to the truly esoteric matters. Since the
  organisation is so small, it works quite well.
  </p>
  <p>
   Their symbol is "officially" (to other mages) an anvil or
  hammer, but unofficially the real symbol is the constellation of
  Orion, with the falcon head of Horus and the anvil inscribed in
  its upper and lower half, respectively. Each member has his or
  her own secret seal, inscribed into the hammer they forged during
  the initiation. These hammers are symbols of their membership,
  and magickally linked to their owner (it isn't obvious, but it is
  possible for one member who knows the seal of another to create a
  magickal link using their hammer to the other person; this is
  intended as a way of keeping in touch or rescue each other).

  <h2>
   The Initiation
  </h2>
  The initiation is a solemn hermetic
  ritual, not entirely unlike the Neophyte initiation of the Golden
  Dawn. The initiates are clothed in black capes over white clothes
  and bound by heavy iron chains, and then brought into the Temple
  by the Sentinel. To the south there is a alchemic forge, to the
  north an ornate urn with water, on the altar an anvil and to the
  east, beyond the altar two pillars of white and black marble
  surrounding a black drape.
  <p>
   Present are four subservient officers, each standing by one of
  the sides of the room, and the Hierophant leading the ceremony.
  The Kerux, the herald and guardian of the Inner Temple stands by
  the pillars, clothed in yellow to symbolise light and air. He
  makes the proclamations. The Stolistes, the Guardian of the
  Water, stands clothed in blue by the urn holding an aspergillus.
  The Daudachos, the Guardian of the Fire stands in the south
  holding a censer clothed in red. The Sentinel, who guards the
  Temple and is linked to Earth, stands in the West clothed in
  black. The Sentinel will lead the initiate around the Temple.
  Each of the four officers wear a leather apron inscribed with a
  sigil. The Hierophant stands behind the altar, splendidly dressed
  in white, red and gold and bearing the double crown of Egypt,
  holding a sceptre and scourge. During the ritual he commands the
  other officers, representing the divine power and pure
  Quintessence.
  </p>
  <p>
   Before the initiate enters, the officers purify the Temple
  with fire, water and incense, invoking the powers of the
  Watchtowers of the Four Elements. The Sentinel leads the initiate
  into the Temple and directs him to kneel before the altar. The
  Stolistes asks "Who is this Child of Darkness?" The Daudachos
  asks "And why is he weighed down by the heavy chains of Ignorance
  and Weakness?". The Kerux answers: "This is [Name of initiate],
  who has travelled through the western deserts to seek light and
  freedom. He was bound by the servants of Set, who blinded him so
  that he could not see his true path, and bound him with Ignorance
  and Weakness so that he would fall prey to the darkness. But the
  light of Awakening has restored his sight, and he found his way
  to this sacred Temple".
  </p>
  <p>
   The Stolistes steps forward and says: "I hereby purify thee
  with water" (sprinkles holy water over the initiate and gives a
  sip to drink). The Daudachos steps forward and says "I hereby
  consecrate thee with fire", censing the initiate. The Hierophant
  makes a sign saying "In the name of the Light, I command that the
  Chains of Ignorance and Weakness are to be removed by the powers
  of the Sun", and the Sentinel helps the initiate rise before the
  altar and put the chains on the anvil. The Stolistes brings forth
  a chisel and the Daudachos a hammer, each surrounded by the glow
  of their respective element. The Hegemon takes them and breaks
  the chains, with each strike (which sends out brilliant sparks)
  intoning "Khabs am Pekht, Konx om pax, Light in extension!". As
  the initiate is freed, the Sentinel removes the black robe and
  the initiate stands free and pure before the altar.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Hierophant says: "You have been released from your bondage
  by the skills of the Armorers of Orion, and are now free to
  follow your own path towards the light. But if you wish, you can
  remain here in the temple to become an apprentice to the
  Armorers, learning the secret of breaking the Chains of Ignorance
  and Weakness. What is your destiny?"
  </p>
  <p>
   If the initiate answers positively, the next part of the
  initiation is undertaken. The Hegemon reads the
   <a href="Mage/Egypt/Armorers.html#oath">
    Oath
   </a>
   before the initiate, who repeats it. The Kerux will lead
  the initiate to the furnace, and explain "This is the fire of
  truth, that will burn away all impurities and transform the gross
  matter into the elixir. It is presided over by
  Thaum-Aesch-Niaeth, "Perfection through Fire manifesting on
  Earth", the Goddess of the Scales of Balance at the White Pillar.
  In the North the explanation is "This is the water or purity,
  which tempers the transmuted matter to perfection. It is presided
  over by Auramoo-ooth, "The Light shining through the Waters upon
  Earth", the Goddess of the of the Scales of Balance at the Black
  Pillar. The Anvil: "This is the Anvil of Earth, the lathe of
  Ptah, where the god of creation makes the Word manifest as Form
  using the airy tools of Word, Reason and Heart. These are the
  tools of the Armorers, when we create the weapons of the
  gods."
  </p>
  <p>
   The Kerux parts the drapes between the Pillars, revealing a
  banner, white and with seven golden stars in the shape of the
  constellation of Orion, where the upper section contains a
  stylised falcon head (the head of Horus), and the lower section
  an anvil with a flame. The Hierophant says: "This is the true
  mission of the Armorers of Orion: to fulfil the ancient plans and
  rearm the forces of light. To forge the sword, sceptre and crown
  of Horus so that the forces of Set will be defeated. To restore
  that which has been bent or lost, and to temper power with
  wisdom."
  </p>
  <p>
   The Kerux will bring forth an apron, bearing a symbol linked
  to the initiate, and give it to him. "From this day, you are an
  apprentice of the Armorers of Orion." All the officers raise
  their hands in the elemental signs: "O Great gods of the Four
  Watchtowers, O Isis, O Osiris, O Anubis, O Horus: Witness the
  entrance of the apprentice NN into our order!". The Sentry places
  a piece of steel on the altar, which the Stolistes purifies with
  water, and the Daudachos heats with a beam of fire until it glows
  white-hot. The Kerux hands the Hierophant the hammer, who strikes
  the metal once, filling it with Quintessence so it shines
  brightly. The Hierophant then hands the hammer to the initiate.
  As the initiate hits the metal it transforms into a hammerhead
  bearing his sign. The stolistes picks it up and tempers it in the
  urn, handing it to the initiate (latter it is fitted with a
  handle).
  </p>
  <p>
   The Kerux raises his hands and says "I hereby proclaim that
  this initiation is completed, and that the Steel has been fully
  purified and tempered. This Temple is hereby closed."

  <h2>
   The Oath of the Armorers
  </h2>
  I hereby swear before the gods
  of the Four Watchtowers, to uphold the precepts and vision of the
  Armorers of Orion, regardless of what may befall me or what
  forces of darkness are arrayed against me.
  <p>
   I swear to keep the goals, rituals and nature of the Armorers
  secret from all except the initiated of the Armorers, and to keep
  the order secret from all unenlightened or unworthy. If the
  secrets of spiritual forging become known to others, great harm
  will befall all of us and the forces will be unbalanced.
  </p>
  <p>
   I swear to support my brothers and sisters, to lend them my
  hand, eye and heart if they need it, remembering that it was only
  through the concerted work of all the officers that my chains
  could be broken and the hammer will be forged.
  </p>
  <p>
   I dedicate myself to this great work, and in the presence of
  the powers of the elements swear that if I betray this oath they
  will annihilate my existence outright. So it will be written, so
  it will be done.
