  <h3>
   The Divine Couple
  </h3>
  Laylah and Philippe are destined for
  each other, at least in the eyes of their respective conspiracies
  and the gods of Egypt. As the PCs first encounter Laylah, make
  them realise that she could be a valuable ally, and slowly try to
  make her become part of the group of people around the
  characters. Ideally, she and Philippe will gravitate to each
  other, possibly aided by subtle manipulations from the outside.
  <p>
   The significance of their meeting goes back to the myth of the
  hieros gamos, the sacred marriage between the ruler/god and high
  priestess/goddess that brings prosperity to the land. Compare
  this to the marriage of Isis and Osiris, Inanna and Dumuzi, Mary
  and Joseph. If the Pattern is completed and they marry, then the
  prophecies will be fulfilled and a great change will come upon
  the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the forces of chaos and destruction will likely seek
  to prevent this from occuring. Both Set and the Dogs of Shaitan
  will, if they find out about the nature of the two, try to
  prevent their union. Set fears they will give birth to an
  incarnation of Horus, and the Dogs (or rather, the forces behind
  them) prefers chaos and dissolution to a new order.
   <a name="restoration of sothis">
   </a>
  </p>
  <h3>
   The Restoration of Sothis
  </h3>
  Millennia ago, the temple of
  Sothis was desecrated on the order of corrupt priests of Re. The
  statue of the goddess was moved to Heliopolis, then Thebe, and
  eventually ended up far in the south. While Sothis was still
  worshipped, she lost some of her power. If the PCs can somehow
  re-discover the statue and return it to its proper place (or at
  least a proper temple in lower Egypt) they would gain a
  significant ally and restore some of the divine order.
  <p>
   Finding the statue is a hard task. If the characters learn
  enough in the temple, they could study old inscriptions from
  Heliopolis trying to track it down. In an obscure stele from the
  sixth dynasty it says that "... all gods pay homage to thee, Re.
  The ever shining Sothis who has moved into her father's house
  raises her rays to adore thee...", which suggests that the statue
  was indeed kept at the temple of Ra ("moving to her fathers
  house" suggests a divorce, possibly forced. There are analogies
  here to how Set imprisoned Isis after his ascension to the
  throne). A more detailed search of Heliopolitan records will
  reveal that there were a "guest temple" for visiting gods near
  the main temple. A text from the middle kingdom, early 12th
  dynasty mentions that many of the visiting gods had been returned
  to Thebes, which suggests that the statue may have been moved to
  the newly built temples of Luxor.
  </p>
  <p>
   A search in Luxor is not likely to reveal much. However,
  Thebes was looted by the Assyrians in 671 BC; it is not
  unreasonable to think that the priests hid the gods somewhere to
  keep them safe. If the characters could find a priestly grave
  from the era they might learn that "The Osiris Tjederef, son of
  Amun-Re, saved many gods to the temples above from the servants
  of Sutekh". "The Temples Above" can be found to refer to some of
  the forts built by Senusert III and the redoubts and temples
  built by the priest-kings of Amon. This suggests that the statue
  might have been hidden in one of the temples now submerged under
  Lake Nasser
  </p>
  <p>
   Finding the right temple is hard since the small temple of
  Sothis was lost during the retreat of the ex-rulers to Napata in
  current Sudan during the second assyrian invasion. It became
  hidden beneath sand and silt just like the original temple two
  millennia before. A careful scan through the surveys made of the
  valley just before the dam was built may suggest several possible
  sites. One way to find out is to go out there in boat, dive into
  the murky and deep waters and try to use some coincidental magick
  to find a connection to the goddess. Another possibility might be
  to try to get the knowledge from the gods themselves, or make
  deals with the Watchers. Digging her up from several meters of
  silt and her ruined temple is a challenge even for skilled mages,
  but might be worth it.
  </p>
  <p>
   The statue itself does not look much to the world, a worn
  granite statue of a seated woman with a star on her headdress.
  But it is a direct link to the goddess, and if placed in a
  properly consecrated temple and given regular worship the goddess
  is likely to do her best to support her faithful.

   Complications

  These plot ideas can be introduced to flesh

  necessary, but generally useful.
  <a name="ten trials">
  </a>
  <h3>
   The Ten Trials
  </h3>
  During the chronicle, each character will
  have to face a personal trial as the cabal slowly ascends the
  Tree of Life towards the climax on top of the pyramids. These
  tests will confront their inner nature, and must be passed in
  order for them to remain pure so that the final rite can succeed.
  At each trial, one of the characters will be "ascendant", able to
  show off their powers, while another character has to face a
  trial linked to their power or character; the challenge is both
  to avoid overextending power and to overcome lack of it.
  <p>
   These are suggested trials. Ideally, they should be adjusted
  to fit not just the character but also the player, and if the
  story takes another turn they should be changed and placed in a
  suitable scene. The order may be varied, although the current
  order is magickally "correct". One interesting possibility is to
  develop each of these situations with symbols, events and
  references suitable to the sephiroth they correspond to, see any
  textbook on the cabala.
  </p>
  <div class="c1">
   <b>
    Malkuth (the kingdom)
   </b>
   : the initiation into the Order.
    Not a trial per se, but a symbolic entrance into the quest.
   <p>
    <b>
     Yesod (the foundation)
    </b>
    : the first visit to the temple
    of Sothis. While the Moon is in his right element and may be
    playing his archaeological trickery too far, Uranus (Trond)
    will become possessed by the old dead and has to face his fear
    of completely loosing control, becoming permanently possessed.
    If Trond becomes too scared of going into the past, he will not
    be able to help the Order in its quest.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Hod (splendour)
    </b>
    : research at the Museum. Mercury
    (Rebecca) is ascendant, finding a lot of useful information
    (risks becoming too engrossed). But Saturn gets into trouble
    when Mme Granboul- Ponty turns up; he has to manage to hide his
    connections and allies from the Technocracy (and possibly from
    other allies); his complicated web of connections and secrecy
    suddenly turns out to be dangerous. If he mess up things, he
    might become "tainted" socially or put under surveillance,
    hindering the quest.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Netzach (victory)
    </b>
    : During setting up a good
    operations base Alicia gets the chance to really interact with
    the sleepers in the neighbourhood and maybe help them. Can she
    help them without attracting too much attention? At the same
    time Jupiter (Constantine) encounters problems when his
    daughter who he dearly loves and really wants more contact with
    writes and wants to visit him in Egypt - she mustn't be
    involved in the secret plans, but can he resist her? And if she
    arrives, she might distract him at a point when his connections
    and money are crucial.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Tiphareth (beauty)
    </b>
    : The Sun (Phillipe) is moving
    around in society, gathering allies, friends and admirers; very
    useful for the Order but if he is not careful he might become
    too well-known to help the Plan. At the same time Mars (Jean)
    has problems with the security - somebody is apparently trying
    to kill him or his friends, can she protect them or will she
    fail again? This is also an ideal point to introduce Laylah,
    possibly as the person in greatest danger.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Geburah (severity)
    </b>
    : In a dangerous situation where
    Mars (Jean) is in her right element (and may become
    overconfident), Philippe gets into trouble when he realises one
    of his friends or allies is on the wrong side. Can he avoid
    betraying loyalty? If he betrays, the rumour may spread and his
    reputation may suffer.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Cheshed (mercy)
    </b>
    : During the construction of the
    Pattern, Jupiter (Constantine) has to organise the financing
    and organisation of the project, avoiding both becoming too
    grandiose and to underestimate the costs. But Venus (Alicia)
    will have to ensure that the project is done with conscience
    and without undue harm to others; if she fails she will feel
    the burden of the problems the project will cause among the
    sleepers.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Binah (knowledge)
    </b>
    : During the final phases of the
    project, it becomes clear that some ritual resources needed for
    crucial rites are lacking and must be obtained. Saturn
    (McPatric) can probably arrange meetings with the artisans and
    dealers able to provide them (another possibility is to involve
    the Library of Alexandria). But when the cabal gets in touch
    with them a secret of an ancient mystery is hinted; Rebecca has
    to avoid getting side-tracked by this temptation or she will
    not be able to help finish the project. See the next section
    for some suggestions for interesting mysteries.

     Chochma (wisdom)

    : During the struggle with
    Asal-Apophras-Set Trond's knowledge of old Egypt and the dead
    will become extremely valuable. But all the revelations will
    place the Moon (Brian) in a troublesome situation: what to do
    with them? Another possibility for this dilemma is to confront
    him with Maat herself - can he stand the Truth?

  If characters fails their tests, then it is necessary to
  achieve purification somehow (even if the characters doesn't know
  they have been tested). This can be done by outstanding deeds
  showing that they can overcome their inherent flaws and
  weaknesses, possibly guided by their Avatars or the gods.

  <h3>
   Ancient Mystery
  </h3>
  There are plenty of mysteries in Egypt,
  and discovering the truth behind them is an endless source of
  plot ideas. Many mages quickly get lost in searching for answer,
  forever tracking down rumours, myths, ancient riddles and
  deliberate misdirection to find the truth. This is one reason so
  little constructive has been done among many of the mages, they
  are constantly side-tracked by tantalising hints of eternal
  secrets and the possibility of learning the real story. It may be
  wise for the storyteller to use the Masters to keep the character
  on track in the chronicle.
  <p>
   Some mysteries worth studying are:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    What is the truth behind the myth of the primeval
    mound?
   </li>
   <li>
    What is the nature of the gods?

   <li>
    Where is the real Book of Thoth?
   </li>
   <li>
    How did the mummification ritual work?
   </li>
   <li>
    What was Akhenaten after, and was there somebody behind
    him?
   </li>
   <li>
    Where are magickal treasures of the Amun priests of Upper
    Egypt?

   <li>
    Who was behind Cleopatra, and what happened?
   </li>
   <li>
    What happened to the various priesthoods?
   </li>
   <li>
    Are the rumours of an ancient brotherhood of white monks
    founded in Egypt true? And are they linked to the Arcanum?
   </li>
   <li>
    What about Canopus, the ancient city to the east of
    Alexandria? It was the last city of Egypt to become Christian,
    and its ruins were demolished by British troops in WW I. What
    hid there?
   </li>
   <li>

  <h3>
   Outside Forces
  </h3>
  If the characters manage to deal with the
  mages and gods, then they might run into trouble from other
  forces.
  <p>
   The sleepers should never be overlooked. Curious street
  children may become curious and want to discover what the strange
  foreigners are up to. Completely mundane police and security
  agencies may become interested in strange behaviour, especially
  if crimes are committed. Culture shock might provide a lot of
  amusing, problematic and downright dangerous situations.
  Especially the female characters may run into problems with
  traditional arabian views, and westerners should be careful where
  they walk in certain parts of Cairo.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another mundane problem is health. Most visitors to Egypt
  quickly acquire "Cairo quickstep", the local variant of tourist
  diarrhoea. It is not very dangerous, but might make the cabal a
  bit inefficient the first days. More serious diseases are a real
  possibility, especially since mages seldom want to go to a
  technocratic hospital and have to rely on magickal or traditional
  healing. Things can get really nasty if the cabal upsets the Law
  of Maat (Procaryote is a very handy paradox spirit), and the
  Camels of Pestilence might be sent after them by Set or the Dogs
  of Shaitan.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Arcanum is interested in the same things as the
  characters, and the search for knowledge might develop into a
  race between the mages and sleeper researchers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some of the Watchers might offer aid, either because they
  think the Plan is indeed a good thing, because they want to trick
  the humans into some kind of deal or perhaps just out of
  curiosity. Maybe they will suggest magickal support in building
  the Pattern in exchange of freeing a trapped Watcher owned by
  (say) Mr. Rifaie.
   <a id="intrigue" name="intrigue">
   </a>
  </p>
  <h3>
   Intrigue
  </h3>
  Cairo is a hotbed of magickal intrigue. The
  Ascension Jihad strains the relations between several magickal
  groups, the power balance is precarious, plots have run and
  diversified for millennia and behind the scenes several powerful
  societies have far-reaching plans. Add to this the subtle (to
  westerners) play of egyptian- arabian culture, and the potential
  for intrigue is immense.
  <p>
   Basically, several groups will do their best to co-opt the
  help of the PCs to achieve their different ends. Some are fairly
  simple, others are mind-bogglingly subtle. Of course, other
  groups want to prevent this and may do their best to interfere.
  Tricks like setting up traps for bumbling characters to fall into
  (possibly so they might be "saved" by the fortuitous arrival of
  the planner), masquerading as agents of other fractions,
  double-crosses, unholy alliances with the enemy's enemy and
  double-agents abound.
  </p>
  <p>
   The thing to remember is that most of the intrigues are fairly
  subtle and low key; direct magickal offensives or meetings with
  high-level mages are rare. The Batini will likely use middle-men
  like Jamal Haroun instead of meeting directly with the
  characters, the Priestesses of Isis prefer to work in total
  secrecy (help or sabotage just appears with no explanation) and
  even the Shayks of the White Night might meet the characters at a
  café instead of in a dark alley. More can be achieved by
  courtesy, talk and dealing than with violence and brute force -
  even if there are plenty of muscle hiding behind the scenes.
   <a id="spies" name="spies">
   </a>
  </p>
  <h3>
   Spies
  </h3>
  There are spies everywhere in Cairo. The fixers,
  go-betweens and dealers keep an eye open for profits wherever
  they can find them. The Chorus tries to watch over the faithful,
  and monitor the untrustworthy. The Batini keep an eye open for
  all sorts of things, trying to keep up with what is happening
  among the shadows. The Guardians of the Dead use cats to learn
  about what happens, while the Priestesses of Isis rely on the
  whispers among women, furtive glances from behind veiled windows
  and the chatter among sparrows. The Technocracy monitor their
  surveillance cameras and radios, while the Dogs of Shaitan simply
  skulk after anybody they find interesting. And beneath reality,
  the dead and spirits are watching intently.
  <p>
   The level of spying and paranoia has to be adjusted to fit the
  chronicle; too much, and it becomes ridiculous and the cabal
  would have to fend off spies and intrigues at every turn, too
  little and they will quietly change the world fundamentally
  without any opposition. The ideal level is to keep them alert,
  cautious and at the same time bring in the mysterious opponents
  (who sent the watcher? and is he friend or foe?).
  </p>
  <p>
   Of course, unless the characters are extremely obvious most
  groups will not immediately find them, and even once they are
  known they will not necessarily merit constant surveillance. At
  first, the prime goal for most groups aware of them will be to
  learn more about them and their goals. Later, the objective will
  be to find out what they are up to, where they live and what
  alliances they make.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Armorers can protect themselves in many ways. Lying low,
  sensible precautions, a good cover story, some magickal and
  mundane security and common sense can go a long way. One major
  concern should be to find ways of getting around, working and
  hiding without anybody knowing - quite easy in a huge, sprawling
  city like Cairo but much harder if it is not one's home turf. The
  cloak-and-dagger stuff can add a very exciting dimension to the
  otherwise dry research (just how do you hide your interest in the
  mastaba of Amen-Ka from the curator you need to ask for a look
  but suspect works for somebody? And how do you make him reveal
  who that somebody is?).
  </p>
  <p>
   If different groups find out what the Order is really up to,
  they will react differently:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    The hermetics of the Luxor Club would understand the Plan,
    and support it. But they would likely try to avoid getting
    their hands dirty, while doing their best to gain as much
    recognition as possible for it. On the other hand, they are
    rather unlikely to send spies after the cabal (that would be
    very rude).
   </li>
   <li>
    The Library of Alexandria would immediately give its full
    support and try to run the show. Powerful mages would jump into
    the Plan, likely turning a small, secret project into a matter
    of prestige and archmages.
   </li>
   <li>
    The Priestesses of Isis will quickly begin to support the
    Plan, and do their best to protect the cabal from other groups.
    Add to this the presence of Philippe, and the cabal will have
    gained a powerful, secret ally. They are also the ones most
    likely to find out about the Plan, especially if the characters
    start dealing with the gods - Isis does give her priestesses
    hints from time to time.
   </li>
   <li>
    The Batini would be far too eager to help complete the
    Pattern - unless the group that discovers the secret can be
    kept quiet, the news may very well leak out, especially to the
    chorus or Technocracy. The Architects may be trusted, and are
    not very likely to send spies after the cabal, but the other
    groups are simply too curious and paranoid, even if they in
    many ways are allies with the cabal.
   </li>
   <li>
    The Darwushim, monastic choristers and Guardians of the
    Dead are rather uninterested in the whole plan, and would
    simply watch detachedly.
   </li>
   <li>
    The Dogs of Shaitan are unlikely to truly understand what
    is going on, but will do their best to bring down the Plan and
    desecrate the Pattern.
   </li>
   <li>
    The moderate choristers will not be particularly fond of
    this kind of pagan meddling and likely try to move against it,
    but the fundamentalists are likely to become extremely
    threatening and take direct action against the cabal. However,
    it is just barely possible that they could be persuaded (with
    some *very* good persuasion, requiring all the charm, wit and
    intelligence the cabal can muster) that Horus can be identified
    with the archangel Michael and that the completion of the
    Pattern could serve their vision. This would be very hard to
    do, and may require some serious compromises with the hermetic
    vision, but it is in principle doable.
   </li>
   <li>
    The Technocracy, quite naturally, would do its outermost to
    stop it. It is also the group that has the best chance to do
    so, since it has immense mundane power and could simply step in
    (through the Egyptian state) and occupy the important points,
    halt building projects and send its minions after the
    players.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <a id="death" name="death">
  </a>
  <h3>
   Death
  </h3>
  Death can strike anywhere, anytime, anyone. By
  killing off a carefully chosen NPC the ST can show the dangers
  that surround the characters, the ruthlessness of their enemies
  or suddenly twist the plots in an unexpected direction. Death
  always causes waves, especially if it is one of the Awakened
  important to the story, but the death of a loyal ally or
  inconsequential but loveable mundane can bring themes of ethics,
  grief and responsibility into the story.
  <p>
   One trick is to set up an NPC as an enemy, making the
  characters begin making moves against him or her, and then let a
  completely independent group assassinate the enemy. Suddenly a
  roadblock just disappears, and if the PCs have focused too
  single-mindedly on resisting it they might get into trouble -
  maybe they will be framed for the deed. And who did it? Could it
  be some kind of help, or a gift with strings attached? It is also
  worth remembering, that every drop of blood shed in Cairo's
  secret struggles increases the tensions further, and can act as
  the spark that ignites the jihad.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another possibility is to let death strike closer to home, to
  friends, acquaintances or innocents. How do the mages handle the
  death of their caretaker, victim of a hung spell intended for
  them? Can they accept the fact that their magick may indirectly
  have caused the death of the little old lady who dies of fright
  when a manifestation of Anubis briefly manifests? And what about
  the eventual fate of Master Cavendish?
  </p>
  <p>
   Character death is another possibility; Egypt is filled with
  plenty of dangers and enemies. However, in Egypt death may be
  just the beginning. There are mages and powers out there that can
  make quite a difference in death, so a dead character can still
  be involved in the story. The most obvious possibility is
  mummification. The full ritual will bind together the different
  parts of a person for eternity, but finding it, having it
  performed and the spiritual quests of the recipient is an
  exciting story in itself. Today the only group that might be able
  to perform it is likely the Priestesses of Isis, although it may
  be possible to combine old hermetic magick with the mummification
  procedures known by the choristers in Wadi el Natrun. If the Plan
  is highly advanced, it is possible that Isis intervenes for a
  favoured mage and sends her priestesses to save him. If this
  happens to Philippe, then the similarities to the Osiris myth get
  even stronger.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Guardians of the Dead will be watching. In Egypt death is
  a serious matter.

  <h3>
   Divine Intervention
  </h3>
  <blockquote>
   Wizards believe in gods in just the same way they believe in
    tables.
   <cite>
    Terry Pratchett
   </cite>
  </blockquote>
  Yes, acts of the gods are a definite possibility in
  this chronicle. They should be rare and subtle; the gods are
  hampered by unbelief and remoteness, but as the PCs become more
  and more involved in the divine plots their interest will awaken.
  At first, the gods will just barely notice them, but after a
  while they may take an interest if the PCs are getting somewhere.
  <p>
   The best way to use the gods is to let the make subtle
  coincidences in the characters favour (or detriment), especially
  to guide them in the right direction. The cry of a falcon might
  warn a character about to enter a Nephandi trap (Horus), a camel
  might suddenly attack the character's car when he is on his way
  to an important meeting (Set), sewer water may flood the temple
  of the Order (Nun). They should not be quite mundane, since the
  gods are after all not entirely attuned to the modern world, but
  still coincidental. They are likely to involve animals or symbols
  of the gods; Set will influence things that belong to the desert
  while Isis will use women, living creatures or the Nile. Mages
  who pay scant attention to the symbolism might miss the
  interventions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Direct, vulgar acts are unlikely, practically impossible
  outside the Umbra or certain places. But it is quite possible for
  the mages to meet the gods halfway, by consecrating a temple
  properly and paying their respects to them (even a small amount
  of worship goes a long way if you have been near-forgotten for
  millennia). In fact, the gods may become the best allies the PCs
  can find - but they are demanding.
  </p>
  <p>
   Of the gods, Set, Horus and Isis are the most likely to
  intervene. Osiris is busy with the underworld, Hermes and Maat
  too impartial and the solar deities mostly on the side of the
  chorus.

  Set is most likely to start rallying forces against
  the PCs if they get anywhere with the Plan. He will start subtly
  at first, but step up the attacks and harassment as his anger and
  desperation grows.
  <p>
   The power of Set usually manifests in the form of things
  related to the desert, like drifts of sand, thirst, wildness or
  storms. Just like Horus Set is unable to manifest truly in the
  world due to static reality, the gauntlet and the lack of
  worshippers. Instead he relies on manipulation and intrigue to
  reach his goals.
  </p>
  <p>
   Set is able to influence people and things which are attuned
  to himself, like the snakes and scorpions of the desert, wild and
  corrupted people (especially drunken red-haired foreigners) and
  all kinds of wastelands. In some regions Set can manifest
  strongly (like in the ruins of his old temples) and even give
  supernatural aid to his followers. However, in the Nile valley he
  can only act by manipulating them. Set is also likely to attempt
  to use other malevolent powers like dwellers of Tuat, djinns and
  spirit- crocodiles against his enemies.
  </p>
  <h4>
   Horus
  </h4>
  Horus is less likely to intervene unless Set
  intervenes first; the son of Osiris is a just being, and would
  not consider giving the PCs an unfair advantage unless Set had
  already started interfering. However, he is quite ready to give
  help, especially in combating the influences of Set. He will also
  attempt to give help if prayed to or worshipped formally,
  although mostly in the form of metaphysical support rather than
  practical support. If the Pattern is completed, things will
  change profoundly.
  <p>
   Horus preferably acts through his animals the falcon and
  ichneumon (an excellent way to attack the snakes of Set), people
  with authority like policemen, judges and officers, weapons and
  in general through any object linked with government and just
  power. He is strongest in the Nile valley, especially the
  delta.
  </p>
  <h4>
   Isis
  </h4>
  Isis is the goddess most likely to intervene; in
  many ways she is the goddess of meddling. She will take an
  interest as soon as she learns of the plans of the Armorers, and
  will become truly interested once Philippe makes contact with
  Laylah. She will do her best to further the Plan without taking
  the real honour away from the PCs, and she is the most likely to
  use semi-vulgar effects to get her will done. She is also quite
  fond of revealing information in dreams, both to the PCs and her
  allies the priestesses.
  <p>
   Isis has dominion over life, growth and health, making her the
  natural ruler of all growing plants, small animals, cattle and
  women. The PCs may be saved from a pursuing riot mob by a veiled
  Arabian woman, find a sparrow picking at an electronic bug in
  their rooms or be cured from disease by eating the fruits of a
  certain date palm which they saw in a dream. She might even lead
  them to the hiding place of her scorpions or harpoon.
  </p>
  <h4>
   Thoth and Maat
  </h4>
  Thoth is impartial, watching and noting
  what happens but not interfering directly in the contest between
  Set and Horus. But he is also the god of hermetic magick, and if
  called upon properly he might dispense some of his mysterious
  knowledge (most likely in the form of a riddle in a dream only
  the worthy can untangle). His wife Maat is even more impartial,
  but will intervene to set the divine balance right if it gets too
  tilted by the acts of gods and mages. She is the goddess or
  reality, paradigms - and paradox.
  <blockquote>
   Where Set is cold, calculating, and ambitious, Djewhty [Thoth]
    is the passionless watcher and chronicler of us all. It seems
    paradoxical that he should intervene on our behalf, but of all
    the gods, he is the most apt to come when (properly) called. In
    calling on him, however, one enters into something of an
    unspoken bond: for from that point on, Djewhty will record
    one's name and deeds in his great Book of Life; and one is then
    guaranteed to be subject to final judgement in that vast, dim
    hall in the Tuat that awaits us on our death. This is the price
    of evoking Djewhty to intervene in the affairs of a mortal.

  <h4>
   Sothis
  </h4>
  One possible ally is Sothis. If the PCs can manage
  to retrieve her lost statue and set up a proper temple, then they
  will become her priesthood and she will do her outmost to protect
  and help them. Her dominion is that of time-keeping and the flow
  of the Nile, something that can turn out to be crucial in certain
  situations. In the Umbra, she might be able to call upon stellar
  forces and water elementals with great power.

  <h3>
   Dreams and Omens
  </h3>
  Dreams and omens play an important part
  in Egyptian lore. As mentioned above the Gods can make use of
  them to communicating their wishes. They are also a good way for
  the storyteller to introduce foreshadowing, warnings and hints.
  If the characters are overlooking the need to find the Architects
  one of them may have a dream where he stumbles for the desert,
  desperate for food, water and rest, and then suddenly comes to a
  splendid building where he finds a Masonic order giving him help.
  <p>
   Especially Trond is vulnerable to nightmares about present,
  past and future threats. Quite often he will vocalize the desires
  of the dead from various eras, ranging from the hatred against
  the invading frenchmen over the ambitions of failed invaders to
  the desires of the land itself.

  <h3>
   The Tools of the Armorers
  </h3>
  A hermetic order is more than
  just a secret club. By binding together its members using
  initiation, they become united much more strongly and a single
  magickal force. If the armorers work together in the spirit of
  the initiation or explicitly call upon their mutual bond, then
  the storyteller should give them a bonus to their magick or work.
  <p>
   The hammers are useful story-wise. They both provide a link
  between the members, a potential talisman (maybe they will do
  aggravated damage on beings hostile to the Pattern?) and story-
  seeds. What if somebody stole one of the hammers, and when the
  Armorers managed to track it down to a dingy room in southern
  Cairo found a strange boy who claimed he stole it to get in touch
  with them - he needs their help?
  </p>
  <p>
   Another thing to think of is the Oath. Characters who break
  their oath should realise that they do wrong, and incur the Law
  of Maat. Oathbreakers must atone for their weakness, or the final
  consecration will fail.
