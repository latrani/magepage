  In Egypt, the Ascension War is being fought with
  unrelenting ferocity. The Islamic Choristers are gaining ground,
  forcing the other traditions to conform or be attacked. The
  Technocracy tries to counteract them, but has so far not
  succeeded well enough and desperately seeks international
  support. They will stop at nothing to secure their power, just as
  their enemies.
  <p>
   The assassination of Anwar Sadat in 1981 was the signal for
  the traditions to attack; while the less-than-loyal top level
  technomancers were purged the Shayks gathered their followers and
  began the struggle to overthrow western materialism and the
  current form of Egyptian government.
  </p>
  <p>
   The fundamentalists are not relying just on violence; that is
  merely a tool. Even more important is their work on practical
  help to the sleepers. They show that the islamic organisations
  provide a much more reliable service than the inefficient
  government, making them a positive alternative. Make some
  government bureaucrats make a stupid decision (not very hard,
  usually no help is required), let an imam organize a local
  solution, and reap the profits.
  </p>
  <p>
   One of the fatal mistakes made by the Technocracy was the
  Egyptian system of guaranteed work in the public sector for
  university graduates; the administration became bloated and it
  was not hard for the choristers to infiltrate the departments
  with people loyal to the true faith. This has given them a strong
  foothold in the administration, making it hard for the
  Technocracy to use their own tools without alerting the
  choristers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The fundamentalists accept the existence of other traditions
  as long as they accept Islam and do not interfere with the
  struggle. This has led to a series of conflicts with the
   <a href="Mage/Egypt/Chorus.html#monastics">
    Coptic choristers
   </a>
   , which the fundamentalists are pushing away
  more and more. The Ahl-I-Batin are regarded as too intellectual,
  and have in the past supported the Technocracy, so they have to
  either comply or be eradicated together with the technomancers.
  The other mages are regarded as no threat, just small groups who
  understand the value of lying low.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Technocracy in the West has begun to realize the threat of
  fundamentalism in general, and have begun a large-scale
  propaganda campaign to make islamic fundamentalism the new evil
  enemy to fight (the Ivory Tower is reputedly very happy about
  this, since they dislike the loss of efficient adversary icons
  for mass manipulation after the fall of the Eastern Block).
  </p>
  <p>
   Currently the battle is waged on several levels. The
  choristers seek to agitate the population against the government,
  while silencing dissident intellectuals and making attacks
  against targets of importance to the Technocracy (including
  tourism). The Technocracy does its best to track down and jail
  supporters and to secretly kill the choristers, while
  blackmailing the Ahl-I-Batin into helping them. The batini seek
  to avoid being forced by any group, usually by playing out them
  against each other, secretly helped by the
   <a href="Mage/Egypt/Priestesses.html">
    Priestesses of Isis
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The Choristers main weakness is lack of information about the
  activities of the other awakened. They have a very widespread
  network of faithful sleepers; they will learn of anything that
  goes on in the mundane world eventually, especially strange
  events or the activities of foreigners. But they don't know what
  happens among the Awakened, and this makes them vulnerable.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Ahl-i-Batin pride themselves on keeping track of what is
   <i>
    really
   </i>
   going on, at least the
   <a href="Mage/Egypt/Batini.html#scholars">
    Scholars of Light
   </a>
   and the
   <a href="Mage/Egypt/Batini.html#brethrenofpurity">
    Brethren of Purity and Balance
   </a>
   . They know a lot about what
  different groups are planning and doing through various means,
  ranging from simple deduction and observation to blackmail
  (although they tend to be so diffident about it the victims
  seldom feel blackmailed; instead they often think it is they who
  control the situation). This includes leaks among the choristers
  and technomancers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Technocracy has the advantage of being able to use
  widespread phonetapping, government agencies and other powerful
  resources, but it is a bit too heavy-handed to get good
  information. Instead it tries to pressure some known batini
  supporters into revealing it, which has made them somewhat
  dependent on possible desinformation. The Choristers have begun
  to realise this possibility, and will doubtless attempt to either
  force the batini to end the collaboration (which would hurt them)
  or give more desinformation, in addition to helping them.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Order of Hermes in Egypt is somewhat limited. The
  Alexandrian chantry has gradually concentrated itself on dealing
  only with what is happening in it's city, and the
   <a href="Mage/Egypt/Order.html#luxor%20club">
    Luxor Club
   </a>
   is too small and introverted to give much useful
  information. Instead it relies on the batini, which are in an
  excellent position to dictate terms. On the other hand, it has
  the support of Horizon, which makes it immune from most attacks
  from the Traditions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Priestesses of Isis are second only to the batini in
  knowing what is going on, and since they have infiltrators close
  to both the Technocracy, Ahl-I-Batin, Order to Hermes and Chorus,
  they have a good view of the big picture. They do not support any
  of the sides, but give them subtle help to prevent any clear-cut
  victory that would make their manipulation hard. Their goal is to
  give crucial help at the critical moment, so that their followers
  become indispensable. They are foremost fighting the
   <a href="Mage/Egypt/Nephandi.html">
    Dogs of Shaitan/Cult of Nun
   </a>
   , which is doing its best to make
  the situation worse and ideally cause total war.
