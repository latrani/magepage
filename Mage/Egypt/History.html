  <h1>
   Egyptian History in Mage
  </h1>
  Egypt was shaped by magick;
  nowhere else the barriers between the worlds, the past and
  present, the dead and living, the gods and men are so weak and
  convoluted. Through millennia the Nile valley has been shaped by
  gods and mages as well as the beliefs of sleepers.
  <h2>
   Prehistory
  </h2>
  The prehistory of Egypt is only conjectural.
  According to the technocratic archeologists, there were humans
  there 250,000 BC. The Order of Hermes instead speak of how the
  Creator (either Atum, Chnum or Ptah) and the Pure Ones created
  the world from the first mound of order in the sea of chaos, and
  then created mankind. Some mages speculate that the secret of
  creation still exists hidden somewhere in the Nile Valley, and
  eagerly seek any hints of forgotten truths.
  <p>
   Many mages believe that what made Egypt unique was the
  closeness between the inhabiants and the gods; this explains the
  sometimes confusing mixtures between different gods and myths,
  since most umbrood have a very tenuous individuality and change
  appearance and properties depending on the viewer and his
  beliefs. In Egypt, human mages interacted freely with the gods,
  blurring the line between man and god.
  </p>
  <p>
   In these mythical times, time, space and individuality were
  still undefined and liquid, a state not unlike the Australian
  concept of the Dreamtime. There was no contradiction between
  seeing the sun as the eye of Horus, a sphere of gold rolled by a
  scarab or twelve gods ruling over each hour of day - all were
  equally true. Everyone consisted of an agglomerate of souls that
  could move apart and meld together. To bring order and structure
  to the world the humans developed ritual and eventually
  magick.
  </p>
  <p>
   According to the old myths the sun god Ra ruled both gods and
  men in the beginning. But the humans rose up against the gods,
  destroying their statues and upsetting the Law of Maat. Angered,
  Ra first intended to destroy the cosmos, but relented and led the
  gods to a voluntary exile in the worlds beyond the heavens. This
  may correspond to the first severing between the worlds of spirit
  and matter, and the creation of the Gauntlet. Needless to say,
  neither the gods or the humans could survive without each other
  and soon the temples were yet again inhabited by the
  manifestations of the gods and prayers rose to the sky, but gods
  and men no longer lived in the same world.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Predynastic Egypt
  </h2>
  Predynastic Egypt is largely unknown,
  but it is known that there were several smaller kingdoms, which
  were eventually united into Upper and Lower Egypt, which in turn
  were united by Menes of the first dynasty. Mages believe this
  corresponds to the mystical battle between Set and Horus, were
  Set represents Lower Egypt and Horus the victorious Upper Egypt.
  The struggle between the two gods continued for a long time, and
  the second dynasty swore allegiance to Set rather than Horus, but
  eventually Horus became the dominant god and the worship of Set
  declined.
  <p>
   Much of Egyptian dynastic history is influenced by the complex
  politics between the various priesthoods. These mage-priests had
  significant political power, and politics, religion and magick
  was intimately interwoven. Usually the priests of one city would
  work together against the priests of other cities, but sometimes
  political marriages between their respective divinities were
  arranged. Sometimes the Pharao would be weak enough to be
  influenced by the priests, sometimes the rulers were strong
  enough to make the priests obey and support him.
  </p>
  <p>
   The priests of Hermopolis, whose chief divinity was Thoth (by
  the Greeks identified with Hermes), would latter influence the
  Order of Hermes, although the Order drew on knowledge from many
  other priesthoods too. They envisoned the creation of the
  universe as he interplay between the eight gods of the Ogdoad
  (representing unformed reality) initiated by the divine word of
  Thoth. The solar priesthoods of Heliopolis and especially the
  priests of Amun influenced the Celestial Chorus, although to a
  much lesser extent. And the priestesses of Isis would secretly
  influence Egyptian history for millennia. The other priesthoods
  would play various roles in history, but in the end they died out
  or were assimilated into later magickal/religious traditions.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Old Kingdom
  </h2>
  The Old Kingdom (2682-2181 BC) began with
  the third dynasty and represented the pinnacle of magickal power
  of Egypt. The magick of pyramid building was developed during the
  third dynasty; earlier the egyptian kings and nobility had been
  buried beneath rectangular monuments called mastaba. But the
  influential priest- and architect-mage Imhotep realized that by
  building monuments in the right way, with the correct
  consecrations, the flows of quintessence could be diverted into
  magick. He built the staircase pyramid of Netjerykhet Zozer at
  Sakkara to give his king immortality in the next world. The
  natural flow of quintessence along the Nile was led into a
  complex enchantment to provide the dead king with a worthy
  afterlife and reflect his majesty back into the world. It seems
  that Imhotep had found the secrets of redirecting ley-lines with
  the help of architecture and using Quintessence to strengthen the
  empire by locking the paradigm in a certain shape. After the
  ascension of Imhotep, the mage was himself worshiped as the son
  of Ptah and became the patron of scribes and doctors. Mages have
  sought for his vanished temple near Sakkara for millennia to
  divine its secrets.
  <p>
   During the fourth dynasty, Egypt had become a powerful and
  unified empire. The art of pyramid building had developed, and
  through temple complex and arcades the lifegiving quintessence of
  the Nile was channeled into the afterlives of the kings. But an
  unnamed priest-mage, possibly Imhotep himself, had seen further.
  He had a vision: an immense plan to create a great hieroglyph
  across the land, invoking the great god Horus, the god of the
  kings, to protect and empower for all eternity. Each pyramid,
  housing one of the decendants and incarnations of the God would
  be a part of this pattern, a kind of huge figurine for the god to
  inhabit. When he described his great vision to king Khufu
  (Cheops), the king listened. He ordered the construction of his
  own great pyramid to act as the center for the Pattern.
  </p>
  <p>
   The successor of Khufu, Redjedef, was not as enthusiastic and
  built only a minor pyramid at Abu Roasch in the north, accepting
  but not encouraging the Great Plan. The next king, Khafre
  (Chefren) was more loyal to the priests of Horus, and built his
  own sizeable pyramid alongside Khufu.
  </p>
  <p>
   But the Plan had also set dark powers in motion. Set, the
  ancient enemy of Horus, had awakened to this new threat. If the
  pattern was completed, the warrior-god would be invincible. But
  the god of the desert silently reached out with his unseen power
  and touched the land. He made people see the waste of building
  the huge monuments and the cruelty of their masters. He
  undermined the harvests with storms and drought. And he subtly
  corrupted the priests of Ra with ambition, forcing a subtle
  conflict between the priesthoods and a greedy amassing of wealth
  in the temples, undermining the power of the kings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Khufu was warned by the mighty mage Djedi of Djed-Sneferu. The
  mage prophecied that in three generations time the chest holding
  the number of the secret apartments in the sanctuary of Thoth
  would be brought from Heliopolis to the palace by a wife of the
  priest of the sun god, who would bear three children of
  extraordinary power - which will inherit the throne of Egypt. But
  the king accepted this destiny and did not challenge it, thus
  making it real.
  </p>
  <p>
   The successor of Khafre, Menkaure (Mycerinus), could not
  afford to create a pyramid as great as his predecessors, it was
  not finished at his death and instead of granite it was covered
  with bricks. After him strife and internal struggles followed,
  until the priests of Ra finally won and put the fifth dynasty
  onto the throne. Horus was no longer the god of the pharao, and
  Ra took his place. The great plan was forgotten, and while the
  next dynasties built pyramids none were as great or sacred as the
  old, and none were part of the Plan which was forgotten. Most of
  them crumbled after a few centuries, and the once great empire
  gradually desintegrated as Set spread dissent.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The New Kingdom
  </h2>
  During the New Kingdom (1567-1085 BC)
  beginning with the eighteenth dynasty, glory returned to Egypt.
  The kingdom expanded into an empire stretching from the Euphrates
  in the east to Kush (Etiopia) in the south, its enemies were
  crushed and wealth from foreign lands accumulated along the Nile.
  The Priestesses of Isis began to assert themselves, and under
  their guidance Makare Hatshepsut (1503 BC) rose to the throne in
  the 18th dynasty. Queen Hatshepsut was a formidable woman,
  probably secretly initiated into the priesthood or even a full
  mage herself, who had helped her lethargic father Akheperkare
  Tuthmosis I rule the land even as a small girl. She married her
  easily manipulated half-brother Tuthmosis II, and ruled through
  him until he died in 1501 BC. At this point she married away her
  daughter Neferure with Tuthmosis III, the nine year old son of
  Tuthmosis II with a concubine and ruled in his place until he
  came of age. Unwilling to let go of her power she proclaimed
  herself King and Tuthmosis III as her co- regent. Their
  relationship was strained, to say the least, but she kept the
  reins of power.
  <p>
   Under her leadership Egypt prospered, although she let the
  army gather dust while she and her architect-mage Senenmut built
  a series of temples and monuments of uncertain use. It appears as
  the Priestesses of Isis were cooperating with the remaining
  architect-mages to develop a new occult pattern across Egypt,
  especially focussed in her famous temple complex in the Valley of
  Kings. This complex represents one of the major brekthroughs of
  sacred architecture, and links through a powerful ley-line to the
  nodes at Karnak. It appears likely that this temple was intended
  as a sanctuary and stronghold for the priestesses of Isis and
  Hathor (in later eras a coptic monastry was built in the
  vicinity, probably to exploit the powerful node).
  </p>
  <p>
   But the cooperation eventually turned into distrust, and other
  fractions began to support Tuthmosis III. Senenmut fell out of
  favor, and in 1482 Hatshepsut died. Her son systematically tried
  to erase her name from all monuments and inscriptions to
  obliterate her entire existence, possibly as a part of an occult
  purge against the priestesses. Little is known of the real
  conflicicts at this time, but it appears that while the kings
  grew in power and glory (the rulesrship of Amenhotep III is often
  regarded as the zenith of the new kingdom) other forces were
  upsetting the magickal balance of the Empire. The nephandic
  Servants of Nun grew in power, Set was once again worshipped and
  several magickal traditions were weakened due to vicious
  infighting.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1379 the son of Amenhotep III, Amenhotep IV, took the name
  Akhenaten and retired to his city Akhetaten (²The Horizon of
  the Aten²). He denounced the worship of Amun and the
  priesthood of Thebes, and tried to replace it with the
  monotheistic worship of Aten, the disk of the sun. This was one
  of the major junctions in the history of magick; the conflict was
  not only about political power, but also about the paradigm
  itself as the priests of Amun sought to retain the old system and
  the priests of Aten to unify all gods, all existence within Aten
  (it is uncertain how much these ideas influenced the later
  Celestial Chorus, although many chorist scholars claim it proves
  that their tradition existed in this era or were founded here by
  Mentu-hetep the blind priest-seer). The king and his priests
  isolated themselves to invoke the powers of the new unitary god,
  but at the same time other groups opposed him and the
  disturbances in the law of Maat caused instability, invasion and
  plagues. Eventually the chaos rose to crush the king, and he died
  of plague.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   ... the temples of the gods and goddesses... were in ruins.
    Their shrines were deserted and overgrown. Their sanctuaries
    were as non-existent and their courts were used as roads ...
    the gods turned their backs upon this land ... If anyone made a
    prayer to a god for advice he would never respond - and the
    same applied to a goddess. Their hearts ached inside them and
    they inflicted damage left right and centre.
   <cite>

    the temple of Karnak
   </cite>
  </blockquote>
  The priests of Amun siezed the opportunity and began
  to influence the young son of Amenhotep III, Tutankhaton (who now
  took the name Tutankhamun), using him to restore the kingdom.
  Slowly the strength of Egypt was restored, but the magickal power
  of the priesthood had been broken, possibly as a result of
  Sleepers witnessing the conflict. While the 19th dynasty rose to
  great power, the kings lacked the mystical leadership of earlier
  ages. The priesthood of Amun became a power equal to the king
  (during the 21st dynasty the priest-kings ruled Upper Egypt), but
  seems to have become corrupt and just another mundane power.
  Gradually the Empire began to decline, and foreign powers
  conquered the land - the libyans, the etiopians, the assyrians
  and the persians.
  <p>
   During the second Persian invasion in 343 BC the Cult of Nun
  took the opportunity of the unrest and vandalized the temple of
  Hermopolis and managed to steal some of the shards of the world-
  egg that were hidden in an enclosure of the temple. What happened
  to them nobody knows; it appears likely that the cultists didn't
  manage to exploit the powerful relics, but their current
  wherabouts are completely unknown.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Hellenic Era
  </h2>
  Alexander the Great freed Egypt from the
  Persian rule in 332. Many mages have tried to fathom the true
  designs of Alexander the Great. It is unknown how much he knew of
  the nature of reality (although his teacher Aristotele is
  regarded as one of the major philosopher- mages of his time), but
  it is clear that his conquests served to bring together the
  disparate traditions of the orient and occident. It is known that
  the priests of Amun pronounced him divine, which may mean that he
  was a powerful true mage (or that the corrupt priesthood simply
  tried to survive). His ability to cross huge distances safely and
  quickly, together with the widespread belief in his invincibility
  gave him an immense tactical advantage. Regardless of his true
  aims, he died like any other man during his campaign against
  India and was buried in Egypt.
  <p>
   As his empire was split between his underlings, the Prolemies
  ascended to the egyptian throne, ushering in the new era of
  magickal cross-fertilization initiated by Alexander. Ptolemy I
  Soter began the building of the Library of Alexandria, and his
  successors continued the work. Hellenic Alexandria became world
  capital of magick and philosophy, a meeting place for different
  traditions and the home for some of the most famous mages of all
  time. This was a golden age for Egypt, both magickally and
  mundanely.
  </p>
  <p>
   But Rome grew in power, and it was clear that sooner or later
  Egypt would succumb to the new political and military power of
  the mediterranean. At the same time there was a resurgence of the
  Cult of Nun, and the rulers became weaker. The Alexandrian Mob (a
  mixture between a lynch mob and a political protection racket)
  became a very real power, and even deposed some rulers; various
  groups did their best to influence it. The Ptoleies became more
  and more puppets of Rome and the Mob.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cleopatra used the situation for her bid to the throne,
  seeking to both protect her land and to achieve her personal
  goals. She was an initiate of the Priestesses of Isis, but far
  too ambitious for their taste - while they wanted to spread the
  cult across the empire, she wanted it to rule the empire. One
  fraction tried to depose her and force her into exile, but she
  began to rally an army in Syria to re- take the land from her
  brother, who was their puppet. Then Ceasar arrived, and she
  quickly made sure he became her lover and deposed her
  brother.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   "As surely as I shall yet dispence justice on the Roman
    Capital"
   <cite>
    Cleopatra
   </cite>
  </blockquote>
  Several fractions of mages used the unrest to
  further their ends, including the Cult of Nun who in 47 BC used
  the Mob to burn part of the Library of Alexandria during Caesar's
  war.
  <p>
   For a while it looked like Egypt and Rome would be united as
  equals. Cleopatra was preparing to start a new dynasty with
  Caesar, a dynasty that would rule the entire world. But in Rome
  she had fewer allies, her grandiose plans were anathema to many
  of the roman customs and ideals. A counter-conspiracy emerged,
  and Caesar was murdered to prevent the dictator from officially
  marrying the New Isis, a marriage that would have had profound
  political and magickal consequences. She had to flee back to
  Egypt, politically weakened just as the land was suffering from
  plagues and famines.
  </p>
  <p>
   She did a second attempt with Mark Antony but after his defeat
  at Actium in 31 BC the dream shattered. Cleopatra comitted
  suicide in 30 BC, and Egypt became a Roman province. The
  Priestesses and many other mages retreated to the shadows, and
  spread away from their enemies among the mystery cults of the
  empire.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Roman Era
  </h2>
  The next centuries were a relatively
  peaceful period, when Egypt acted as the granary of first the
  roman and then byzantine empire. The Library continued to act as
  the premier center of learning and philosophy. But the developing
  christian faith began to cause trouble during the second century
  AC. Alexandria became a central point in the growing church, the
  place where many influential choristers gathered to define the
  new faith. At first, many of them were allied with the library
  (the jews of the Library played a significant role in both
  translating the scriptures into latin, and in uniting greek
  philosophy with christian faith), but more and more the
  choristers began to regard the library as unnecessary and pagan.
  The Library was eventually forced underground, and the choristers
  stood triumphant. But internal schisms weakened them, and while
  the Church became stronger many chorist groups were thrown out,
  including the Coptic choristers of Egypt. As Constantinople grew
  in power, Alexandria began to decline.
  <h2>
   The Arabs
  </h2>
  In 639-642 the arabians led by Amr ibn al-As
  invaded and conquered Egypt. The Copt chorist groups in Egypt
  aided them, happy to overthrow the corrupt rulership of
  Constantinople. A secret treaty of mutual tolerance was forged
  between the coptic choristers, the moslem choristers and the
  batini which still partially holds. The different groups had
  completely different goals, and went along with them without
  disturbing each other. While the copts tended their people and
  the moslems spread the faith, the Architects of Divine Measure, a
  group of mystical architects, explored the ancient ruins and
  buildings, doing their best to learn their secrets.
  <p>
   In time the kaliphate weakened, and the administrator of
  Egypt, Ahmad Ibn Tulun, became de facto ruler of the land.
  Although he was eventually murdered, the system he instituted
  went on and Egypt remained one of the major kingdoms of the arab
  world.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Fatimids
  </h2>
  A group of the Ahl-I-Batin, the Brethren of
  Purity, desired Egypt's occult power to fulfill their esoteric
  goals. Their founder, the Persian occultist Abdallah Ibn Maymun,
  laid down a subtle plan to gain control and defeat the Kaliph in
  order to set up a more mystical society. He established himself
  in Tunisia, allied with some of the Berbers, and helped set up
  the fatimid direction of Shi'i Islam; even as he died in 875 his
  followers bided their time while the Fatimid dynasty grew in
  power. They secretly made contact with the Architects of Divine
  Measure and other groups. In 969, as they had predicted, the
  ruler of Egypt died and a series of low niles, defections and
  famines appeared; this was their signal to attack. They met
  little resistance.
  <p>
   The very night after General Gawhar had conquered the old
  capital, he founded the new capital. The reason for the speed was
  astrology: the Brethren had great plans for the new city and
  planned to use a powerful conjunction together with sacred
  architecture to make it the most powerful city in the world. The
  general placed workmen along the poles and ropes marking the
  planned walls, waiting for a bell signal at the exact moment of
  conjunction. Suddenly the bells started ringing without anybody
  giving the signal - a raven had landed on the ropes connected to
  the bells, and the diggers started digging. Instead of being
  founded at the supreme conjunction they had intended, the city
  was founded when Mars was ascendant. Since Mars in arabic is El
  Kahira, the new city was named El Kahira, "the victorious".
  </p>
  <p>
   Although the founding of the city had been a partial fiasco,
  the Architects continued their long work of re-channeling the
  quintessence of the Nile valley. They built the Al-Azar mosque
  for the Brethren, one of the most powerful nodes ever
  constructed. The coptic choristers allied with them, and for a
  time the Batini of Egypt were united and in harmony with the
  dynamic spread of Shi' i. When contact was made with the Library
  of Alexandria in 970 it seemed that even the Highest was
  supporting their plans.
  </p>
  <p>
   But gradually corruption set in, possibly due to influence
  from the Cult of Nun or opposing batini groups that exploited a
  series of incompetent or insane rulers (Kaliph al-Hakim was so
  bizarre that many mages believe he was not human). The Brethren
  finally lost their grip on power 1074 when the commander of Acre,
  Badr al- Jamali moved in to restore order, and eventually he and
  his descendants became viziers. His son al-Afdal destroyed the
  spiritual leadership of the Shi'i by choosing the younger son of
  the kaliph as successor instead of the elder son, thus making the
  spiritual succession of the movement go to Hasan-i Sabbah of
  Alamut. The purists among the Brethren followed the leadership
  into the east (where they eventually became the power behind the
  Aga Khans of India), while the more pragmatic Brethren stayed
  behind or joined up with the Library.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Ayyubids
  </h2>
  In 1169 Salah al-Din (Saladin) became ruler
  of Egypt, and formally abolished the Shi'i rulership once and for
  all. He also opened up the royal city, allowing common people to
  live and work in Kahira; Cairo began to emerge. Egypt began to
  prosper, and other groups of batini supported the spread of
  trade, science and culture. During this time the Templars came
  into contact with the batini and Library. An exchance of secrets
  occured, and some of the knowledge of the Architects came to
  europe, where it helped found the Craftsmasons.
  <p>
   The Ayyubids fought off several christian invasions, but grew
  more and more dependent on their mamluk slaves (slaves mainly
  from Turkey) as they weakened. In 1249 al-Salih Ayyub died, but
  his favorite wife Shajar al-Durr kept this secret, and ruled in
  his name. It appears likely she was yet another of the
  Priestesses of Isis who got too ambitious; although she had
  showed her competence and had the support of the mamuluks who
  proclaimed her sultan, the kaliph and the ortodox were angered by
  this and forced her to re- marry. When her attempt to re-gain
  power failed, she was arrested and was thrown under mysterious
  circumstances from the red tower of the citadel.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Mamuluks
  </h2>
  The Mamuluk era was a slow decline for
  magick in Egypt. The Mamuluk system was based on slavery. Young
  slaves were converted to Islam, educated and given a military
  training. If they managed to work their ways up the ranks they
  were eventually freed and pledged their loyalty to their former
  masters. Most high government posts were open only to the former
  slaves. To support their private armies they imported more
  slaves, creating a hotbed for intrigue, power struggles and
  violence. The batini tried to use this to regain power, but
  instead fragmented and became part of the confusing and deadly
  infighting, sometimes dragging other groups into the struggle. It
  was a slow descent into chaos, and the Cult of Nun ruled. The
  Nile shifted, the black death ravaged the land.
  <p>
   When the Ottoman empire invaded in 1517, little changed.
  During this time some of the mages had become aware of the
  changes in Europe, and decided to deliberately ignore them. They
  instituted a policy of closedness, stopped the spread of the
  printing press and planned to let the european mages fight their
  own battle; Egypt seemed safe from the Order of Reason.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The French Invasion
  </h2>
  In 1798 Napoleon invaded Egypt. The
  fragmented and weakened magickal groups were unprepared for the
  arrival of the Technocracy. The Ivory Tower had already prepared
  the way by encouraging the infighting through connections at the
  Ottoman court and by striking alliances with some batini sects.
  While the Egyptian mages managed to unite, it was too little too
  late.
  <blockquote>
   When Napoleon arrived in Cairo, he brought with him a wide
    array of disorders and also Europe.
  </blockquote>
  The Technocracy used Napoleon as a tool. They knew
  he had no real chance of holding on to Egypt and they needed him
  elsewhere, but they used him to crush all the local magickal
  groups and introduce technomancy into the Egyptian paradigm.
  <p>
   On one hand, they used the struggle between the french and the
  local resistance against them as a cover to crush the tradition
  mages they could find. They executed batini mages as
  revolutionaries, forced their way into Al-Azhar killing several
  leading choristers supporting the rebellion but also instated a
  swift and largely successful eradication program against the Cult
  of Nun.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the other hand, they did their best to demonstrate western
  ideas and technology to the Egyptians, in order to change the
  paradigm. The presence of several thousand french soldiers was a
  first step, the second step was founding Institut de l'Egypte to
  educate people. The Institut was quite successful; french
  scholars taught western industry, science, mathematics, health,
  art and literature, and they demonstrated balloon flight.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the end Napoleon was forced to leave, but the seeds planted
  by the technomancers began to grow. They had broken the back of
  the traditions, and now began the lengthy process of bringing
  Egypt into the estern world.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   The Napoleonic invasion of Egypt had profound repercussions for
    the Arab and Muslim world which continue to influence the
    region's political and social development. This was the first
    European conquest of a major Arab country in the history of
    Islam and it signalled the rapid decline of Islam as a world
    political power. Although it could be said that the Ottoman
    Empire was by this time already a spent force, the humiliation
    of Napoleon's entry into Egypt was a devastating blow to
    pan-Islamic pride. It has been said that contemporary Muslim
    fundamentalism traces its psychological origins to this initial
    shattering defeat.

  <h2>
   Modern History
  </h2>
  In the chaos after the British forced away
  Napoleon the weakened and splintered traditions were unable to
  resist the emergence of a local technocracy. Muhammed Ali rose to
  power with the support of the Technocracy, crushed the remaining
  Mamuluk resistance and began the modernization of Egypt.
  <p>
   As Egypt opened up to the West, there was a rush between the
  european Order of Hermes and the Technocracy for the magickal
  treasures of ancient Egypt. Explorers and archeologists (many
  little more than grave robbers) hurried to find talismans, nodes
  and papyri to ensure that they did not disturb the paradigm or to
  put them in safety. The remaining Egyptian mages had a hard time
  resisting the invasion, and were forced to work together with the
  western traditionalists despite the plundering.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Suez channel was a masterstroke of the Syndicate; not only
  did it sever Africa from Eurasia, disrupting magick across the
  entire continent and making it easier to colonize, it bankrupted
  the khedive Ismail and put Egypt in European debt, and it greatly
  simplified trade.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unfortunately the local Technocracy was relatively weak and
  dependent on the support of the whole Union. After the failure of
  the khedives Britain occupied Egypt in 1882, corresponding to an
  external coordinator taking control over the egyptian
  Technocracy. This continued the westernization process, and the
  technomancers worked hard at remaking egyptian society so that it
  would become more standard. One unusual aspect was that they
  supported nationalism and demands of independence, a way of
  ensuring that no god-ruler would ever get the chance to rule
  unchallenged in Egypt again.

  <h2>
   Independence
  </h2>
  In 1922 Britain recognized the independence
  of Egypt, but remained the real power until after World War II.
  During this time the choristers began a slow but steady
  come-back, and gradually regained some of the power they had lost
  a century ago.
  <p>
   The Technocracy decided it was time to set up a modern
  society, and supported the coup d'etat in 1952: now they had the
  chance to re-make society and start anew, with the old washed
  away. After some serious discussion inside the Technocracy they
  settled on Gamal Abd Al-Nasser as the precident of the republic.
  His arab-socialism fit the Technocracy perfectly, and he
  implemented their policies: repressing the Muslim Brotherhood,
  social programs, building the Assuan Dam and NWO experiments in
  international politics. But Nasser and the local technomancers
  also had problems, and after the Six Day War they were forced to
  change approach, and they replaced Nasser with Sadat.

   Sadat and the new board of directors began to rule in their
  own way, becoming increasingly independent of the rest of the
  Symposium and often employing policies on their own that
  complicated the local Timetable. Eventually the higher echelons
  of the Technocracy stepped in and ended the Sadat experiment,
  replaced the coordinators and tried to put Egypt back on
  track.
