  <h1>
   Egyptian Magick
  </h1>
  Magick in Egypt is both powerful and
  weak. There are several millennia of magick beneath the land and
  the population has widely differing beliefs; in some places
  magick is so easy to perform that it is dangerous, in others only
  certain styles are acceptable and here and there there are
  veritable null pockets where nothing works due to ancient
  prohibitions or strange paradox effects. There is no general rule
  other than: magick that is done in harmony with the place works,
  magick that is in disharmony tends to get very messy (the Law of
  Maat).
  <p>
   Today the paradigm is largely modern Arabic, with some strong
  western influences in the large cities and of course along the
  tourist routes. But just a few steps away there are the villages
  of the Copts and Fellahin, where the paradigm is much gentler to
  at least hedge magick. And in the ancient sacred sites, when the
  archaeologists and tour guides are gone, the paradigm shifts back
  in time to the ancient era.

  <h2>
   The Spheres in Egyptian Magick
  </h2>
  For almost all magickal
  work ("Hekau") in the ancient Egyptian paradigm, true names were
  used. These names were all known by Thoth and Isis, who were the
  main gods of magick.
  <h3>
   Correspondence
  </h3>
  Interestingly enough, Correspondence was a
  very rare sphere among the ancient Egyptians. It was first
  discovered/created by Imhotep, who taught it to the priesthoods
  of Thoth and Ptah. In time it became the hallmark of the sacred
  architects, who in time connected with the Hellenic
  mathematicians.
  <p>
   In Egypt correspondence parallel to the Nile is much stronger
  than across.
  </p>
  <p>
   Typical foci: Astrology, measuring ropes and poles,
  geometrical diagrams
  </p>
  <p>
   Gods: Imhotep, Thoth
  </p>
  <h3>
   Entropy
  </h3>
  Never a popular sphere, but sometimes used for
  destructive magick and in its form as destiny for blessings or
  curses.
  <p>
   Typical foci: Sand, water
  </p>
  <p>
   Gods: Set, Nepthys
  </p>
  <h3>
   Forces
  </h3>
  Another relatively little used sphere. The most
  common use was to protect against the heat of the sun.
  <p>
   Foci: sunlight
  </p>
  <p>
   Gods: Sekhmet
  </p>
  <h3>
   Life
  </h3>
  The Egyptian gods and priests excelled at Life.
  Changing form, becoming animals and plants, bringing forth growth
  and healing, controlling animals and even resurrecting the dead
  was fairly well known magick.
  <p>
   Foci: Water, ointments, amulets
  </p>
  <p>
   Gods: Isis
  </p>
  <h3>
   Matter
  </h3>
  Another fairly often used sphere. There are many
  Egyptian spells for animating clay figurines or giving dead
  matter various useful abilities such as acting as wards, tools or
  sentient beings, or for controlling natural phenomena, especially
  water (dividing the sea was known long before Moses). Most
  Egyptian matter magick was on a fairly human scale; for the
  monuments plain craftsmanship was usually used instead.
  <p>
   Foci: Clay, tools, body fluids
  </p>
  <p>
   Gods: Ptah
  </p>
  <h3>
   Mind
  </h3>
  Not widely known outside the priesthood of Thoth.
  This was the magick of knowledge and secrets.
  <p>
   Foci: Writing, secret words
  </p>
  <p>
   God: Thoth
  </p>
  <h3>
   Prime
  </h3>
  The ability to name things into reality.
  Quintessence was abundant in the ancient eras and especially in
  the Nile valley; most pattern magick didn't need any Prime
  components at all, just naming a pattern was enough. However, the
  sacred architects developed Prime magick to create effects that
  would strain even the fairly flexible reality around them, and as
  the quintessence levels slowly waned their knowledge became more
  and more essential for all magick.
  <p>
   Foci: True Names, architecture, water
  </p>
  <p>
   God: Thoth, Maat
  </p>
  <h3>
   Spirit
  </h3>
  Egyptian mages traversed the spirit worlds freely,
  and regularly dealt with the lands of the dead. In many ways Life
  and Spirit were the main spheres of most Egyptian mages.
  <p>
   Foci: statuettes, prayers, mummification tools
  </p>
  <p>
   Gods: Anubis, Osiris
  </p>
  <h3>
   Time
  </h3>
  Timekeeping was vital for the Egyptians, as was
  basic divination. But time control was never developed far;
  possibly the closeness to mythical time and the stasis of the
  society made it unnecessary.
  <p>
   Foci: astrology, Nile water
  </p>
  <p>
   Gods: Khonsu, Sothis, Thoth
