  <h2>
   The Seven Scorpions of Isis
  </h2>
  The seven scorpions lie in a
  square wooden box, with name cartouches on all sides, spelling
  the names Petet, Tjetet, Matet, Mesetet, Mesetetef, Tefen and
  Befen. If the box is opened the scorpions emerge and demand to
  know who has called them and by what right; the opener must name
  each scorpion with its correct true name (the cartouches on the
  box) or they will attack him. If he succeeds in ordering the
  scorpions they will obey him, although they occasionally test him
  by asking for their names.
  <p>
   The Seven Scorpions were created by Isis to act as her
  bodyguards, and may serve anybody who knows their true names.
  Unfortunately, they have a slight quirk: they are extremely
  talkative and love to argue, debate and banter; one of the few
  ways of keeping them silent is to keep them in the box, which
  they don't like.

   Charms: Materialise (as a normal-looking scorpion),
  Poison.
  </p>
  <p>
   Their sting is a fearsome magickal poison which drains life;
  it can hurt any being, from the simplest human to the mightiest
  god. The scorpions can also gather their power into a single
  sting, making it sevenfoldly deadly. Normally each success at a
  Rage roll will give one dot of aggravated damage; however, the
  victim will not die from it unless the owner of the scorpions so
  decree, otherwise the victim merely becomes paralysed and weak
  for as long as the poison remains in the body (equivalent to the
  time it would take to heal the wounds). The poison can be healed
  using Prime 3 magick, each success cancels one dot poison.

  <h2>
   The Harpoon of Isis
  </h2>
  A plain copper harpoon, intended for
  hippopotamus hunting. It is magickal, doing aggravated damage,
  but upon the command of the caster it may return to her hand and
  the damage is undone. According to the myth Isis used it to tilt
  the outcome of a fight between Horus and Seth in the shape of
  hippopotami. She threw it at one of the contestants, but Horus
  cried to her "You hurt me, mother!". Isis quickly called to the
  harpoon "Back!", and it returned to her hand and she threw it as
  Set instead.

  <h2>
   The Shards of the World Egg
  </h2>
  Practically nothing is known
  about the shards, except that they were kept in the temple at
  Hermopolis and were stolen in the fourth century BC. It has been
  theorised that they are the original qlippoth, the forces that
  resisted creation and was defeated by it. That would make them
  tremendously powerful nephandic foci. Another theory says they
  are remnants of the Pure Ones, a part of their power. That would
  instead make them enormously powerful foci for creative magick,
  and possibly the key to reuniting the shards of the Pure Ones.
  One group of choristers have suggested that if they are ever
  joined together the world will end and everything will return to
  the One.
