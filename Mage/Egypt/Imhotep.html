   Imhotep - the Great Architect

   Imhotep began his life as a mortal, but ascended far beyond
  that state - literally. He was the vizier of king Zozer, skilled
  in magick, medicine, administration and architecture. It is said
  that he invented Egyptian architecture and irrigation in the
  first place and according to the Order of Hermes he was the first
  mage ever to learn to harness the flow of Quintessence through
  buildings and monuments. He was responsible for the creation of
  the step pyramid of Zozer at Saqquara, the first pyramid to focus
  the ley- lines into an artificial node and also the first pyramid
  of the Pattern.
  </p>
  <p>
   Instead of dying he ascended to the plane of the gods to
  continue his studies. He became worshipped as a god of wisdom,
  healing and medicine, and many made pilgrimage to his temple near
  Saqquara. Through the dynasties he grew in power and learning,
  but also grew more and more remote from the mortals as he became
  the first truly hermetic Oracle. Still, his cult continued long
  into the classic era when he for once intervened: living in
  mythic time he saw the coming time of trouble, and during a
  period of declining worship he hid away the temple with its
  treasures of wisdom and healing in the Umbra. Most likely it
  still remains there, a realm inhabited by the loyal priests of
  Imhotep. Many hermetic mages (and sleeper archaeologists) have
  sought it, but the way remains hidden although it most likely
  starts at Saqquara.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, sometime around the beginning of the common era
  Imhotep Ascended and vanished beyond the ken of mortals or gods.
  However, this does not mean he is gone. Since he actually lived
  (lives?) beyond linear time, he can appear in any time when it is
  needed for his grand schemes. While the post-Ascension Imhotep is
  transcendent, the "mere" Oracle can manifest to make his Will
  clear. Usually this occurs in the divine realms since they are
  closest to his time and plane of existence, but he has manifested
  physically very rarely.
  </p>
  <p>
   Imhotep sees the Pattern and its completion like an adult sees
  an old and loved toy that he has long since outgrown; completing
  the Pattern is just a minor step on his quest, but he likes it.
  That doesn't mean he will necessarily give Oracular help to the
  characters - from his perspective they are just candidates for
  the cabal that will complete the Pattern someday.
  </p>
  <p>
   Personality: Imhotep doesn't manifest for nothing; he has
  better things to do than chat to mortals or mere Master mages. To
  catch his attention an event needs to have profound consequences
  or involve major powers, significant even on a timescale of
  millennia. When he manifests he might observe the rules of
  politeness or remain silent and observing for a while, but then
  he will in no uncertain words reveal his Will and depart. He is
  somewhat obliged by the rules of the Egyptian Court, and will
  come if called by one of the major gods (like Thoth, Isis,
  Osiris, Horus or Ra) observing the protocol but not much else; he
  has moved beyond the sphere of gods already.
  </p>
  <p>
   Manifestation: Imhotep usually manifests as a golden eagle,
  watching events with keen intelligence and concentration. When
  agitated or forced to reveal his true powers the eagle soar into
  the air radiating a devastating brilliance surrounded by multiple
  halos of fire and power, gradually turning into a pillar of
  light.
