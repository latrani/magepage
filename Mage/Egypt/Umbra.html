  <h1>
   The Umbra of Egypt
  </h1>
  <h2>
   The Nile
  </h2>
  The Nile is the lifeblood of Egypt, both in the
  physical world and the Umbra. In the Umbra its banks are filled
  with life, and the water shimmers with Quintessence (although it
  is much weaker today than it once was, due to the Assuan Dam).
  The floods still occur in the Umbra, despite that the Dam has
  prevented them in the physical world. Beneath the surface
  crocodile and fish spirits swim, and sometimes the surface
  briefly manifests the faces of the forgotten river divinities.
  Its water is life-giving in the Umbra, and by creating channels
  and irrigation various spirits create their own tiny realms
  around it.
  <p>
   Travel along the Nile is much faster in the Umbra than in the
  real world.

  </p>
  <h2>
   The Pyramids
  </h2>
  In the Umbra, the pyramids are immense, much
  larger and better preserved than in the physical world and
  literally shining with power. Their smooth sides are covered with
  the hieroglyphs of the Book of the Dead or magickal incantations,
  and their apexes are golden. Around them stands temple complexes
  and causeways flanked by obelisks shimmering with Quintessence.
  Protective spirits guard them in the Umbra and sing the praises
  of the dead. Still, time has gnawed even here - many of the
  temples are decayed, and some of the buildings stand empty and
  silent. The pyramids still hold strong, but around them the
  desert is spreading.
  <p>
   The pyramids are artificial nodes, and use part of their
  quintessence to uphold the realms of the dead. The pyramids
  contained hidden chambers where the dead kings and servants could
  reside in splendour, and where the true occult secrets were
  hidden. Unfortunately these have partially decayed after the
  defeat of the Egyptian Land of the Dead by the hands of the Iron
  Kingdom; the Osirians choose to withdraw to their own realms,
  moving the chambers from the Umbra and physical world to the
  Shadowlands. Still, some secret passages remain interconnecting
  the Umbra, physical world and Shadowlands (see below).
  </p>
  <p>
   Entering the Pyramids in the Umbra is not simple, since they
  are all guarded. Most of the lesser pyramids have been robbed
  even of their spiritual power so that the guards are weakened,
  but the great pyramids are still strong enough to pose a
  formidable defence against curious mages and spirits. They are
  true fortresses, intended to withstand the attacks of time. On
  the other hand, by now many of their secrets have been found out,
  and intrepid mages can use them for their own purposes - to a
  small extent.
  </p>
  <p>
   Magickally the pyramids are very powerful. Magick performed at
  the apex or in the central chamber is supported by abundant
  quintessence and occult resonances with the entire pyramid (if
  the mage attunes the magick in the right way; a discordant act of
  magick is damped by the thick stones). But it should be noted
  that everything that is said and done in the pyramids will be
  noted by someone or something. Especially the Technocracy has
  taken great pains to monitor their activity - there is a whole
  amalgam at the Helwan construct that keeps an eye on quintessence
  levels and activities around the pyramids.

  </p>
  <h2>
   Entering the Underworld
  </h2>
  The guardians at the entrance are
  the first test. The best way to pass into the pyramid from the
  Umbra is to follow the Book of the Dead, which contains the
  secret passphrases and signs that must be given. Without it the
  journeying soul will most certainly get lost or be destroyed by
  malign forces. The entrances to the pyramids are blocked by
  rectangular doors of gold with inlaid lapis lazuli and a golden
  disc, guarded by two lions. The right is named Sef (yesterday),
  the left Tau (tomorrow). To gain entrance the visitor has to
  respectfully answer the question "Who is this?" from the lions.
  The answer is to recite from the 17th chapter of the Book of the
  Dead: "It is Tem, the dweller in the his disc, of (as others say)
  it is Ra, in his rising, in the Eastern Horizon of heaven. He
  saith, "I am yesterday, I know tomorrow." Yesterday is Osiris,
  and tomorrow is Ra on the day when he shall destroy the enemies
  of Neb-er-tcher, and when he shall establish as Prince and Ruler
  his son Horus."
  <p>
   Inside the halls pyramid the visitor has to find the secret
  passages into the Underworld. They are not easy to find, but
  there are some hints in the Book of the Dead if one knows where
  to look (Intelligence + Occult against 8). It is also possible to
  summon Anubis, the guide of the dead. This being is honour-bound
  to guide the summoner to the Underworld safely, although it will
  not help him pass the required challenges, just watch
  impassively.
  </p>
  <p>
   There are two ways to the other worlds from the interior of
  the pyramids. The North way, the Way of Immortality leads through
  the lands of the gods to the Heavenly Nile where the Bark of the
  Sun floats (this corresponds to a path into the High Umbral realm
  of the Egyptian Court). The South way, the Way of Tuat leads
  through the spiritual wastelands in the Shadowlands to the Hall
  of Two Truths, where the soul of the visitor is judged before
  entrance to the Underworld (the Egyptian Far Shores) is given
  after hard tests. Unfortunately this is the only way Anubis will
  show.
   <a name="beyond horizon">
   </a>
  </p>
  <h2>
   Beyond the Horizon
  </h2>
  The Way of Immortality starts when the
  traveller emerges from the northern gate of the pyramid into the
  world beyond. After a long journey straight to the north across
  the barren landscape the traveller will come upon two rectangular
  lakes filled with green water. These are the pools of the two
  Truths, whose water give immortality to those blessed by the
  gods. The right pool contains natron, and the left nitre. In the
  water the god Uacherura, the Great Green Water, resides. The
  traveller has to give the correct supplications before passing
  between the pools to the Amenti, Gate of North.
  <p>
   This great gate is placed where heaven curves down to meets
  the earth, and leads to the lands beyond heaven. After passing
  through Amenti, the traveller will stand before the gate of
  Taser, which is guarded by two guardians who will not open it
  unless the traveller says: "Give me your strength, for I am made
  even as ye". Then they will open it, and the traveller will enter
  the lands beyond heaven. Before taking more than three steps in
  these lands he must pronounce the correct adorations of the Lords
  of the Truth beyond the North Heaven, or disaster will occur.
  </p>
  <p>
   After a while the traveller will find a pool beneath Acacia
  trees, where the god Horus manifested as a cat kills a snake, the
  manifestation of Apopis. If the traveller behaves properly, he is
  then showed the way to the heavenly Nile where the Bark of the
  Sun moves with the Egyptian Court of gods and spirits. Throughout
  the journey, the visitor has to recite the proper prayers and
  invocations of the gods, or they will turn away and the visitor
  will be plunged into confusion or the Abyss.

  </blockquote>
  The Southern Way is harder, but the only way to
  reach the Underworld where the dead reside. The gate on the
  southern side of the pyramid will open into An-rut-f, the Place
  Where Nothing Grows, a huge desert the exact opposite of the lush
  gardens of the divine realms. The journey across An-rut-f is
  painful and dangerous, and without the guidance of Anubis there
  is a good chance that the spirit-jackals will devour the
  traveller or that a sandstorm will prove fatal.
  <p>
   Most of the desert is just a stony desert or badlands with no
  water and a thin, tiring air. Here and there there are rains of
  fire or stinging insects, walls of thorny bushes with bitter
  leaves, and fearsome monsters hiding in wait for unwary
  travellers. Another danger is the Lost, humans and spirits who
  have been lost in the underworld too long and have become feral
  creatures desperate after any form of salvation (see below).
  </p>
  <p>
   Eventually the tired traveller will reach the gate of
  Tchesert, the Gate of the Pillars of Shu (a great black pillar to
  the left and a great white pillar to the right), where the
  southern sky meets the ground. It is the northern gate of the
  Tuat, the entrance into the Hall of two Truths. To enter the
  Hall, the traveller has to recite a long litany from the 17th
  chapter of the Book of the Dead, where he claims his right to
  enter the Hall, affirms his will to seek the light and renounces
  all his crimes. If the litany is recited properly, Anubis will
  lead the traveller into the Hall.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the Hall, the 42 Judges of the Dead are seated in a long
  row. The traveller has to name each in turn, and deny the sin of
  which the judge presides over (the "negative confession"
  described in
   <a href="http://interoz.com/egypt/bod122.htm">
    Book
  of the Dead
   </a>
   ). If the traveller passes this test, Anubis leads
  the traveller into the antechamber of the Temple where he is
  reclothed and anointed. He then has to give the passwords to
  Anubis, and demand to be brought into the Hall of Truth to have
  his heart weighed. The dread Guardian of the Gateway will stop
  him unless he says "Because I am silent, because I am pure".
  </p>
  <p>
   Eventually the traveller will enter the Hall of Truth, to have
  his heart weighed against the Feather of Maat. If the heart is
  too impure, the feather will move down and the traveller will be
  fed to the Devourer Ammut. Otherwise Thoth will inscribe the name
  of the traveller in his papyrus, and proclaim the traveller an
   <a href="Mage/Egypt/Beings.html#osirian">
    Osirian
   </a>
   , worthy to live in the Afterlife.
  </p>
  <p>
   Many of the dead did not succeed at all the tests, forgot the
  passwords or didn't even have a copy of the Book of the Dead with
  them in the afterlife. They wander the great wasteland,
  desperately seeking a way to enter the Afterlife. A merciful
  traveller may help them pass the tests, but many have fallen prey
  to dark forces, and quite a few have become insane spectres over
  the centuries they have been denied entrance. Some are willing to
  do anything to learn the required litanies, including killing
  travellers and stealing their copies of the Book.

   The Egyptian realms have always been different from the other
  realms of the dead. Their rulers, the
   <a href="Mage/Egypt/Beings.html#osirian">
    Osirians
   </a>
   , have never sought to expand them past their
  borders, and fought off any attacks from the outside with great
  success. The osirians once worked together with the living to an
  extent never seen anywhere else, which have protected the Kingdom
  of Osiris from the ravages of Oblivion.
  </p>
  <p>
   The osirians are the supreme rulers of the Egyptian
  underworld, subservient only to Osiris himself. They are
  incredibly ancient wraiths of great power; kings, priests and
  warriors kept strong by magick and tradition. Beneath them are a
  hierarchy of lesser wraiths, organised as pharaonic society.
  Farmers farm the fertile fields, fishermen fish for spectral fish
  in the Nile and scribes record the harvests. During the first
  dynasties many servants were buried alive with the king, but
  later dynasties were content with building funeral complexes
  around the major tombs to provide each ruler with servants, who
  arrived after their deaths and took their place in the system.
  Unlike the An-rut-f and the horrors of Tuat, the Kingdom is a
  pleasant place where time is unknown. Unlike everywhere else in
  the underworld there are animals; they were mummified by the
  priests as part of the cult. But outside the fertile valley
  around the Nile stretches the deserts of Oblivion, where there is
  only death.
  </p>
  <p>
   The general attitude of the Kingdom of Osiris is quality over
  quantity; Oblivion is fought by testing all souls attempting to
  enter the Kingdom in the Halls of Truth and destroying those with
  too great taint by giving them directly to the Devourer, a
  powerful manifestation of Oblivion with the head of a crocodile,
  the forequarters of a lion, and the hindquarters of a
  hippopatamus.. The pyramids and other immortal monuments also
  provide the kingdom with stability and memoriam, and provides a
  route between the worlds.
  </p>
  <p>
   <a name="alexander">
   </a>
   Still, from time to time the great
  storms from the desert blows in, and sometimes spectral warriors
  appear to attempt to wrest control from the osirians. They are
  met with the armies of the kingdom, led by Alexander the Great
  (the brilliant young sociopath ordered that he was to be buried
  in Egypt since he realised that could ensure him an even greater
  afterlife than burial elsewhere; Stygia regrets and curses the
  loss). So far most of the kingdom have survived the attacks,
  although the destruction of the Lighthouse at Pharos in a great
  maelstrom made it impossible to reach the sea from the Kingdom.
  Today it is almost completely cut off from the rest of reality,
  and slowly the desert creeps inwards. The floods of the Nile are
  growing weaker, and the fields are not quite as fertile as
  before.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although the Kingdom is still strong, it has lost contact with
  the rest of the world (something the osirians doesn't care
  about). Stygia did not succeed in conquering it, but managed to
  influence the living slightly to weaken its links to the
  skinlands. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the mummies were sold
  as medicine to Europe based on the false assumption that since
  the mummies were destined to live for eternity, by ingesting
  parts of them a person could live longer. This made it impossible
  for many of the osirians to manifest in the skinlands, and as the
  old treasures were scattered they lost touch with them
  altogether. Islam has gradually removed the worship of the old
  gods, and the dead enter the Moslem underworld instead of the
  Kingdom of Osiris.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another unusual aspect of the Kingdom and the Tuat is the Ach
  spirits ("the powerful ones", "the shining ones"). Just as a
  wraith may become a spectre by succumbing to oblivion, a wraith
  may become an Ach spirit by transcending. Possibly the Ach are
  the remnants of a transcended being, or a kind of manifestation
  of the high umbral aspects of it. The ach-iker, the perfected
  ones, seem to be representations of powerful people who have died
  in spiritual perfection. But Ach spirits can be dangerous if the
  balance of Maat is upset, and may wander around the Tuat or
  physical world seeking to restore the order by any means. This
  makes them especially dangerous to mages suffering paradox.
