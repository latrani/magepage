  <h1>
   The Egyptian Nephandi
  </h1>
  <blockquote>
   Before the development of a structured cosmos there existed in
    darkness a limitless ocean of inert water. It was envisaged as
    the primeval being called Nu or Nun. No temples were ever built
    to honor it, but the nature of Nu is present in many cult
    sanctuaries in the form of the sacred lake which symbolizes the
    'non-existence' before creation. In fact, this vast expanse of
    lifeless water never ceased to be and after creation was
    imagined to surround the celestial firmament guarding the sun,
    moon, stars and earth as well as the boundaries of the
    underworld. There was always a fear in the Egyptian mind that
    Nu would crash through the sky and drown the earth...

  <h2>
   The Dogs of Shaitan
  </h2>
  The Dogs of Shaitan are a group of
  self-centred Nephandi who revel in their disgrace; they believe
  that through degradation comes power, from dissolution
  perfection. Unlike many other Nephandi they do not seek to
  corrupt others, they believe corruption has to come from within
  oneself (although they are not consistent in this belief).
  Instead they seek to spread entropy and chaos so that the
  conditions for physical, mental and spiritual degradation become
  as good as possible.
  <p>
   The Dogs have no fixed beliefs or plans, preferring chaotic
  action instead of making diabolical plans. Often a dog just gets
  an idea and goes out to implement it, afterwards boasting to the
  others who rush off to do the same or outdo the first one. These
  plans vary from the downright basic like vandalism or murder, to
  elaborate schemes the dogs themselves do not understand. Most of
  their mystical work is crude, directed towards furthering urban
  decay and their own degeneration. Typical acts involve the spread
  of entropic taint, being a bad example for others, rape, murder
  and desecration.
  </p>
  <p>
   Most of the dogs are men and women from the street who become
  involved with the group in some way. Some are involuntary
  recruits, kidnapped and forced to endure weeks of depravity until
  they become like their captors. Others are lured into the group
  by the promise of forbidden experiences. And some rare few are
  natural widderslainte who come because their destinies draw them
  towards the maw of degeneration.
  </p>
  <p>
   There is nothing the dogs won't do, since they seek to
  dissolve their egos in total chaos. If a dog seems to have
  inhibitions against something the others help him along,
  sometimes by forcing him, sometimes by goading him on, sometimes
  by killing and using him. Nothing is sacred, nothing is stable.
  Over the last years several have killed each other just for the
  fun of it, perhaps hoping to strengthen the dogs by weakening the
  group. The chilling thing is that it works; such apparently
  counterproductive actions enforce their nihilistic paradigm, and
  makes it more likely for others to follow suit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although it would appear that the dogs are so degenerate that
  they would be obvious to any mages in Cairo, they are actually
  very hard to find or discover. Partially this is due to their
  intimate knowledge of the city; they understand its dark side
  quite well, and blend in with people despite their deviancy. But
  they also have more mystical protection, a kind of animal cunning
  combined with well developed arcane. The ignorant Nephandi do not
  know it, but they are the latest incarnation of the Cult of Nun,
  the most ancient Nephandi group in existence.

  <h2>
   The Cult of Nun
  </h2>
  The Cult of Nun dates back to creation,
  when the forces of dark, watery chaos were temporarily driven
  back by the creator god. Since then the manifestations of chaos,
  led by the great snake Apep has tried to defeat the gods and
  destroy cosmos. The illegal priests of Nun worshipped these dark
  forces and sought to disrupt the law of Maat, order itself. From
  time to time they succeeded admirably, but they also tended to
  loose what they had gained. Several times the cult has been
  destroyed utterly, only to resurge in a new form in a new time
  (it is mentioned both in the writings of Theophrastus of Cyrene
  (100 BC) and in Ludwig Prinn's work
  <i>
   De Vermis Mysteriis
  </i>
  ,
  1542). Its goal has always been total chaos and dissolution,
  although the means have differed.
  <p>
   Through the chaos and madness that is Nun comes insights; many
  members are deeply in touc with their unconscious sides and the
  universal subconscious. From time to time the Dogs focus
  themselves on certain goals, inspired by diffuse visions and
  urges. At such times of activity the mad Nephandi can become
  extremely dangerous as they suddenly attack en masse, given deep
  insight into their enemies' plans and position from their dark
  dreams. Their attacks are unusual, since they do not seek
  tactical advantages; they prefer to spread malign corruption and
  spiritual advantages.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Twisting Tunnels
  </h2>
  Being almost totally disorganised,
  the dogs have no real chantry, but tend to congregate in places
  they feel are significant. One such place is a large, irregular
  basement beneath a decaying old block somewhere in the city. The
  walls are leaking nitrous water, which in many places covers the
  floor or fills low rooms. The flooring is loose, with unexpected
  pits and traps. There is almost no light, and some areas are in
  so bad condition that they may collapse at any moment. One of the
  previous members still hangs from the noose he hanged himself
  with a year ago. Down here the dogs celebrate their rituals,
  invoking whatever forces they can invent in whatever way they can
  come up with. A group of ten babbling lunatics are imprisoned in
  one dirty chamber not much larger than an elevator. They are kept
  barely alive so that they can scream orders to the dogs, and
  sometimes be used as entertainment.
  <p>
   From this cellar (and some other places in Cairo, especially a
  dirty alley that shifts its position from time to time) it is
  possible to enter the Waters of Nun, a realm existing outside
  time and space where watery chaos still rules. The exact way to
  enter always varies; sometimes the dogs dive into the pools of
  polluted water, sometimes they run through the dark labyrinths of
  the cellar with rising frenzy, sometimes they lock themselves
  into a lightless room until they begin to hallucinate, sometimes
  they engage in orgies lasting for days, collapsing exhausted into
  the realm. In fact, many members accidentally enter the Waters
  without planning to, and others who try to enter simply fail - it
  is impossible to enter them completely by design. Leaving is
  equally arbitrary; sometimes the Dogs return after a mere moment
  having experienced a subjective eternity inside, sometimes they
  appear days or weeks after entering, without any memories.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Waters of Nun are an indistinct, unformed place where
  order doesn't exist, nothing is stable or certain. They are dark,
  watery and filled with half heard, half imagined voices and
  visions. In this sensory deprived environment most people will
  soon begin to drift between awake and asleep, loosing track of
  time and their state of mind. The ego begins to dissolve into the
  darkness and visions, until nothing but flowing chaos remains.
  This realm is the true source of power of the Dogs. To the Dogs,
  a visit to the Waters is a rare and refreshing experience that
  fills them with new visions of how to degrade themselves to
  finally dissolve their egos in all worlds.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Enemies
  </h2>
  Their main enemies today are the Euthanatos, who
  have killed several members the last years, and the Priestesses
  of Isis. The Isis mages are an unknown factor for most of the
  dogs, but the priestesses are doing their best to find and hunt
  down the dogs. Other mages suspect that there is an entropic
  force in Cairo, but have so far not found its source. The
  choristers are mainly blaming the technocracy for the City's
  evils, while the batini are too busy scheming and the hermetics
  spend their time in research.

      Appearance: A sinewy youth around 18 years old, with strangely
  old and dark eyes. Usually he is clothed in ragged and simple
  clothes, which partially hide his scarred body. Sometimes he uses
  Life to improve his appearance, and seduces tourists he later
  robs or kills.
     </p>
     <p>
      Jibreel grew up on the streets of Cairo, staying alive in
  whatever way he could: running errands, selling things he found
  or stole, begging and hustling. When he was 10 he was caught by
  the police who gave him a severe beating for no particular
  reason. As their blows and kicks struck him, something opened
  within his mind and he realised that there was truth in
  degradation; he not only deserved his pain, he wanted it. Over
  the next few years he descended in a spiral of self-mutilation
  and vice until he found the Dogs of Shaitan, which welcomed him
  as a fellow brother.
     </p>
     <p>
      Jibreel is clever, and does not indulge in depravation
  randomly. Instead he spends much time carefully thinking over his
  life, delightfully analysing all sordid details, regrets and
  mistakes. In fact, he has made self-loathing to a paradoxical art
  in which he studies all his failures and gladly seeks them out
  again and again both consciously and unconsciously. This deepens
  his connection to Entropy and chaos, and spreads their influence
  in the city around him. He has several allies who both help and
  use him for their own purposes, some of them quite influential.
  Jibreel has betrayed several of them and look forward to their
  revenges. In fact, he secretly hopes somebody will kill him -
  that would seal the meaninglessness of his life, and spread his
  taint even farther.
