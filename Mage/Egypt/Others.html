  There are a few other mages in Egypt, mostly of
  little consequence.
  <p>
   The Dreamspeakers have never had much to do with Egypt,
  although there has been rare contacts between Egyptian priests
  and Nubian wizards in the past.
  </p>
  <p>
   Alexandria was during the 20s a haven for the Cult of Ecstasy,
  but they have moved on, leaving a dusty city behind.
  </p>
  <p>
   The etherites have a certain affinity for pyramids, grandiose
  architecture and ancient-new technology, but the reality of Egypt
  quickly tires them and they move on to other regions. The one
  exception are the explorers and archaeologists, who occasionally
  lodge at the Luxor Club.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Virtual Adepts have so far ignored Egypt utterly - it is
  simply of no interest to them. As more fibre optics is laid down
  around the Mediterranean and the cable nexus of Alexandria grows,
  they might take a more active interest. There is a small group of
  Adepts interested in working with the Library, but so far the
  contacts have been inconclusive.
  </p>
  <p>
   There are a surprising number of Orphans in Egypt, possibly
  because of the magickal nature of the land. There exists plenty
  of unusual characters in the nooks and crannies of Egyptian
  society, some Awakened, some not, many somewhere in between.
  Hedge magic is not entirely uncommon, especially lesser charms.
  The sellers of herbs and drugs in the bazaars often know some
  lore that may surprise even the true mages.
  </p>
  <p>
   It should be noted that in the paradigm of Egypt, there is no
  firm distinction between Marauders and Nephandi. Both serve
  chaos, and are hence against the Law of Maat. Fortunately
  Marauder incursions are rare.
  </p>
  <p>
   One group that should definitely not be overlooked is the
  Arcanum; the Winthrop Murray Chapter House in Cairo is a major
  crossroad for Arcanum research in the region, and its library
  competes with the Luxor Club as the premier occult library about
  Egypt. The Arcanum researchers investigate all kinds of strange
  events, and may turn into unexpected problems, foes or allies for
  mages working on the Plan.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fact, the Arcanum suspects the existence of the Plan, but
  do not realise that there are real mages working on it (or are
  they secretly guided by the Red or White Monks? Remember the
  symbolism of Red and White - Set of Lower Egypt and Horus of
  Upper Egypt).
  </p>
  <p>
   The Arcanum researchers are mainly interested in the ruins of
  the Temple of Sothis, trying to discover a clue to the underlying
  beliefs of the Egyptian priests. They also do some careful
  measurements of the distances between the pyramids, comparing
  them to the stars (recalculated for 4500 years of sidereal
  motion). Examining the sites of the missing pyramids is not
  something they will think of at first, but when they do they will
  be very surprised by the activity. The Arcanum just wants to find
  out what is going on, which makes them the most dangerous of all
  enemies.
