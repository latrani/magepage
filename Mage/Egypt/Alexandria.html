   The Hidden Library of Alexandria
  </h1>
  <blockquote>
   And concerning the number of books, the establishment of
    libraries, and the collection in the Hall of the Muses, why
    need I even speak, since they are all in men's memories?

  </blockquote>
  The Hidden Library is one of the largest hermetic
  chantries in the world, and the definitely largest in Egypt.
  Still, its influence and even contact with the sleeping world is
  minimal, and most of its activities occur inside central
  Alexandria or in the Horizon realm.
  <h2>
   The Realm
  </h2>
  The realm is completely indoors, a huge
  labyrinthine building with no outside. The whole place usually
  reminds visitors of M.C. Escher, although space isn't visibly
  warped. Instead the chantry opens up inwards: windows overlook
  stairwells and classrooms, galleries seem to promise a view of
  the outside at the end but instead overlook large halls, stairs
  seem to lead out but instead lead inwards. It is as if the
  chantry wraps itself like a labyrinth around its hidden core,
  hiding it.
  <p>
   The style is a curious mixture of Arabian and roman
  architecture: winding corridors overlooking atria walled by
  latticework, ceilings covered with enamel tiles and carried by
  marble pillars, tiny cells filled with oriental splendour or the
  austerity of the stoics. And everywhere there are bookshelves,
  niches with art, tapestries and mats of extraordinary value and
  beauty. Along the walls magickal lanterns shine brightly, leaving
  no corner in total shadow. The air is slightly dry, with a hint
  of spices, incense and parchment.
  </p>
  <p>
   <a name="room of secrets">
   </a>
   The true centre of the Library
  is the Room of Secrets. The Room contains the most powerful,
  secret or sacred books of the library, only accessible to the
  High Librarian and very rarely shown to very high-ranking mages
  with important missions. Of course, through the years dozens of
  less great-spirited mages have tried to find it and break in, but
  all attempts have failed. The security is completely magickal. To
  reach the Room, one has to walk a secret path through the
  labyrinth of the Library, at certain points using magick to
  activate certain spells. If this is not done in the right way,
  one will not find one's way into the Room; some of the spells
  also tell the current High Librarian that they have been
  activated.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Room itself is an octagonal chamber with a domed roof and
  gold and blue tiled floor, lit up by ever burning lamps. Inside
  it lies many of the greatest books the Order of Hermes have ever
  acquired, and at the centre on a pedestal lies the original
  Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistros. What other books are
  present is unknown; it has been argued that the Book of Thoth is
  hidden in here, as well as the original 22 Atu and the proscribed
  writings of Heylel. The High Librarians will not tell, and the
  visitors rarely reveal anything they have seen in this chamber.
  The pure weight of knowledge gathered here creates unusual
  effects, and the Room also serves as the main node of the
  chantry.
  </p>
  <p>
   <a name="alexander">
   </a>
   Another important node is the hidden
  tomb of Alexander the Great. It lies hidden beneath modern
  Alexandria, a mausoleum/temple for the world conqueror carved out
  of limestone and white marble. His warlike life doesn't fit in
  well with the rest of the Library, but the librarians are bound
  by an old compact made with the dying Cult of Seraphis in the
  fourth century to keep the tomb in shape, light the holy lamps
  and burn the incense. In exchange, the power and protection of
  Alexander extends to the Library, which may explain its long
  survival. Some of the mages argue that the tomb symbolises man's
  apotheosis into godhead, a secret symbol for how mundane power
  can be transmuted into spiritual ascension.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Organisation
  </h2>
  The Library is ruled by a council of eight,
  led by the High Librarian. Each councillor (sometimes called
  librarian) has a special duty in the chantry, and leads his or
  her staff of Masters. The councillors are elected for life by the
  council. They are usually chosen from the staff of the
  councillors they replace.
  <p>
   Some of the most important councillors are the councillor of
  knowledge, the councillor of upkeep and the councillor of
  diplomacy. The councillor of knowledge is responsible for the
  index, the ability to find the knowledge hidden in the myriad
  tomes. The councillor of upkeep is responsible for the magickal
  and physical upkeep and the defence of the chantry; an important
  but not well respected position. The councillor of diplomacy is
  responsible for contacts with other chantries, greeting most
  guests (low-ranking guests will have to do with his secretary,
  and VIPs are greeted by the High Librarian himself) and "foreign
  affairs" in general.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Admittance
  </h2>
  The Library is careful about who they admit to
  the chantry, fearing outside attacks and infiltration. Renowned
  mages can introduce other mages to the Council, but it is up to
  it to decide if they are allowed to visit or stay. Often they
  make quite extensive background checks or test the newcomers in
  various ways to see if they are true to the spirit of the
  Library: preserving, elaborating and serving the hidden lore of
  hermetic magick.
  <h2>
   The Books
  </h2>
  Through its history, the Library has acquired a
  myriad books, on quipu, papyri, pergament, stone tablets, maps,
  bound books or printed ones. They are stored in an apparently
  incomprehensible way in shelves along hallways, in small
  chambers, in locked chests and in cabinets. Scrolls and papyri
  lie in pigeonholes, and some rooms are devoted to a single book.
  Actually, the ordering follows the Aristotelian divisions,
  elaborated to both fit into the strange architecture of the
  Library and the importance of the works.
  <p>
   The Pinakes (Tables) are the indices of the Library, in
  themselves a large set of books and scrolls guarded by the
  librarians. While many of the books in the Library are accessible
  to all members of the chantry, some are restricted and requires
  special permission to read. A few are even secret; the librarians
  are not to reveal their existence to people to seek them, but are
  instructed to report it to the Council.
  </p>
  <p>
   Borrowing books is in theory possible, but usually the Library
  demands that they are to be studied there. To be allowed to
  borrow a book the seeker must first explain the purpose to the
  librarians, and in the case of more valuable tomes the request
  will be decided by the High Librarian and the councillors. If the
  seeker lends books of equal rarity to the Library, then the
  process is considerably smoothed. Copying books is allowed, as
  long as it is done by hand.
  </p>
  <h2>
   History
  </h2>
  The chantry is not the original Library of
  Alexandria, since there were several of them. One of them was the
  library founded by Demetrius of Phaleron around 297 BC, who also
  participated in the founding of the Museion, the temple of the
  Muses. Scholars were invited to come and observe, discuss and
  work in Alexandria for the greater glory of the Muses and Ptolemy
  I Soter (the Ptolemy rules were great supporters of the library,
  and often asked other kings to send them books and scholars). The
  Museion was located near the palace, surrounded by splendid
  gardens and centred around the Great Hall, which was surrounded
  by classrooms, a dining hall and an observatory. Another library
  was located in the temple of Seraphis nearby.
  <p>
   The first recorded Librarian was Zenodotus of Ephesus, holding
  that post from the end of Ptolemy I's reign until 245 BC. His
  successor Callimachus of Cyrene created the subject catalogue of
  the 120,000 scrolls. He was in turn followed by Apollonius of
  Rhodes and was succeeded in 235 by Eratosthenes of Cyrene, the
  Stoic geographer and mathematician, author of "tetagmenos epi
  teis megaleis bibliothekeis", the "scheme of the great
  bookshelves" and discoverer of the "Sieve", a way to calculate
  prime numbers. The last recorded librarian was Aristarchus of
  Samothrace, the astronomer, who took up the position in 180 BC.
  and was driven out during dynastic struggles between two
  Ptolemies. The library persisted long after, but the names of the
  librarians are not known.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Museion and the Serapheion had become two of the most
  important chantries for the Order of Hermes, but it also invited
  mages from the Celestial Chorus, Artificers and the various
  priesthoods. Together they explored magick and knowledge,
  creating a vision of an universe ruled by order and beauty.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unfortunately, the Library also became the focus for attacks.
  The Cult of Nun, always undermining order and being, began to
  work against the Library. During the chaos of Julius Caesar's
  Egyptian war they set fire to one of the libraries but were
  prevented from attacking the other chantries by choristers loyal
  to the Library. During the Roman era the Library flourished, but
  far-seeing mages realised that a storm was slowly brewing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fractions of the Celestial Chorus saw the Alexandria chantries
  as dangerous pagan hotbeds where free, unrestrained thought led
  the thinkers away from the simple truths of the One. The
  anti-intellectual choristers were clearly growing in strength as
  the Christian faith spread.
  </p>
  <p>
   When the mages began to realise that their days in the open
  were numbered, they began to secretly hide away the greatest
  secrets. The hidden library was created, and the books were
  gradually moved into it. During the descent of the Roman empire
  many of the greatest mages of the epoch convened at the Library
  to help it hide their greatest secrets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The event that made the Library finally go into hiding was the
  murder of Hypatia, daughter of Theon in 415 on the order of St.
  Cyril.
  </p>
  <p>
   Originally they planned to hide away the scrolls for just a
  century after being forced underground and the re-emerge, but
  later events made them remain in hiding.
  </p>
  <p>
   For several centuries the hidden library was almost entirely
  cut off from reality, while Alexandria became a small backwater
  city. It became a self- contained world preserving wisdom without
  thought of the outside. The number of mages and acolytes slowly
  dwindled, and the halls gathered dust. Year after year the
  routines repeated, the bright flame of knowledge slowly
  dwindling. Finally, in desperation the High Librarian Cnidius
  used his magick to seek contact with the outside, both hoping and
  fearing to find fellow mages. The meeting in 970 between the
  Ahl-I-Batini and the librarians was a surprise to both of them,
  but in time they both realised that the event must have been
  pre-ordained by the Highest.
  </p>
  <p>
   The synthesis between the classical treasures of the Library
  and the secretive wisdom of the Ahl-I-Batini revitalised the
  library profoundly. Several groups of batini mages joined the
  library (most notably the Brethren of Purity) and together with
  the remaining librarians began to restore it to its former glory.
  They kept it a secret, only revealing it to their most trusted
  allies. Slowly the whispers spread: the Library had been
  restored, and the ancient truths once more were in the open. The
  Solificati, the Order of Hermes and the early Order of Reason
  joined the Batini in the mission of the Library. Its effects were
  profound, and affected all the traditions as copies of ancient
  texts were made, ideas were rediscovered and dogmas questioned in
  the light of truth. It was in many ways the secret birthplace for
  the renaissance.
  </p>
  <p>
   As time went on, the Library went from a closely kept secret
  to a secret fellowship to a rumoured chantry to a well respected
  chantry. Despite the magickal decline of Egypt under the Mamuluks
  and Ottomans, the Library grew. As the Ascension War heated up,
  the Library became one of the firmest bastions of the Logomantic
  traditions, defended at all costs from other groups (including
  the former allies of the Order of Reason, who now questioned its
  truths with the Enlightenment). It became a fortress of
  knowledge, powerful, influential but never very active in the
  physical world.

  <h2>
   High Librarian Adam Loewinger
  </h2>
  Adam is the current High
  Librarian, having ascended to the post in 1978 from being
  councillor of knowledge for several decades. He was born into the
  library, the last of a long and distinguished line of hermetic
  scholars dating back to the middle ages. His own speciality is
  the history of magick in Egypt, especially during the Fatimid
  era.
  <p>
   He is an energetic old man with long white hair, a high brow
  and thin spectacles. He usually speaks softly and warmly, but can
  at a moments notice turn cold and imperious if somebody speaks
  against him. He knows the depths of his knowledge and
  responsibilities, and does not hesitate to point them out if
  needed.
