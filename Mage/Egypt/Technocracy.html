  <p>
   The Technocracy has made several disastrous mistakes, and is
  in a weakened position. If it cannot regain its dominance soon,
  it may loose the battle for Egypt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Egypt has been an important place for the Syndicate and New
  World Order for a long time, ever since they sundered and crushed
  the Ahl-I-Batini. Although the Syndicate mainly turned to other
  regions in the Arab world after the war (Alexandria was one of
  their greatest strongholds in the pre-war era), the New World
  Order sought to build a firmly technocratic state. Gradually a
  kind of division of labour appeared, as the Syndicate took care
  of most of the Arab world through oil money and the New World
  Order attempted to build ideal states in Israel and Egypt.
  Between them they played various wars (wargames with real people
  and equipment) and conflicts to keep the Middle East fragmented
  and their enemies running.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 70's, the leadership of the Egyptian Technocracy began
  to show greater independence from the rest of the Technocracy and
  began to play their own politics to the chagrin of the global
  planners in the Ivory Tower, despite the fact that the results
  were good. Exactly why they did it is uncertain, but it is not
  entirely possible to rule out that they collaborated with
  fractions of the Ahl-I-Batin and groups within the Syndicate.
  </p>
  <p>
   When Anwar Sadat was assassinated in 1981, the New World Order
  stepped in and purged the local technocratic leadership. They
  appointed an western hard-line technomancer, central coordinator
  Oliver H. Kalman, to bring Egypt into line. Coordinator Kalman
  did what he could, but soon realised that the corruption had
  spread too far - he would have to reorganise the entire local
  technocracy (and Egypt itself), which would dangerously undermine
  the stability of the Middle East and the Technocracy Plan, to be
  able to get everything to fit in the mould again. Being a
  pragmatic politician he did what he could, and then made sure he
  was transferred to one of the Orbital Collectives.
  </p>
  <p>
   The current situation is a nightmare for the local
  technomancers. The fundamentalist choristers are gaining in
  strength, there are too many secret societies around to deal
  with, technomagick is unreliable in Egypt and to make matters
  even worse, the Union demands a solution. While they do not need
  to be as subtle as they might have needed to be in the West,
  their resources still do not help much against popular mistrust
  of the government or religious revival. Heads will roll, that is
  the only thing that is sure.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Mayadan Lazughli Construct
  </h2>
  The largest Technocracy
  construct (if one excepts the huge Assuan Dam) is the Mayadan
  Lazughli Construct located in Cairo, in an anonymous building
  close to the departments of the interior, justice and finance.
  From here the local Technocracy runs the show, although there are
  several secondary constructs in the vicinity and in the new
  industrial cities outside Cairo.
  <p>
   The Mayadan construct does not have a great reputation. After
  the purge it has become known among technomancers as a demotion
  to be sent there, something that has weakened it further. Still,
  its power over Egyptian politics and policy is tremendous, and
  for technomancers willing to put up with their peers the
  potential for personal power is huge.

  <h3>
   Colonel Ibrahim al-Mahir
  </h3>
  Ibrahim is the successor of
  Kalman as the coordinator for Egypt, a position he has dreamed of
  ever since he joined the Technocracy during the formation of the
  republic as an ambitious young officer. But he has become quite
  disappointed with the reality of his power, despite his still
  burning idealism.
  <p>
   He was born in Cairo in 1932 into a poor family. He joined the
  army as soon as he could (lying about his age), egged on by his
  nationalistic grandfather and his own ambition. He saw combat in
  the war against Israel 1948, and served under general Naguib. As
  he rose through the ranks, his ambition and tactical skills
  caught the interest of the New World Order which he joined
  shortly before the coup d'etat 1952. During the following years
  he became an indispensable part of the Egyptian Technocracy,
  serving under the different leaders. In the 70's he was sent on a
  long-term diplomatic mission to the other Arab nations, possibly
  because the corrupt leadership didn't trust him entirely, which
  let him avoid the purge under Kalman. As Kalman left, he
  appointed Ibrahim as his successor as coordinator.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite being 64 years old he is physically and mentally very
  fit, thanks to rigorous training and Progenitor medicine (he was
  almost killed 1967 in an airplane crash, and was restored with a
  somewhat younger body). He is the oldest and most experienced
  active technomancer of Cairo, and fanatically loyal to two
  ideals: the Technocracy and Egypt, not necessarily in that
  order.
  </p>
  <p>
   His current main problem is the fundamentalist choristers, and
  he is doing his best to track them down and annihilate them. He
  is firmly convinced that they will destroy the Egypt he serves,
  and practically anything is allowed to get at them. He realises
  that he is not likely to receive the assistance he has requested,
  so he will bend his energies at squeezing as much efficiency as
  possible from the other functions of the Egyptian
  Technocracy.

  <h3>
   Mme Yvette E. Granboul-Ponty
  </h3>
  A graduate from the Ivory
  Tower today working with the Syndicate, Yvette is the premier
  historian of the Egyptian Technocracy. She is responsible for
  defusing ancient magick and making sure history is edited
  correctly.
  <p>
   Yvette grew up in Province, intensely interested in history
  and old politics. At the university she majored in medieval
  history and her thesis (about the spread of technology through
  the medieval monasteries) raised some eyebrows - in the Ivory
  Tower. An agent was sent out to investigate her (and if necessary
  eliminate her threat). She found a competent, intelligent young
  lady who responded well to cautious probing about Technocratic
  ideology. Eventually she was admitted to the Ivory Tower where
  she began to study Applied History, the art and science of
  rewriting history and removing unsuitable evidence.
  </p>
  <p>
   After graduating from the Ivory Tower (this time with a thesis
  about remaining spiritual practices in colonial nations) she
  became part of an amalgam consisting of Syndicate and NWO
  technomancers involved in ²cleaning up² old folklore
  and historical finds. She quickly began to appreciate the
  Syndicate methods of commercialising history, making it safe and
  banal (instead of tearing down an old stone circle, why not make
  it a tourist trap with adjoining gas station?). When the Egyptian
  Technocracy was purged, she applied for relocation there.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unlike Comptroller Redmond, Yvette
   <i>

   Egypt. Her
  main duty is to oversee an amalgam of Syndicate and NWO mages
  keeping old Egyptian magick down. Most of the time they just keep
  an eye on the digs, watching for any unexpected or unsuitable
  finds (which then turn out to be something else), defusing the
  build-up of dangerous Quintessence in some places and generally
  enforcing the paradigm. Sometimes they make raids on the
  smugglers when they suspect significant artefacts are on the
  move.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yvettes greatest tool is tourists; each tourist carries with
  him his own paradigm, and busloads of American, German, Swedish,
  Japanese and French tourists help enforce the Technocratic
  paradigm exactly where it is needed the most. By commercialising
  and turning great sights into shallow entertainment, they are
  forced to fit into the paradigm and loose their magickal power.
  One of her most radical ideas have been to arrange "spiritual
  tourist tours" for New Age people who comfortably travel along
  the Nile to visit the old temples and ruins, meditate in them and
  listen to lectures from the guides, all according to a hodgepodge
  of warm, fuzzy and harmless beliefs that would make most
  traditionalists want to scream.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yvette is a clever lady, and she knows things are not going as
  well as they should. Although being stationed in Egypt is hardly
  a brilliant achievement on one's resume, she knows her work has
  been appreciated by her higher-ups and that she has many friends
  outside Egypt that will help her if needed. So she enjoys her
  stay, living in a large and stylish departement with her lovers,
  collecting antiques and discreetly planning to have a safe escape
  if things turn nasty.

  <h2>
   Helwan Construct
  </h2>
  The construct is closely linked to the
  Helwan steelworks constructs, the premier Iteration X construct
  of Egypt. The Helwan construct also houses the special Void
  Engineer strike team for possible reality emergencies,
  theoretically a well equipped, trained and loyal team of
  technomancers ready to deal with any kind of supernatural
  manifestation. In practice they are little more than general
  trouble- shooters, more often searching for cable breaks than
  reality deviance.

  <h3>
   Comptroller Jeremy Redmond
  </h3>
  Jeremy is the Iteration X
  comptroller of Cairo, something he is deeply unhappy with. Until
  recently he was the comptroller in Unit 101011111, a subunit of
  Autoctonia where he oversaw large-scale modelling and development
  of tactical algorithms for HIT Marks and other military systems.
  Unfortunately a team of Virtual Adepts managed to infiltrate his
  computer systems, steal important information about Iteration X
  tactics and then pervert the code with a subtle virus that made
  the HIT Marks go amok in a spectacular and deadly way. Jeremy was
  simply relocalised to Egypt, a severe demotion. He is currently
  trying to find a way back to grace - any way possible, just to be
  free from this heat, sand, sunlight, smells and the makeshift
  technology he has to deal with.
  <p>
   Jeremy is a tiny, pale man who spends practically all his time
  in the underground bunkers of the Iteration X constructs in
  Helwan. He spends his time watching over all the systems and
  agents, planning and organising, but nothing works as it should.
  He can't stand the other technomancers, the unstable equipment
  and especially the remains of old magick in Egypt. He will gladly
  destroy any reality deviant he can get his hands on, especially
  if it will make him look good.

   This dam is one of the greatest feats of the technocracy. It
  is not just a technical achievement, but a mystical artefact
  giving them dominion over most of Africa. Essentially it dams up
  the quintessence of the Nile, diverting it to the Technocracy; it
  is the largest technomagickal node in the world and a resonance
  sanitation achievement the Void Engineers loves to boast about.
  Hidden in the dam is a small but very well protected construct
  devoted 100% to maintaining the node and deflecting any attack
  against it; unlike the rest of the Egyptian technocracy this is
  the elite of the elite, ready for everything. The security
  involve the most advanced Iteration X constructs and subtle NWO
  surveillance systems extending for miles around it. Nothing less
  than an army of mages would be needed to damage the dam.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the Umbra the dam is a huge steel construction, marked with
  the symbol of the Technocracy, surrounded by a nimbus of power
  and arrogance. It has very strong defences even on the spiritual
  plane and anything approaching it will be attacked.
  </p>
  <p>
   The lake upstream hid a large area, turning valleys into bays
  and submerging many old places. The move of Abu Simbel was a
  clever technocratic ploy to completely sanitise the old temple by
  cutting it apart, secretly draining every last scrap of
  quintessence, and then putting it together. They know there are
  several other hidden temples below the surface, now being
  drained/hidden by the great dam.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Suez Channel
  </h2>
  The plan to build a channel between the
  Mediterranean and Red Sea was originally proposed by French
  members of the Syndicate, to improve shipping and cut Africa
  loose from the system of ley- lines in Eurasia. The New World
  Order was not entirely happy with the plan since they realised
  the tricky political complications, but were forced by the
  Symposium to accept it. After ten year of work and thousands of
  deaths among the workers the canal was opened with a lavish
  ceremony in 1869. As predicted by the Syndicate, the pasha Ismail
  became indebted to European finance houses and was forced to sell
  his canal shares to Britain. The completion of the channel broke
  several powerful ley-lines through the Sinai and disconnected
  Africa from Eurasia, making it simpler for the Technocracy to
  gain control over the continent. The creation of the Assuan Dam
  sealed the new quintessence flow, giving them tremendous power at
  the expense of the traditions.
