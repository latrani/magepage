   The Celestial Chorus in Egypt
  </h1>
  The Celestial Chorus is
  very strong in Egypt. The main groups of choristers are the
  Coptic monasts (who are dominated by Anchorites and Septarians;
  they isolate themselves from sleeper society and in many cases
  from other traditions), the moderate Muslim choristers and the
  radical fundamentalist Muslim choristers. The Alexandrian Society
  is not very active in Egypt, except in Alexandria.

  <blockquote>
   There is no town or village in Egypt or the Thebaid that is not
    surrounded by hermitages as if by walls, and the people depend
    on their prayers as if on God Himself... Through them the world
    is kept in being.

        Egypt is the home of many monasteries, some of which are truly
  ancient chorist chantries. These orders have never been large or
  interested in the world outside, instead turning inwards towards
  the divine. Still, some of them retain ancient knowledge from the
  old eras, integrating it with their own beliefs in sometimes
  surprising ways.
       </p>
       <p>
        It began in 270, when St. Antonius retreated to the desert for
  a life in contemplation. His example gathered many followers and
  monastic communities sprang up near the Red Sea or in the
  desert.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the early Christian era choristers from Egypt were
  frequently in opposition to the Emperor in Constantinople and the
  choristers of the emerging Christian church. This resulted in
  several schisms such as the Arian and Nestorian heresies where
  different fractions of the Chorus debated the nature of the
  Avatar and its relation to the One; after the councils of Nicea
  and Chalchedon some choristers retired from the shaping of the
  Church and instead retreated to their monasteries in the desert,
  ignored by the church and eventually isolated from the chorus
  mainstream.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since then they have retained their traditions almost
  unchanged, often with significant deviations from traditional
  Christianity. Some have retained elements from the old Egyptian
  religion in their teaching, and it is reputed that one chorist
  chantry in Wadi al- Natrun still knows the complete mummification
  ritual, slightly changed to a Christian context.
       </p>
       <p>
        The monastics doesn't take part of in current struggles of the
  chorus, retreating to their own world instead of joining the
  fight. They have little to do with the Islamic choristers (in
  fact, they have closer contacts with the darwushim of the
  Ahl-I-Batini). The old treaty between the monastics, batini and
  Islamic choristers is however gradually breaking down, and sooner
  or later the monastics need to take action.

             The Islamic world is the becoming the strongest seat of the
  Chorus as the millennium draws close; there have even been
  whispers that the next Pontifex Maximus will be Muslim instead of
  Christian, and that in a not too distant future the Great Adytum
  will be moved to Teheran or Mecca. That may be an exaggeration,
  but it is not far from the truth: the chorus is rapidly becoming
  more powerful and aggressive in the region.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Muslim choristers have had much contact with the
  Ahl-I-Batin, which they have sometimes struggled, sometimes
  supported. While the chorus have concentrated on the umma
  (congregation) and its people, the batini have sought their own
  insights on the fringes of religion, sometimes overstepping its
  bounds (like the case of Al- Hallaj, who was crucified in Baghdad
  for his blasphemous and ecstatic utterances). In general they
  have been tolerant of other faiths while working towards a
  balanced society guided by the truths of the Quran.
            </p>
            <p>
             For a long time the chorus had absolutely no interest in
  politics or the material world: the only thing that mattered was
  the spiritual well-being of people. Harsh times were seen as
  merely trials sent by Allah, and it was more important to
  cultivate the proper humility and faith than to overthrow the
  often corrupt rulers. This introversion was a major reason why
  the Technocracy so easily could crush the traditions of
  Egypt.
            </p>
            <p>
             As a reaction to the spread of the Technocracy, fundamentalism
  developed: a return to the basic teaching of the Quran, rejecting
  the often contradictory interpretations made by rulers and ulama
  (religious scholars, custodians of the shariah) through the
  centuries and turning to a more pure faith. The original
  fundamentalist movement (largely initiated by Muhammad Ibn'Abd
  al-Wahhab 1703-1792) turned away completely from western thought
  and technology, but modern neofundamentalism is more pragmatic:
  the tools of the Technocracy are not impure as long as they are
  used for the good of the umma and according to the Will of
  Allah.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since the 30's, the chorus has resurged in Egypt, working
  ceaselessly to gain popular support for Islam. New mosques and
  independent preachers spring up everywhere, and gain an ever
  larger following. The widespread discontent helps the chorus
  immensely. Since many of the choristers are involved in very
  practical matters like transportation, housing, tuition,
  textbooks and providing help for the poor they have achieved a
  significant credibility.
            </p>
            <p>
             The radical fundamentalist choristers seek to attack the
  Technocracy directly in a jihad, by gaining political power to
  fight the New World Order, islamize the economy (and thus
  destroying the Syndicate power) and turn society into a true
  Islamic state. The moderate choristers who do not support this
  are at best cowards, at worst the passive helpers of the
  Technocracy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Currently the radical fundamentalists are pressuring the more
  numerous moderates to follow them into battle, and are attempting
  to force the batini to choose sides: remaining neutral is no
  option - either they accept the pure faith and join the jihad, or
  be destroyed with the Technocracy. Already the fundamentalists
  have shown their power to hurt the batini, and it is uncertain
  how long the batini will remain neutral. Once they join the fold,
  the other choristers will be hard pressed to follow, and the
  jihad will begin in earnest.

            <h3>
             The Brotherhood of the Seven Pillars
            </h3>
            This chorist group
  was formed in 1801 by the survivors of the technomantic purges of
  choristers. It draws upon the traditions of several much older
  brotherhoods, some ranging back to the pre- Fatimid era.
            <p>
             The name is based on the five pillars of Islam plus two "extra
  pillars" relevant only for mages: Purity and Protection. Mages,
  the brotherhood argues, have been chosen by Allah for a special
  duty: to help and protect the sleepers from supernatural threats
  (including fallen mages) and to purify the world from evil
  influences. While some members take these ideas as the basis for
  witch-hunting, most see them more as an order to help the
  sleepers with their lives, not to strike indiscriminately against
  the supernatural.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Brotherhood is the stronghold of the moderate choristers
  of Egypt. During the two centuries since its founding it has
  slowly helped restore Islam in Egypt, riding the wave of the
  fundamentalist movement. But recently they have more and more
  lost control to the radical choristers, centred around the Shayks
  of the White Night. They have steadily been loosing ground to the
  Shayks. One reason is that Abu Hasan is so good at diplomacy and
  persuasion; he has convinced several influential choristers to
  join him, and often makes the Brotherhood agree with him even on
  its own.
            </p>
            <p>
             Another problem is lack of leadership. Traditionally the
  brotherhood has been led by the eldest and most enlightened
  master, but most decisions were made by consensus among the
  members. But now the Brotherhood is splintered, and Jeannie
  Samir, the current leader, is too non-political to help them
  against the radicals (the fact that she is a woman has also
  helped the radicals win the support of some conservative
  members).
            </p>
            <p>
             The Brotherhood has two strengths: it is larger than the
  Shayks and has more public support (although this doesn't matter
  when it comes to magickal terrorism), and it is supported by the
  Chorus of Arabia, which still has some say over the Shayks. It
  still holds power over Al-Azhar, although the Shayks are doing
  much to turn the university through the Guardians of the Law in a
  more fundamentalist direction; should they win the effects would
  be subtle and profound: Al-Azhar is the most influential and
  prestigious university in the Islamic world. Most Moslem
  choristers at least visit the university once during their
  education and it has great influence on Islamic interpretation
  both among mages and sleepers. The Shayks would get a chance to
  spread their message unhindred.

            <h3>
             Jeannie Samir: Living Saint
            </h3>
            Jeannie Samir is the nominal
  leader of the Brotherhood of the Seven Pillars. She is a short,
  old woman of mixed egyptian-western descent. Very little is known
  about her background or personal life other than that she has
  been helping the poor as long as anybody can remember. When the
  previous imam of the Brotherhood died she was the obvious choice,
  which has proved to be problematical.
            <p>
             Jeannie is a great example as a mage and human being, but she
  is not good at dealing with intrigue. Instead she almost
  completely devotes her time to helping the poor and needy on the
  streets of Cairo, helping without even expecting gratitude. Her
  humility is so extreme that it has given her significant Arcane:
  those she helps just remember the kindly but silent helper, not
  who it was. In fact, this has started rumours among the poor that
  there is an angel in Cairo. She seldom speaks (her master once
  gave her the affectionate nickname "the little rock" - she is
  hard and silent as a small rock). The only thing that really can
  make her speak up is if she witnesses a direct injustice. Then
  she immediately steps up to the wrong-doer and tells him on no
  uncertain terms his error.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jeannie is one of the most powerful mages of Cairo, a
  veritable powerhouse of faith and energy. But she has turned it
  all to nurturing and helping, and resolutely ignores politics.
  "Allah will see to it" she once remarked when asked about the
  future of the Brotherhood, and then went back to washing the
  sick. Among the secret groups of Cairo Jeannie is regarded with
  awe - nobody would dare touch her. The fundamentalists admire
  her, the Priestesses of Isis regard her as a living embodiment of
  an aspect of their goddess (which is ironic since Jeannie would
  gently but firmly point out that there is only one god) and she
  is a noticeable counteracting influence to the entropy spread by
  the Dogs of Shaitan in the slum.

            The Shayks are a tightly knit, very dynamic cabal of
  fundamentalist choristers. The leading Shayks are all devoted
  choristers, sworn to fight for the faith against all its enemies.
  Some of them are secret members, not revealing their affiliation
  to the moderate groups they belong to, but most are very open and
  vocal about their views. Around them is a group of fanatic
  awakened or acolyte followers led by Mohammad al-Tahawi, ready to
  do their part in cleansing Egypt from the technocracy, and a
  circle of sleeper scholars, imams and lawyers sharing their
  fundamentalist sentiments.
            <p>
             The Shayks have been secretly stockpiling resources such as
  weapons, allies and information in preparation for the true
  jihad. At present they merely prepare the way for it by forcing
  the other Moslem mages join their crusade and building up the
  faith and tensions needed to bring the sleepers to open revolt
  against the technocracy. They are not yet ready to strike, but
  once they have enough power on their side they will.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since they are constantly on the run from the Technocracy they
  do not have any determined headquarters, but meet up at the homes
  of members or sympathisers, or at secret places in the desert
  during the full moon (hence the name of the group).
            </p>
            <p>
             The Shayks are practically in control of the Guardians of the
  Law, the chorist council of Al-Azhar, giving them significant
  power over the university. They also have a wide network of
  pressured batini mages and sympathisers at high levels in society
  giving them access to sensitive information. They do not need
  much contact with militant Islamic organisations like Al-Jihad or
  al-Takfir wa al-Hijra; they simply give some information and
  suggestions to the right people and await the results.

            <h3>
             Shayk Abu Hasan al-Tahawi
            </h3>
            The Shayk is the leader of the
  chorist rebellion against the Technocracy. He is not the only
  leader, but he is the most charismatic and wise mage on the
  fundamentalist side - a dangerous combination with fanaticism.
            <p>
             He grew up in Alexandria at the turn of the century, the
  second son in a poor servant family. He was a quite normal boy,
  earning extra money by running errands and helping his parents,
  but he had a disturbing tendency to notice things. All was not
  right in the city, but he could not put his finger on what was
  wrong. When his father got a minor inheritance the family went on
  al-hajj al-akbar, the Great Pilgrimage to Mecca. The journey was
  long and dangerous, for the family had not enough money to travel
  safely or in comfort, but eventually they reached the holy city.
  It was there Hasan had his epiphany. As he wandered the seven
  turns around the Kabah, on each turn he saw a different angel
  standing above the great mosque watching over him with loving
  eyes, and when he finally on the seventh turn kissed the black
  stone he felt the burning light and mercy of Allah like a
  physical shock. The black stone spoke a single word to him:
  "taqwa" (to protect and/or save).
            </p>
            <p>
             After the pilgrimage he was changed; he
             <i>
              saw
             </i>
             things, he
  felt the presence of God and the angels in the world, but also
  the horrid lack of faith many people had. He sought out teachers
  and listened to recitations of the Quran, and eventually found
  his way (guided by an angel) to the al-Azhar university where he
  met other choristers, a group called the Guardians of the Law.
  They recognised him as one of their own and welcomed him.
            </p>
            <p>
             Through the years, Hasan has became known as a level-headed
  and clear-sighted man, but foremost as a uswah hasanah, a true
  example for other Muslims. He lives his life fully according to
  the Quran and upholds the five pillars of faith without wavering.
  As the leader of the Guardians of the Law, he has gained
  tremendous power over the ulama and their interpretation of the
  shariah, which he uses to guide them towards truth and to strike
  against the Technocracy. He also formed a group of leading
  choristers known as The Shayks of the White Night, which is the
  core of the fundamentalist movement in Egypt.
            </p>
            <p>
             Perhaps surprisingly the Shayk does not regard technomagick as
  inherently evil; it could become a tool for the common people to
  survive in a harsh world. But its ties to western materialism has
  to be broken and replaced with true Islam. In fact, secretly the
  Shayk realises that in order to take control completely he will
  have to use the technocratic infrastructure and some of its
  methods to restore things to the true faith. The question is not
  whether this is desirable or not, but how to avoid becoming
  corrupted by the power. That is one reason he does not trust his
  son completely, young Muhammad is filled with too much anger and
  ambition.
            </p>
            <p>
             Physically, the Shayk looks like an old man with a strong
  face. His gaze is hard to meet, it is filled with power, faith
  and love to an unbearable degree, revealing his mastery of Prime
  and Spirit. Most mages who do not know him expects a stern
  preacher or a raving fanatic, but he is neither. He is polite,
  firm and calm, often surprising his antagonists by listening
  attentively to what they have to say - and then explaining his
  view of things with great eloquence and conviction. He does not
  try to persuade people, he simply assumes everyone has the
  ability to choose between right or wrong, and within everyone
  there is a seed of truth that he can nurture. In many ways he is
  more dangerous when he listens than when he speaks.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Technocracy wants him dead. All operatives have strict
  orders to kill him at any possible opportunity - he is simply too
  dangerous. But if he would be killed, then his moderate voice in
  the Shayks of the White Night would fall silent, and the jihad
  might become much bloodier under the leadership of his son.

            Muhammad is the son of the Shayk, and very
  different. Where his father is merciful he is severe, where his
  father is a thinker, he is a doer, where his father sees jihad
  mainly as a struggle for people's hearts he sees it as a military
  fight.
            <p>
             Muhammad grew up among the choristers, and it was clear that
  he was destined to become a religious warrior almost from the
  start. He was always listening to stories about the martyrs,
  following his military uncle into the desert to learn tracking
  and shooting and generally upsetting the more peaceful choristers
  around his father. But Shayk Hasan merely smiled and blessed his
  son in his endeavour.
            </p>
            <p>
             Today Muhammad leads a small group of faithful in the
  ascension jihad. He carefully plans where to strike to maximise
  the effect and minimise the risk - he and his followers are
  fanatic, but they are not stupid. Usually they strike against
  those who should support the jihad but doesn't, like the batini,
  and things important to the Technocracy, such as tourism and
