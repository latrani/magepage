  <blockquote>
   So very difficult a matter is it to trace and find out the
    truth of anything by history.
   <cite>
    Life of Pericles,
    Plutarch.
   </cite>
  </blockquote>
  You grew up with your grandmother's histories,
  stories about old times and remote places that captured your
  imagination. You wanted to become a storyteller like her. As you
  grew older you began to realise that many other people discounted
  her stories as just tall tales and imagination; surely there was
  nothing like the lands beyond the Crooked Stump, but how come she
  knew people who had been there?
  <p>
   Several years later, you were studying history and archaeology
  with a consuming interest, having almost forgotten your childhood
  dreams of telling tall tales to people. The stories of the past
  were much more dramatic, and also
   <i>
    true.
   </i>
   At least that was
  what you thought.
  </p>
  <p>
   When the famous Dr. Jeremiah Westcroft invited you to
  participate in a dig in Syria, you jumped at the opportunity. The
  dig was everything you had hoped for, revealing the ruins of an
  old Assyrian settlement in a remote valley. But Dr. Westcroft
  seemed to be surveying other places too. One night he brought you
  with him into a narrow canyon, to a hidden rock temple. Surprised
  you asked him why he had not told everyone about this great find;
  it was clearly very significant. For an answer, he led you into
  the temple. What you saw there Awakened your Avatar and made you
  realise that not all things in the books of history are true, and
  that some things are best buried and forgotten.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since then you have been an archaeologist - or rather, a
  guardian of the old secrets. With a critical eye you have seen
  how the Technocracy streamlines history into military and
  economical chessgames, where religion and tradition are seen as
  superstition and there is no room for magick. You sabotage this
  work in a subtle way, by finding things and suggesting theories
  that sound and appear reasonable, but force history scholars to
  come to unexpected conclusions. After all, many lies (especially
  the true ones) are more plausible than the boring truth. And it
  is fun to tell stories about the past that may or may not be
  true, and only you (sometimes) know the truth about it.
  </p>
  <p>
   And on the other hand, you also hide some finds, sabotaging
  digs and quietly replace some objects with others to keep the old
  secrets safe. Neither the Technocracy or sleepers should learn
  about the grave temple of Neber- Khef and its contents; that is
  something you keep to yourself.
  </p>
  <p>
   You had already run into Master Cavendish (after all, he is on
  the board of the Seraphis Historical Foundation) and Master Weith
  (strange figure, appeared briefly on one of your digs, asked two
  questions, and vanished into the night). When you was invited
  into the Armorers you didn't hesitate - there were enough hints
  of interesting archaeology and dark truths to fascinate you.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Influence
  </h3>
  Your silver tongue has won you quite a bit of
  influence among archaeologists, and you have been a speaker on
  several conferences (ranging from the perfectly normal British
  Museum Annual Egyptological Congress to the somewhat more
  original Paradigma Historical Symposium). You are loosely tied to
  the archaeological institution at the University of Melbourne,
  but most of your research is financed by grants from various
  foundations like Seraphis Historical Foundation or the Alexandria
  Society.
  <h3>
   Roleplaying Tips
  </h3>
  You are somewhat of a storyteller, happy
  to tell other stories about other ages, sometimes grand epics,
  sometimes fun details. Most of the time they are true -
  subjectively speaking, although you often modify the truth
  slightly. You cannot stand people who don't appreciate the
  grandeur and mystery of the past, who just dwell in the present
  as if it would last forever.

  </blockquote>
  Ever since you was a small girl, you have enjoyed
  making patterns. Placing sticks in circles on the ground, drawing
  figures in the sand on the beach, drawing with your father's
  ruler and compass on the large, clean papers he brought you. Your
  mother joked that you would become a designer, but you didn't
  want to make
  <i>
   things
  </i>
  . You wanted
  <i>
   patterns
  </i>
  .
  <p>
   In school you excelled at mathematics and especially geometry.
  Your teachers and parents called you a prodigy, but you secretly
  knew that what you did was nothing special, just something
  anybody could do if they set their mind to it - which they
  didn't, for some odd reason. A professor from Cambridge heard of
  you and began spending Sunday afternoons drawing and discussing
  geometry with you. When you finally managed to finish school (a
  few years earlier than normal, but your friend the professor
  helped convince the authorities) you immediately went to
  Cambridge to learn real math.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cambridge was wonderful. At least there were people you could
   <i>
    discuss
   </i>
   with, who not just stared at your drawings or
  tried to bully you so they didn't have to face their own
  insecurity. You quickly majored in classical geometry, to the
  surprise to most of your friends who had thought you would turn
  to some of the "more current" research topics like combinatorics,
  metamathematics or at least topology. But you found them all dry
  and uninteresting - what is the point of mathematics if there are
  no
   <i>
    patterns
   </i>
   , just an arbitrary play with different
  rules?
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of your doctoral work you studied some obscure aspects
  of icosahedral symmetry and its relation to the golden mean. One
  important reference work turned out to be almost impossible to
  find, until your mentor told you about a private book collection
  at some sort of Masonic order in Cambridge. It turned out to
  consist of shelf after shelf of occult gibberish, but many of the
  books also contained renaissance or antique geometrical drawings
  which you liked, surrounded by hermetic double-talk. Studying the
  rare tome, you began to realise that your mathematical work fit
  in very well with the occult and geometrical ideas of the
  Pythagorean mystics, and somehow linked with the other books.
  Your mentor helped you study them, and gradually the pieces of
  the puzzle began to fall into place. The pattern was more
  beautiful than you had ever imagined.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since that spring, you have been a fixture in the library of
  St. Vincent Manor, always studying the secret patterns of the old
  masters. Once each year you teach a course in classical geometry
  in Cambridge for a small group of students, but the rest of the
  time you study and write, supported by a stipend from the
  Seraphis Society. Everything is in order, but recently you have
  begun to feel the need to move on, to use your knowledge and
  vision instead of just studying it.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Roleplaying tips
  </h3>
  You tend to become absorbed with the
  beauty of things, of their patterns and interrelations. When you
  have found a problem worth solving or understanding
  <i>
   nothing
  </i>
  will stop you. Often you succeed quite well in
  explaining the mystery and fascination to others, making them
  just as intrigued.
  <p>
   You cannot stand sloppiness and disorder: as above, so below,
  a messy desk is a sign of a messy mind.

  Even when you were very young you noticed the people
  who watched over you. Strangely your parents or your playmates
  didn't notice them, so you never talked about the strangers who
  sometimes gave you odd looks when they passed you in the narrow
  streets of Valetta, or the old man on the balcony who smiled
  towards you when you looked out from your window. When you fell
  into the harbour someone saved you quickly, returning you home to
  your family. You grew up knowing there were others out there who
  would protect you.
  <p>
   As you grew older, you began to spy on the watchers, sometimes
  trying to elude them, sometimes trying to find out who they were.
  You listened to your fathers stories about how lucky he was to
  have found Malta, and the strange series of events that occurred
  shortly before your birth that laid the cornerstone to his
  fortune. Imperceptibly, you began to realise what was going on,
  and just as you was on the verge of understanding, they presented
  themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
   The night of your sixteenth birthday they brought you to a
  room overlooking the sea, and told you the truth about your
  heritage, your life and your true destiny. As the sun rose from
  the waves you greeted it as a member of the Prieure de Sion, one
  of the chosen of the holy blood, destined for rulership.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since then you have been steadily rising through the ranks of
  the Prieure, to the rank of Chevalier. You heritage helps you to
  a certain extent, but there are other members of your bloodline
  who also show promise, and you know you have to work hard to
  become a perfect embodiment of the virtues the Prieure seek to
  manifest in the world. Following your mentor Nikolos' advice, you
  enrolled in the university to study some law and politics. He
  also taught you fencing and some martial art; "The holy blood is
  not to be spilt for no reason".
  </p>
  <h3>
   Background
  </h3>
  You grew up on Malta. Your mother Maria is
  Greek-Maltesian, daughter of one of the local politicians, while
  your father Arthur was an English trader who arrived on the
  island, fell in love with it and Maria, and remained. Shortly
  afterwards, he got a lucrative contract that enabled him to start
  his own business, which has since then steadily grown. He has
  been helped by what he thinks is a local fraternity of catholic
  merchants.
  <p>
   In reality, you know it is the Prieure de Sion that supports
  him (although he does quite well on his own; after all, he is of
  the Blood too, although less awakened to his potential). The
  Prieure desires three things: to protect the bloodlines that
  carry the holy blood, to help chosen men and women of the blood
  to fulfil their potential as rulers and mages, and to eventually
  place these hermetic pure-breds on the metaphysical thrones of
  Europe. Currently they are far from their goal, but though clever
  planning they are advancing on it. Influential CEOs and
  politicians have traces of the blood, and the Prieure are
  constantly trying to purify it further to bring an enlightened
  leadership to the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   Your task is currently to grow to your full potential, and
  perhaps eventually succeed your father as the leader of the major
  international transport corporation the Prieure are subtly
  creating. But as Nikolos explained, you will probably find your
  own path, guided by the secret power in your blood.
  </p>
  <p>
   When Master Weith appeared one windy day in Valetta to ask you
  if you was interested in joining his expedition to Egypt, you
  gladly accepted. You are convinced that if you can prove yourself
  in Egypt, you will be promoted to Commandeur. But there is
  something else drawing you there, something undeniable.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Roleplaying tips
  </h3>
  You have a natural dignity without being
  arrogant. You know of your own worth so well that you don't have
  to point it out to others. Unlike many hermetics you have fully
  accepted your sensual side, and like to enjoy things (in
  moderation).

  </blockquote>
  You grew up in a upper-middle class Norwegian
  family, living in a pleasant house west of Oslo near Drammen.
  Nobody can accuse your childhood and early adolescence of having
  been unusual or unhappy; it was so normal that you sometimes
  wished (or feared) something would happen. It did, and now you
  wish you would have grown up to become a boring engineer like
  your father.
  <p>
   In high school, a friend lent you a book about medieval
  demonology,
   <i>
    The Book of Black Magic
   </i>
   by Waite. You thought
  it was slightly cool to actually see a book about demons and
  sorcery, so you browsed it in the evening, reading the juicy
  parts about demons and what they could do, seals, elaborate
  ceremonies and disgusting elixirs. That night something dramatic
  happened in your dreams, which were long and chaotic while
  strangely powerful (although you cannot recall anything but
  glimpses of them when awake). Filled with dread you awoke, and
  nothing was as usual. It was as if reality itself had become
  skewed; things were no longer as they seemed, but still
   <i>
    looked
   </i>
   like they ought to even when you knew something
  different was going on. Sometimes you thought you heard voices
  saying things in unknown languages, and a few times you found
  yourself having done things you had no memory of. And weird
  coincidences began to plague your life.
  </p>
  <p>
   Trying to make sense of everything you devoured your surprised
  friend's small library of books about magic and began to study
  the area seriously. Your friends and parents worried more and
  more about you, but couldn't understand what you sought. Quickly
  you fell in with local occult groups, but most simply didn't work
  - your frightened intensity scared away the neopagans and didn't
  fit in with the dry Cabala students. You were quickly moving
  towards darker and more destructive groups when you accidentally
  (?) encountered your mentor Halvor Bergelmerson. He found you
  when you had some sort of breakdown where you suddenly began to
  shout incomprehensible chants during his lecture about Egyptian
  symbolism. Instead of throwing you out and calling the police, he
  helped calm you down and began to question you about your
  background after the shocked audience had left. He seemed more
  curious than frightened, and explained that you had chanted parts
  of the lost Book of Am-Duat, known only to a handful of
  enlightened.
  </p>
  <p>
   For a while, your life seemed to have gained at least a
  measure of order as you studied the lore of the Order of Hermes
  under Halvor. He managed to explain at least a few of your
  problems, and you learned to control your powers - somewhat. For
  even he had to admit that you worried him with your sudden
  insights in arcane topics and erratic behaviour. He guessed it
  was due to your Awakening on your own, without guidance, but his
  explanations rang hollow to you - there were something more to
  what had happened to you. After a few months you both began to
  get on the other's nerves, and you impulsively left Oslo to
  wander Europe looking for the answer, driven by your unknown (and
  possibly imaginary) demons.
  </p>
  <p>
   It was during your stay in Warsaw a message from Halvor
  reached you. He wrote that has been in contact with a hermetic
  master named Germund Weith, who was quite interested in your case
  and wanted to meet you. Asking around a bit about Master Weith
  didn't reassure you, but you felt compelled to seek him out in
  Hamburg. He turned out to be an infuriatingly clever man,
  obviously planning something and wanting to involve you in some
  way, so you quickly left. And then returned. For you knew that
  you had to be part of it.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Roleplaying tips
  </h3>
  You are frightened of the dark depths
  you know exist beneath everyday reality. The worst thing is that
  you don't have control over yourself; from time to time you
  cannot help but allowing the dark Otherness invade your mind. But
  most of the time you are completely normal, trying to make sense
  of the world.

  When you grew up, you knew you had a duty. You
  didn't know what it was, but you knew for sure you would find
  out. This rock-hard certainty set you apart from other children,
  your parents and anybody else you knew. Whatever happened, you
  knew it wasn't important compared to your goal - whatever it was.
  <p>
   It was shortly after finishing school you met Claudia. You
  stood ready to face your destiny, but for the first time you felt
  a bit uncertain about what you were supposed to do. Most of your
  friends seemed to plan to get jobs or marry, but you was certain
  that wasn't your destiny. One moonless night you simply set out
  to find it, walking briskly through the empty streets for no
  particular reason. Almost as if you were guided you found your
  way to a towering house on the outskirts of town, surrounded by a
  large dark garden.
  </p>
  <p>
   Suddenly you heard a shout, followed by what seemed like the
  sound of fighting; a woman screamed something. For a moment you
  stood frozen with fear, but then you had a brief flashback: it
  was your hesitation that had let him get past the bodyguards,
  armed with a bronze dagger. Filled with sudden energy you jumped
  over the garden wall and threw yourself against the man just as
  he fired his gun towards a woman who stood bent over his fallen
  comrade. The shot went off into the air, ricocheting against the
  gothic masonry and hitting him in the arm. He fled, leaving you,
  the woman and the fallen man who seemed to vanish into nothing as
  you watched.
  </p>
  <p>
   Claudia invited you inside, pouring you brandy as you sat
  shivering in her library. She explained about the true nature of
  the attackers, and what really had happened with the bullet. She
  also gently questioned you, almost as if she knew something about
  you and your life - and the strange flashback. She showed you
  some artefacts she had collected, and gradually your eyes opened
  to another world, a world you had always suspected but had never
  before seen. She also told you about the dark forces awake in
  that world, and about the prize of entering it, but you knew it
  was your duty to enter it.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next years were spent in training. You soon learnt that
  Claudia was hardly a commonplace person; some would say she was
  eccentric even for a hermetic mage. She had broken free from the
  established orders and houses, deciding to fight her own war
  against what she called "the three shadows" - the dark sides of
  the human psyche, the dark side of nature and the dark side of
  reality itself, manifested as Paradox. In order to fight them,
  you learned how to fight physically, mentally and spiritually.
  Even if Claudia sometimes looked and talked like an old mother,
  she could be harder than the cruellest drill sergeant, forcing
  you to hone your reflexes, perception and willpower.
  </p>
  <p>
   Several times you went on "training missions", at first a
  simple visit to a haunted building, latter more demanding and
  dangerous missions against the corruption hidden in the cities.
  There was no clear dividing line before training and the real
  fight, and you could never count on the assistance of Claudia.
  You loved it - this was the duty you had dreamed of.
  </p>
  <p>
   But after a few years you began to notice a change in Claudia.
  The library became more and more untidy, her clothes stained.
  When you returned from a dangerous journey to Canada she seemed
  surprised to hear that you had been gone. Slowly you came to the
  chilling conclusion that her mind was slowly going. Desperately
  you tried to convince her about it, but she refused adamantly -
  her will was as strong as ever, if blunted. You let doctors
  examine her, and they blamed Alzheimer's disease. A Master
  finally summoned from Paris examined her, and told you in hushed
  tones about how the minds of some old mages give away before the
  slow onslaught of time and paradox; they gradually sink into a
  diffuse Quiet with no escape. And Claudia was old, much older
  than she had admitted to you.
  </p>
  <p>
   You arranged for Claudia's care, but you felt dead inside.
  Even if she had often been arrogant and too convinced about her
  infallibility she had helped you see your duty. On your own it
  was so much harder, and you feared that the creeping grey
  nothingness that was slowly eating her mind would one day claim
  you. Then suddenly Master Weith appeared out of nowhere, dropping
  hints about a greater duty. At first you found him irritating and
  unsettling, but then he somehow convinced you.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Roleplaying tips

  You are a fighter - a polite, well

  apply the knowledge of the Order of Hermes to banish the shadows

  have a nagging suspicion that you have failed in the past,
  something you have to atone for.

  You have always been a curious person, even during
  your childhood in Edinburgh you couldn't resist the challenge of
  finding out the Secrets, and it often got you into trouble. But
  you learned, and at least outwardly you grew up into a serious
  but dynamic young man, itching for travel and exploration.
  <p>
   When you arrived in Egypt the first time you felt a sense of
  belonging. This was a land of limitless mystery, ancient secrets
  and buried treasures. You began to work as an assistant/bodyguard
  to some English archaeologists and geographers, from which you
  learned more and more about the land. You also began to notice
  some of the stranger things going on in Cairo, and was once
  nearly killed when you witnessed something that should not have
  been possible.
  </p>
  <p>
   Shortly afterwards you encountered Jonathan Cunningham of the
  Illustrious Temple of Amun the Unrevealed, alias the Luxor Club.
  Gradually you were introduced to the small chantry, where you
  studied Egyptology and hermeticism. Together you travelled across
  the land, studying the ancient secrets. In a great ceremony in
  the temple ruins in Karnak, you was formally initiated into the
  Temple.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eventually you found the Club too constricting; the mages of
  it seemed to prefer the abstraction of Egypt before the real
  thing, seldom leaving their studies and museums. And they
  couldn't fully accept your practical views on things and your
  interest in
   <i>
    modern
   </i>
   secrets. Exactly what was going on in
  the city?
  </p>
  <p>
   Everybody was surprised when you opened a carpet shop, and it
  survived - an European running a carpet shop in Cairo? Unheard
  of! Some even claimed you profiteered on the tourists, who felt
  more at ease in an European-inspired shop, and the guides you
  bribed better than anybody else to bring them there. But the real
  reason was of course that it was just a front; very few visitors
  found their way into the narrow alley off Sikkit al-badistan
  which was just as well, since the real business was in discreetly
  transporting old artefacts away from Egypt.
  </p>
  <p>
   The idea was originally due to your friend Jamal Haroun, who
  pointed out that some of your friends in the West Delta Transport
  Company might be able to discreetly transport away souvenirs
  without too much control - and that he had friends who might
  provide some interesting finds. Thinking it over you realised
  that this was an excellent way for the Order to both earn money
  and contacts (although of the shadier kind) and to keep an eye on
  the artefacts of Egypt - better that you smuggled them out than
  the Technocracy.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite some initial worries, your business works quite well,
  especially after the destruction of the Sittah wa ashrin chantry
  in 1971. Jamal and his friends has some very interesting finds to
  sell (and sometimes to buy; you have noticed that some groups
  want special items which you provide), and the revenue from your
  friends in Britain is quite good. You even have gained some
  feeling for the subtle dealings among the illuminated brethren,
  and can play their game rather well now. The only problem is Mme
  Yvette E. Granboul-Ponty. That lady knows too much, and she has
  connections. Exactly who she is and works for is so far a
  mystery, but she seems to be content for now to just keep a
  squeeze on you for her own reasons.

  He resides in a luxury apartment in central Cairo, surrounded by
  bodyguards, bootlickers (he is as vain as he is rich) and
  business people. You have not had much contact with him, but just
  the fact that you know about him and his people gives you a

  You are a Scotsman, and proud of it

  <p>
   You have always had an affinity for secrets, for the patterns

  the city behind the scenes, but you enjoy its great age, the
  ancient stones, the time that seems to be seeping from the
  gutters. All people and places have their secrets, you are just
  aware of them, gently watching.

  </blockquote>
  You grew up in the Cavendish family - there is not
  much more to say. For four generations you have been the
  gentleman (and gentlelady) hermetics of Britain, ever involved in
  the struggle to bring wisdom to the world and to balance the
  secret forces underlying society. At least that is how you want
  to appear to others.
  <p>
   Your father, Edmund Cavendish, believed in giving you a
  rigorous upbringing, as carefully planned as a grand evocation
  and not very different from his own Victorian upbringing. Your
  tutors imprinted the importance of correct behaviour, strength of
  character, responsibility and hermetic wisdom. You were taught
  how to read and write different languages, the secret symbolism
  of numbers, both the true and official versions of history, how
  to influence people and how to manage a business. The only thing
  he overlooked was small things like being present at birthdays or
  visiting your mother.
  </p>
  <p>
   When you was 24 you began to work in his office, and was
  officially initiated into the Seraphis Society. You worked hard
  to extend the family vision, at first overseen by the assistants
  of Father, later on your own with your own business. Things went
  well, you married a charming young lady of good family and the
  business grew. It was not that hard to become rich and
  influential, and your assistance to the Society and chantry
  proved your worth, even in the eyes of your father. You even gave
  what you saw as a good upbringing to your two children.
  </p>
  <p>
   But something was missing. As you celebrated your fortieth
  birthday, you realised that you had never
   <i>
    done
   </i>
   anything in
  your life, you had just executed a well written script without
  changing anything. You, your father, the whole Seraphis Society
  had worked hard to bring about the hermetic vision - but this was
  not the way. Becoming rich and influential, introducing
  politicians with Masonic orders and helping schools teach some of
  the truth was good, but it was not enough. You felt the need to
  actually help manifest the hermetic vision in the world directly,
  not just through mundane ploys. So when grandfather Arthur began
  to gather people for the Armorers, you requested admittance.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Influence
  </h3>
  You are a member of good standing in Seraphis
  Society (after all, your grandfather is the founder and Grand
  Architect of it, and your father is current Temple-measurer) and
  some other Masonic orders, both illuminated and not. You also
  have a wide network of contacts in Great Britain, old friends and
  acquaintances from Cambridge and various clubs you are a member
  in.
  <p>
   Your finances are excellent, your firm Cavendish Consultants
  Ltd. is quite profitable, and you invest wisely so that you, your
  family, your order and society at large will benefit.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Roleplaying tips
  </h3>
  You are utterly British, well bred, a
  bit conservative and quite charming. Even if you look down on
  some people, you don't show it and try to be as just as possible.
  You are also very generous, being a firm believer in "as ye sow
  shall ye reap" - something that might not be literally true, but
  has worked quite well for you so far. You are generous not only
  with money and help, but careful about giving the wrong kind of
  knowledge to people; some truths hurt.

  You have always been so much more alive than the
  others around you. Even when you were very young, your curiosity
  and drive gave your parents grey hairs despite their love for
  you. Sometimes you did things for no apparent reason, just
  because you felt you had to, like the summer you ran away,
  hitch-hiked to a small northern village and got lost in the
  woods; when the postman found you and helped you to the police
  station, you had no idea of why you had gone to such lengths to
  get to that place and what you had intended to do when you got
  there.
  <p>
   Your teenage rebellion was fearsome to behold, and a bit
  surprising to everyone ­ including yourself. After all, you
  had seemed to get along fine with your parents, and had shown no
  signs of disliking the lower-middle class lifestyle of them.
  Suddenly you were an activist and hippie, breaking free from the
  calcified society you had previously lived in.
  </p>
  <p>
   You grew up into yourself during the hippie era, sampling all
  of it from free love and drugs over politics to living in a
  neopagan collective. But unlike most other people, you learned
  something from it and began to synthesise your own vision from
  the hodge-podge of well-meaning ideas. You understood the truth
  that deep down everything is love without throwing away your
  common sense; instead you began to understand your previous
  impulses, your intense feeling of aliveness and perhaps even part
  of your true nature. Still, you were aware that things were not
  as bright and cheerful as your family in the collective wanted to
  think. Love and drive can be frightening too.
  </p>
  <p>
   After some years you had to leave. You didn't want to leave
  the collective, it had become your home, your family, your life.
  But you
   <i>
    had
   </i>
   to, something forced you away with a power you
  couldn't resist. With heavy heart you left, trying to figure out
  what forces really ruled your life. It was during your travels
  around England in a battered old Volkswagen you met William
  Stephenson. You knew he was the one, and soon you made him
  realise it too. You married, and bore him two children, Mary and
  Peter. From the outside, it looked as if you had gone completely
  normal. You even got a job at the local bookstore.
  </p>
  <p>
   But you knew his secret long before he dared to reveal it to
  you after much persuasion. You had felt it when you first saw
  him; this was a man who saw the secrets within the things. He had
  once been a powerful mage, involved in subtle intrigue and
  powerplay to bring enlightenment to the people. But after many
  years of essentially fruitless efforts, sad losses and a growing
  awareness of the pointlessness of the whole struggle he had
  walked out of the Order, trying to set up a normal life away from
  all the cosmic secrets and heavy responsibilities of an
  Awakened.
  </p>
  <p>
   Together you began to explore the secret truths. You showed
  him that there were things worth fighting for, a basic unity of
  existence that could unite simple loving family life with the
  struggle to define reality, and he showed you (at first
  reluctantly) how true magick actually worked. Your natural
  affinity with life, healing and growth flowered, which didn't
  surprise you. You became his student and mentor, and eventually
  he even introduced you to the mages at St. Vincent Manor. You
  quickly realised why your husband had left, but didn't condemn
  the other mages for their conservatism. It was a protective
  shell, helping them fight against a darkening world.
  </p>
  <p>
   But slowly you began to grow restless. Again, you knew that
  you would have to leave those you loved. This time you knew more
  about why - your Questing essence and strong Avatar were goading
  you on, but it didn't feel better for that. As gently you could,
  you broke up from William, Mary and Peter, promising them to
  return as often as possible. To some of the conservatives of St.
  Vincent this only proved that you were a bloody Verbena who
  didn't even love her own children and husband ­ but you
  didn't care about what they said. William seemed to understand,
  and offered to come with you, but he eventually understood that
  Peter and Mary needed him more. You left him as a sadder but
  whole man.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next years were spend travelling, exploring and
  understanding. You learned a lot, but you felt it was not the
  right knowledge. What you sought was deeper. For some reason you
  encountered Master Cavendish in London, who surprisingly
  suggested that you could follow him to Egypt. Of all the people
  at St. Vincent, he was the only one who stood up for you and
  William against the disapproval of the others; unlike most
  Masters he had kept his human heart. And there was something
  more, a premonition or intuitive feeling that suggested that you
   <i>
    would
   </i>
   follow him. Something in Egypt needs you.
