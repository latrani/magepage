   The Plan
  </h1>
  <blockquote>
   O King, you are this great star, the companion of Orion, who
    traverses the sky with Orion, who navigates the Duat with
    Osiris; you ascend from the East of the sky, being renewed at
    your due season...
   <cite>
    Pyramid Texts Utterance 466
   </cite>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
   The pyramids were a mirror image, the Earthly representation of
    the Belt of Orion, the destination of the dead King! The
    Egyptians were dualists -- everything they thought and believed
    was a duality. Everything had its counterpart, cause and
    effect, left and right, East and West, death and rebirth --
    nothing was ever seen in isolation. They had constructed at
    Giza an exact replica of the Duat destination of the King. Far
    from being a tomb, the pyramid was the starting point of the
    King's journey back to the stars from whence he came, back to
    the First Time.

  The Pattern consists of seven extremely powerful
  artificial nodes linked to each other and the Nile (represented
  by the temple of Sothis/Sirius) by ley-lines, consecrated in the
  honour of Horus and in the shape of the constellation Orion. If
  completed, it would act as a kind of portal between all the
  worlds, enabling Horus to manifest his idea in the physical world
  (and at least in theory to manifest physically too, although this
  is unlikely). Incidentally, it would also strengthen the Kingdom
  of Reeds significantly.
  <p>
   The pyramids of the Pattern are the three of Gizeh: Cheops,
  Chefren and Mykerinos, the step-pyramid of Saqquara and the
  unfinished pyramid of Abu Ruwash. In addition two more pyramids
  need to be built: one in the desert northwest of Gizeh, one near
  the Nile in the small village Turah. The stars correspond to the
  stars in Orion:

   The Pyramids are not arranged exactly as the stars of the
  constellation - the distances between them do not correspond
  exactly to the distances between the stars of Orion (the three
  central pyramids are much closer to each other than they should
  be if the distances were one-to-one). Instead, the distances
  correspond numerologically to each other according to the sizes
  of Pythagorean triangles. These are triangles with a right angle
  whose sides are integers (the simplest is the "Egyptian triangle"
  with sides 3,4 and 5). The Pattern consists of two major
  equilateral triangles meeting in the pyramid of Chefren, whose
  heights and sides form Pythagorean triangles.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Pieces of the Puzzle
  </h2>
  At the start of the chronicle,
  the Armorers know the general idea of the Pattern, and Rebecca
  has discovered the system of the Pythagorean triangles (something
  that has so far eluded all researchers). What they don't know is
  the exact angles of the main triangles, how to attune the
  pyramids, how to build them and the main consecration ritual.
  <h3>
   The Angles
  </h3>
  <img align="right" alt="" height="225" src="Mage/Egypt/Orion2.gif" width="150">
   Just knowing the positions of the current
  pyramids doesn't help determining exactly where the new ones
  should lie, unless the angles of the main triangles are found. It
  is not hard to make an educated guess, but to really succeed the
  angles have to be exact. That will also give the exact distances
  of the Pythagorean triangles.
   <p>
    One way to find out is to examine the desert, looking for
  clues. Unfortunately, the obelisk near Memphis marking the
  southern angle has long since been removed, and the northern
  angle was marked by a long, straight furrow now covered by sand.
  Another possibility is to try to correlate the angles with
  astronomy, but since the stars have moved this will not work
  either.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Attunement
   </h3>
   This is what links the pyramids together.
  Modern mages would likely think of using the Law of Similarity
  and build them exactly alike, but the builders of the Pattern
  instead made each pyramid unique and yet still similar. Their
  ratios (see sacred architecture) form an exact copy of the
  pattern in the ratio-space corresponding to the high umbral
  symbolism. This is not at all obvious unless the right measures
  are made. Today this is known only by the Luxor Club (Cunningham
  has found the pattern and drawn his own conclusions) and the
  Architects of Divine Measure.
   <p>
    Beside this resonance, the pyramids can and should be linked
  using Correspondence magick to make sure they are truly in
  contact and mutually reinforcing. This is ideally part of the
  final consecration of the Pattern.
   </p>

    Building Pyramids
   </h3>

    <blockquote>
     The Magician must build all that he has into his pyramid; and
    if that pyramid is to touch the stars, how broad must be the
    base! There is no knowledge and no power which is useless to
    the Magician. One might almost say there is no scrap of
    material in the whole Universe with which he can dispense. His
    ultimate enemy is the great Magician, the Magician who created
    the whole illusion of the Universe; and to meet him in battle,
    so that nothing is left either of him or of yourself, you must
    be exactly equal to him.

    Pyramids are the pinnacle of sacred architecture:
  simple, yet very powerful magickal buildings. Their power lies in
  their internal geometry, which enables them to express
  geometrical ratios which link strongly with very significant
  numbers in the high umbra and to bring their power into
  manifestation as an artificial node with a pre-determined
  resonance.
    <p>
     It is not absolutely necessary to build a pyramid in the shape
  of a classical pyramid; somebody skilled enough in sacred
  architecture could construct a building of another shape with the
  same effect. The same goes for material: steel and concrete could
  replace granite and limestone. What is important is the main
  consecrations and the structure.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of the tricks used in the pyramids is the empty chambers;
  small chambers in the structure which both decrease the weight,
  introduce beneficial ratios and house stones specially
  consecrated to protect the structure. These chambers tend to
  "drift" into the Umbra once the pyramid is finished, making them
  very hard to find and ideal places to hide secrets.
    </p>
    <p>
     The "capping ritual" completes the pyramid. Despite the myth,
  the pyramids never had any pyramidal capstones. Instead a small
  but perfect pattern of pure Quintessence was created at the apex,
  linking to the pyramid and completing its connection with the
  Tapestry. If done correctly, the pyramid's astral form would
  become self-reinforcing and awaken the internal node.
    </p>
    <p>
     Today these secrets except for the consecration rituals are
  known by the Architects, although none have ever tried actually
  using them (the capping ritual still exists partially in the form
  of a Masonic roof-laying ceremony). The consecrations are
  discussed in De Pyramidis et Secretum Aegyptorum (Vol III) by
  Hartwright- Carter, and a competent team of hermetic mages who
  knew about the basics of sacred architecture could develop them
  again.
    </p>
    <h4>
     How to Build a Pyramid
    </h4>
    The first step is to plan the
  pyramid according to sacred architecture. Its position has to
  align with the stars, the current and future ley-lines (since the
  introduction of the pyramid will change them), the Nile and most
  importantly, its internal structure has to contain the proper
  ratios so that the Quintessence will focus in a central pillar of
  power. A mistake can turn out to be disastrous, as the pyramid
  becomes unstable and is damaged by entropic forces.
    <p>
     The next step is to lay the proper foundation, the stone that
  will act as the occult foundation. It has to be cut exactly right
  from the best possible stone, purified and sanctified, and when
  it has been placed in the right place, it has to be the altar of
  a sacrifice to bind it to the fields of Prime and Spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
     During the building, daily consecrations and purifications
  should be done, mostly to keep the pyramid free from disruptive
  influences and bind it together as an occult whole. Prime is
  channelled into its pattern, spirits are bound to protect it and
  Matter/Entropy magick is used to reinforce it. Several larger
  ceremonies have to be celebrated at crucial points, such as the
  completion of the central chamber when a sacrifice has to be
  made. Of course, these purifications could be done in secret or
  camouflaged as other things.
    </p>
    <p>
     Eventually, when the pyramid is physically completed it has to
  be given the final consecration. This was usually linked with the
  burial of the pharaoh. At first the priests cleanses and purifies
  the exterior, central chamber and apex. Then sacrifices are
  brought to the top, and the apex pattern is placed at the apex as
  Prime and Spirit magicks are woven to link it, the central
  chamber, the foundation stones and the world together. At this
  moment the pyramid truly becomes a pyramid, and will turn into an
  artificial node. Usually several protective spells are added to
  the ceremony, fuelled by the huge quintessence flows.
    </p>
    <h3>
     The Purification and Consecration of the Grand Pattern
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
     <i>
      Consecration is the active dedication of a thing to a single
    purpose
     </i>
     . Banishing prevents its use for any other purpose,
    but it remains inert until consecrated. Purification is
    performed by water, and banishing by air, whose weapon is the
    sword. Consecration is performed by fire, usually symbolised by
    the holy oil.

    Practice

    This ritual is the ritual needed to purify the
  Pattern, connect the pyramids to each other, dedicate the Pattern
  to Horus and "awakening" it. The ritual begins when Orion rises.
  It consists of four necessary steps:
    <p>
     Purifying and Banishing of the Pattern: This step could be
  prepared and performed over a long time before the rest of the
  main ritual, perhaps combined with setting up wards and other
  protections. Disruptive influences must be banished from the
  pattern, both physically and spiritually. The first step is an
  elaborate purification of each pyramid, followed by purifications
  of the connecting ley- lines and then a purification of the whole
  pattern. Once the pattern is pure, a banishing ceremony is
  performed to keep out the influences of Set and other negative
  powers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bringing the Pyramids to Each Other: if they have been
  attuned, then this is just a Prime-Correspondence effect to link
  them together during the ritual and in the future. The ley-lines
  between them will awaken.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dedication to Horus: the link between the Pattern and Horus is
  opened in a grand invocation, where the participating mages name
  the many secret names of the God and inscribe them into the
  Pattern. This is mainly a Prime-Spirit effect.
    </p>
    <p>
     Opening of the Mouth: the final step is to make the Pattern
  "alive", to make it an active force of Horus (if this is not
  done, it is just an effigy of the god). This uses all spheres,
  seeking to allow the Pattern-Horus to use them all. This must be
  concluded when Orion reaches it's zenith (if this is to occur at
  midnight too, the ritual must be performed at December 13).
    </p>
    <p>
     This ritual was never performed, and just something planned by
  the great mages behind the Pattern. Rediscovering it requires
  significant research; the purification and connection parts are
  fairly easy today, and an egyptologically knowledgeable hermetic
  mage could with some work develop the Opening of the Mouth
  section, but the Dedication requires a list of the Seven Secret
  Most Holy Names of Horus, which was hard to find even in the Old
  Kingdom. In addition, today a very elaborate "stealth effect" may
  be needed to protect the ritual and the participants from
  unwelcome attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     It should be noted that most of the ritual will take place on
  top of the pyramids, giving the participants access to enormous
  amounts of quintessence (especially since this is the conclusion
  of the Pattern - they were built partially for this purpose, and
  their resonance will strongly help mages in this).
