       <h2>
        History
       </h2>
       The Temple was built sometime during the third or
  fourth dynasty, serving as the official timekeepers and
  astronomers of Egypt. The priesthood of Sothis supported the
  Pattern the strongest, and was hence crushed by Set, using the
  priests of Ra in the fifth dynasty. So successful was the purge
  that practically nothing is today known about the priesthood of
  Sothis; its secrets were assimilated by the priests of Thoth. The
  Temple was abandoned, and soon covered with sand and silt. Within
  a century it vanished.

       <h2>
        Location
       </h2>
       During the digging of the Cairo subway (a truly
  apocalyptic project, as somebody put it) workers found ancient
  masonry and statues in an area corresponding to an old riverbank
  beneath central Cairo. More carefully digging revealed the
  remnants of the Temple of Sothis-Isis; goddess of the flooding.
       <p>
        To get to the temple a visitor will have to enter the
  subway-to-be through one of the construction sites in central
  Cairo. The tunnel is dimly lit by flickering fluorescent lamps,
  revealing big concrete braces holding it up. Transport is done
  using noisy trolleys along temporary rails. Around 400 meters in,
  the tunnel ends at the dig.
       </p>
       <p>
        The dig is an irregular series of chambers, with walls and
  roof held up by makeshift pylons and lamps strung out randomly.
  The first chamber seems to correspond to the remains of a
  colonnade, with fallen pylons and one very well-preserved sphinx.
  This is fairly well studied, and the dig has continued to the
  second chamber, which corresponds to a small hypostyle hall and
  an antechamber. The walls and most pylons appear to have
  collapsed, but the inscriptions are quite readable (see finds
  below). The dig has currently reached the entrance to the
  sanctuary, a doorway filled with silt.
       </p>
       <h2>
        The Dig
       </h2>
       <a name="jonathan">
       </a>
       Currently a team led by
  Professor Jonathan Ritter from Cornell University are trying to
  catalogue and save the ruins. He is an experienced archaeologist,
  used to dealing with Egyptian bureaucracy (even if the constant
  fight with the transport authority who want to continue building
  the tunnel is a new experience to him) and troublesome digs. He
  is well aware that the temple is an unique find, and will go to
  any length to understand it. Of course, given his sleeper
  perspective he is not likely to understand the real importance of
  the temple.
       <p>
        Beside the professor there are a number of his graduate
  students, several Egyptian archaeologists and some workers at the
  dig.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mme Granboul-Ponty is quietly keeping an eye on the dig; she
  is not that worried by it (there are many much more active sites
  in Egypt), but it is best to be on the certain side.
       </p>
       <h2>
        Dangers
       </h2>
       The whole place is insufficiently stabilised, and
  cave-ins and mudflows are a constant danger. The ruins tend to be
  surrounded by a lot of silt, which must be digged or blown away.
  It is extremely moist and dark in the dig, with dripping water
  everywhere and pumps trying to remove it. To make matters even
  worse, there are irregular blackouts as the makeshift electrical
  system is short-circuited.
       <h2>
        Finds
       </h2>
       The prize find is both several walls with almost
  legible paintings and inscriptions telling the story of the year,
  delineating the feasts, the way Thoth won the five
  celebration-days from Khonsu and some myths about Isis, and the
  ruined remnants of a wall bearing an early map of the Nile.
       <p>
        Study of the ruins reveals signs that the temple was
  abandoned, probably at the end of the fifth dynasty.
  Archaeological studies imply that the duty of master timekeeping
  was in the hands of the priesthood of Ra and Thoth beyond this
  time. It is strange that so little is mentioned about the cult of
  Sothis, it may have been local.
       </p>
       <p>
        The sanctum, which has not yet been dug out, is empty. On the
  throne where the statue of Sothis would have been there is
  nothing. No ceremonial objects remain, but the engravings in the
  wall give a long adoration to Sothis and her mastery over the
  Nile, and her role in protecting and nurturing the Horus child.
  The ceiling is painted with an elaborate sky map, with Sothis and
  the constellation Orion/Horus in clear view.
       </p>
       <p>
        It bears the inscription "The Great Warrior Horus, King of the
  Land". Intriguingly, the stars are marked with cartouches
  containing their old names; if somebody compares this to old
  texts about the pyramids they will see that these star names are
  sometimes mentioned in connection with them, fitting the Pattern
  perfectly. In addition, there are two lines from the
  constellation linked to stars with names that can be shown to
  correspond to two landmarks - this reveals the correct angles of
  the Pattern.
       </p>
       <h2>
        Magickal Aspects
       </h2>
       This place feels old, and strangely out
  of place. It should be up among the stars instead of beneath the
  ground. It may once have been a node, but now it is quiescent.
       <p>
        Trond will get an intense vision if he enters the temple, that
  will send him into a frenzy: How priests of Re, together with the
  soldiers of the king approach the temple and begin to loot it.
  The priests go into the sanctum and remove the holy papyri and
  the goddess! They claim they do it on the order of the king, to
  bring her to Heliopolis. For a while Trond will speak with the
  voice of Neberkerm, the priest of Sothis. An old, frightened and
  desperate man who pleads for the return of the treasures of the
  temple.
