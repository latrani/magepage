   The Ahl-I-Batini of Cairo
  </h1>
  The Ahl-I-Batin have a long
  history in Egypt, but have suffered greater losses than any other
  tradition. Still, they remain the undisputed experts on the
  shadows of Cairo - they founded the city.

   The Darwushim are the batini mystics who do not concern
  themselves with organisations or the politics of the mundane
  world, although ideologically they are somewhat on the side of
  the choristers (who tend to ignore them as long as they do not
  try to spread heretical ideas among the congregation). They
  concentrate on their mystical vision of unity with God, usually
  living hermit lives in the desert.

   This group, dating back to the 9th century, unites hermetic,
  gnostic and sufi thinking. They have in the past been one of the
  strongest links between the batini and the Order of Hermes,
  strongly supporting the Library of Alexandria (in fact, they were
  its guardians for a long time and still work closely together
  with the hermetics and Alexandrian Society in that city), but
  also deeply involved in the Ismailiyah, the Ismailite sect of
  Islam.
  </p>
  <p>
   They revealed their existence in the late 9th century by
  spreading Rasail Ikhwan al-Safa (The Epistles of the Brethren of
  Purity), but never worked openly. Instead they prepared the way
  for the Fatimid invasion of Egypt, secretly hoping to harness the
  mystical power of the land. In fact, their long-range plan was to
  create a new caliphate organised after their hidden knowledge, a
  mystical empire that would rule the centre of the world. They
  convinced the rulers to found al-Khaira (Cairo) south of the
  delta so that they could harness the rich nodes in the area.
  Allied with the Architects of Divine Measure they built many
  mosques and the citadel to focus the quintessence into divine
  patterns.
  </p>
  <p>
   But their rise to power created opposition among other mages,
  and the Cult of Nun rose against them. Suffering from subtle
  attacks and intrigue from the outside and nephandic corruption
  from the inside their grand scheme crumbled. To escape their
  enemies some fled into Persia or India, others hid in plain sight
  in Egypt.
  </p>
  <p>
   For many decades, the Brethren bided their time, planning
  their next move. They infiltrated the mamuluk slaves who were
  becoming the de facto rulers (in many cases they simply bought
  child slaves and indoctrinated them from the beginning, creating
  fanatically loyal allies in the court), using them at first to
  influence politics and then to write politics. Unfortunately the
  mamuluk government was both unstable and violent; soon the
  Brethren found themselves enmeshed in the infighting on all
  sides, and their own alliances made the situation even worse. The
  different cells of Brethren spread across Cairo and Egypt
  couldn't coordinate, and instead began to fight. The struggle
  continued for centuries, the once powerful Brethren becoming
  little more than a minor conspiracy in a kingdom wracked by
  intrigue.
  </p>
  <p>
   When the Ottoman empire invaded, the last remnants of the true
  Brethren vanished into the Library of Alexandria, and the
  remaining power-mongers began to coalesce into two fractions, the
  Dhu 'l-Faqariyyah and the Qasimiyyah. As they Bays grew in power,
  the struggle grew hotter, and the sides began to splinter again
  into vicious infighting. The Technocracy was secretly using this
  to prepare for their next step: the conquest of Egypt.
  </p>
  <p>
   The technomancers had in secret already made alliances with
  some of the Brethren, promising help against the other fractions
  in exchange for minor support. Their real plan was to leak the
  information in order to start infighting when Napoleon Bonaparte
  landed. It didn't work perfectly; the Brethren, other Batini and
  Choristers realised who the real enemy was and began to fight
  back together. But the seeds had been sown, and the treachery
  soon blossomed into an internal struggle that effectively removed
  the Brethren from the political arena for several years. That was
  enough for the technomancers to consolidate their power in Egypt,
  and to insert their man Muhammed Ali as ruler. He efficiently
  wiped out the remaining Batini resistance and began to bring
  Egypt into the technocratic world.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the nineteenth and twentieth century the Brethren have
  slowly, slowly made a comeback. They have in many ways learned
  from their fatal mistakes, and instead seek to influence things
  from the shadows instead of standing behind the throne. They are
  divided into three main groups: the Brethren of Purity and
  Balance, the Scholars of Light and the Ismailites.
  </p>
  <p>
   <a name="brethrenofpurity">
   </a>
   The Brethren of Purity and
  Balance represents the "reformist" political and economical
  manipulators, doing their best to manipulate the shadows of
  Cairo. They are powerbrokers, fixers, plotters and politicians.
  Up until recently they did well by acting as middle-men in deals
  between different groups, selling occult artefacts or services to
  other magickal groups and generally acting like a big information
  network. The rise of fundamentalism has however placed them in an
  unenviable position where just about everybody is demanding them
  to take a side, and if they take a side they will betray many of
  their secret alliances.
  </p>
  <p>
   <a name="scholars">
   </a>
   The Scholars of Light are descended
  from the Brethren who joined with the Library and have devoted
  themselves to the study of the unity and magick instead of
  practical politics. They are intellectuals and thinkers, and have
  in the past worked closely together with the choristers. But
  today the fundamentalists are pressuring them strongly to join in
  the jihad or be destroyed. The Scholars are desperately trying to
  find a way out, but it is clear that sooner or latter they need
  to take a side. They still have a presence at al-Azhar, although
  the fundamentalists are forcing them out there too.
  </p>
  <p>
   <a name="ismailites">
   </a>
   The Ismailites are in many ways the
  most conservative group, trying to bring back the grand visions
  of the Fatimid era. They are attempting to unify all the
  dispersed Brethren through the return of Aga Khan to Egypt, a
  secret signal for the faithful to join together again in unity.
  The eventual outcome of this scheme is uncertain, especially
  since the fundamentalists are pressuring the Ismailites to become
  more mainstream Muslims (to them, the Ismailites are ghulat,
  heretical extremists).

  <h3>
   Jamal Haroun, Go-Between for the Brethren of Purity and
  Balance
  </h3>
  Jamal was born in a small village near Luxor. His
  father worked his way up from errand boy to tourist guide to
  shopkeeper, freeing the family from a long history of poverty.
  Jamal even went to school before going in his fathers footsteps
  as a tourist guide - and smuggler. The village people had always
  known the temples, tombs and monuments in the region intimately;
  once their ancestors built them, and other ancestors had
  plundered them. By rights they were theirs, so why not earn a
  little on the side by selling some finds? Jamal used his position
  as a tourist guide to find prospective buyers (mostly rich
  westerners, easy to fool) and to get certain packages through
  airport security. He did well, his wit and charm was a perfect
  combination in his line of business.
  <p>
   The world of discreet trade in ancient Egyptian objects has
  many players, and one of them discovered Jamal. He was good at
  what he did, but he held the potential for something more. He was
  invited by one of his Egyptian customers to Cairo, to meet some
  new, well-connected business contacts. That meeting changed his
  life; he suddenly realised how petty his earlier ambitions had
  been, and what a challenge the shadows of Cairo promised. Over a
  period of several years he travelled between Luxor and Cairo,
  transporting certain objects, people and messages between
   <i>
    very
   </i>
   unexpected individuals. It was a form of training,
  giving him the insight into the real goings on and the contact
  needed for his ambitions to really reach fruition. After a while
  he had established his position, and settled down in Cairo as a
  general go-between, fixer and contact person. His allegiance was
  not so much to any special group as to the game itself, the
  wheeling and dealing in the shadows, illegal clubs and on hidden
  cafés.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jamal is a charming, witty man who loves to play the subtle
  and inscrutable Egyptian gentleman to naive westerners (and the
  even subtler Ahl-I-Batini to naive mages). In reality he is a man
  who loves to be in the midst of things, to act as an arbiter or
  fixer in no matter how small deals or intrigues. He really likes
  people, especially if he feels he knows their weaknesses and
  quirks, and manages to get along with most others. He has had
  some run-ins with the fanatics of Muhammad's gang and is cautious
  about Mme Granboul-Ponty, but otherwise he thinks he can deal
  with the backstage of Cairo quite well. He is of course dead
  wrong, but would quite likely manage to improvise well even if he
  found out the real depths - there is nothing he likes better than
  to instantly adapt.
  </p>

   Quote: "By the grace of Allah, I happen to have a relative who
  happens to have a house most suitable to your needs. And,
  amazingly enough, he is willing to rent it out since he is going
  on holiday. Surely a most amazing coincidence, yes?"
   <a name="zada">
   </a>
  </p>
  <h3>
   The Zada family
  </h3>
  This upper middle class family is centred
  around the imposing bulk of professor Sadi Zada, a historian at
  Cairo University. It is a large, boisterous and active family
  with branches just about everywhere, connections and allies in
  the strangest places.
  <p>
   Professor Zada has himself contact with several magickal
  groups, most notably the Scholars of Light, where he has a high
  rank. He is not a major mage, but rather a skilled historian and
  thinker who is more interested in how things are, was and will be
  than how they could be. He is doing his best to protect the
  Scholars (and himself and his family, mind you) from the attacks
  from the Shayks, but it is an uphill struggle and several of his
  friends have been jailed, persecuted or murdered. He is gradually
  reaching the unpalatable conclusion that to save what he believes
  in the Scholars need to ally with a greater power - but the only
  alternatives at present are the Technocracy and the Shayks. If
  the liberal choristers could be united with the Scholars and
  Brethren against the fundamentalists, then they could stand a
  chance, but lacking cohesion and leadership this is unlikely.

   The links between architecture and magick date back to the
  time of Imhotep, and have always been strong in Egypt. The
  architect- mages of ancient Egypt practised their art for at
  least 2000 years before being eclipsed by other traditions and
  changing politics (it appears likely that the Messianic Voices of
  the Celestial Chorus worked against them, since they felt it was
  wrong to attempt to channel divine power through mere stone). But
  the architects had spread to other lands, and their teachings
  took root among the batini.
  </p>
  <p>
   When the Arabs conquered Egypt, they returned and began to
  build anew, hiding their skills in mosques, citadels and
  channels. They explored the old ruins, relearning many forgotten
  skills. Deciding to keep the sacred truths hidden from all others
  they thoroughly erased all traces of them in Egypt, destroying
  old temples and removing the hieroglyphs covering the pyramids;
  their motto was "The secret shall be secret". Through the
  crusades and wandering masons their secrets still spread to
  Europe, where they led to the formation of the Craftsmasons (who
  eventually helped form the Order of Reason). But the knowledge of
  how to channel Quintessence using Quanats and how to create new
  nodes remained hidden.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the Mamuluk and Ottoman rulership they slowly dwindled,
  with the occasional resurgence. During the British occupation
  there was a brief resurgence as the Architects came into contact
  and assimilated a dynamic group of British freemasons; they built
  the Garden City to "test" the old magick (creating an unique
  environment of flowing quintessence) and the neo-pharaonic tomb
  of Sa'd Zaghlul, which was in fact a fully functional
  mini-pyramid in central Cairo. Unfortunately their activities
  were noted by opposing groups, and during the next years the
  Architects were forced underground.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Architects have never had much power over mundane society,
  preferring to keep their secrets to themselves. Instead they have
  relied on other groups of mages seeking their help in
  rechanneling quintessence and locking reality in place. For the
  greatest secret of sacred architecture is how to use buildings on
  powerful nodes to enforce the paradigm they were built in,
  something both the builders of pyramids, mosques, cathedrals and
  skyscrapers have used, consciously or not.
  </p>
  <p>
   Today the Architects of Divine Measure is a dwindling group;
  few new buildings are built according to their teachings, and the
  Technocracy has acquired most nodes. Still, they hang on and
  await the day when sacred architecture will again rise to the
  skies. Most members are old architects, builders or geologists,
  watching over their hidden libraries and studios. In fact, they
  are slowly forgetting the true nature of magick, becoming just
  protectors of their old traditions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Their headquarters is the home of Qansuh Shaqra, an old and
  obscure architect living in the suburbs of northern Cairo, in a
  large and strange villa with a small tower (he designed it
  himself, according to the principles of sacred architecture; it
  is supernaturally very well protected even if it looks odd).
  Qansuh is one of the students of Mustafa Fahmi, the architect who
  built the tomb of Sa'd Zaghlul, and his appointed successor as
  leader of the Architects. In his house they keep some of their
  sacred scriptures (including some very old and powerful copies of
  ancient Egyptian texts that many mages would be willing to kill
  to get, had they known about them. The Architects, on the other
  hand, do not understand their significance), sculptures, models,
  maps and tools. Most of the members are older architects, but
  when dealing with other groups (which is very rare nowadays, they
  are completely out of touch with other mages) they send their
  youngest member Yusuf Mina who is just middle-aged.

  <h3>
   Sacred Architecture
  </h3>
  <blockquote>
   In Plato's Timaeus, there appears the earliest known equation
    of the Creator with the 'Architect of the Universe'. The
    Creator, in the Timaeus, is called 'tekton', meaning
    'craftsman' or 'builder'. 'Arche-tekton' thus denoted 'master
    craftsman' or 'master builder'. For Plato, the 'arche-tekton'
    crafted the cosmos by means of geometry.
   <cite>
    Baigent &amp;
    Leigh, The Temple and the Lodge
   </cite>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
   The Pyramids speak the language of geometry
  </blockquote>
  The basic idea of sacred architecture is to give
  geometric relations physical shape, thus linking the physical
  with the higher realms. By choosing the right ratios and shapes,
  the building can be given almost any magickal function just as if
  it was a permanent magickal effect. The power lies not so much in
  consecrations and ceremonies (although they are commonly used
  too) but in the structure itself - as long as it is sufficiently
  complete it will have power and resonance.
  <p>
   Sacred Architecture was discovered/invented by Imhotep, who
  used it to structure the then rather unstable reality of Egypt
  and to give his king a truly eternal afterlife. He not only
  discovered how to channel Quintessence in stone and geometry, but
  also how to create new nodes by building pyramids and how to
  dedicate their power into different magickal effects. He also
  realised one of its dangers: if buildings with the same magickal
  ratios were built accidentally aligned, they would become linked.
  This could overcome distances, but it could also lead to
  unexpected and dangerous side effects as resonance spread. That
  was why he ordained that the knowledge of sacred architecture was
  to be kept secret - as long as a single group controlled it,
  there was little chance of misuse.
  </p>
  <p>
   The basic trick is very simple. Each building contains a
  number of ratios between lengths (such as the ratio between
  height and width, the ratio between the diameter and height of
  pillars etc) and angles. Some of these ratios are important, and
  if two buildings share the same ratios or have ratios that lie on
  the same line in a abstract, possibly multidimensional space
  determined by the structure of the building, then the two
  buildings will be linked. Certain ratios also link the building
  to certain high umbral concepts, and if done correctly these
  concepts can be invoked. The most obvious such ratio is the
  golden ratio, which symbolises stability, perfection and
  harmony.
  </p>
  <p>
   Designing a building along these principles is a complex art,
  since by just fixing a few major ratios many unwanted angles and
  correspondences might appear (this is why some of the early
  pyramids failed, they had the wrong angles). Many secondary
  ratios are needed to correct this, making the building more
  complicated.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the construction, certain rituals are commonly use to
  reinforce it. Some of them are just basic utility-magick for
  strengthening it, removing flaws from stones and ensuring
  stability. others are more esoteric, aimed at tuning the building
  to its magickal purpose. The most well-known ceremony is laying
  down the foundation stone: the construction starts with
  consecrating a single, perfect stone expressing the three
  fundamental ratios and placing it at the metaphysical foundation
  of the building. In the past, it was often filled with
  quintessence from a sacrifice. Another important ceremony is
  placing the cornerstone: this completes the magickal structure
  (or part of it), activating it and giving it power. Often this
  was done with a similarly consecrated stone.
  </p>
  <p>
   In Egypt, the most obvious examples of sacred architecture
  beside the pyramids and some of the temples (which have set down
  significant ley-lines between them) is the mosques that channel
  the quintessence into the Web of Faith. Through more than a
  millennium the Architects have worked on this elaborate system,
  creating a pattern of stability and belief that rivals the
  Pattern of the pyramids (what the later lacks in size and number
  of nodes is balanced by its sheer power and simplicity).
  </p>
  <p>
   One arabian invention was the secret language of arabesques;
  these abstract patters can be designed to contain ratios and
  angles relating to high umbral concepts, and thus convey secret
  messages. Many of the buildings created by the Architects are
  marked with these inscriptions, hidden in plain sight.
