   Introduction
  </h1>
  <blockquote>
   Investigation of natural phenomena and confrontation with the
    'mysterious' mattered deeply to the ancient egyptians, even if
    there was not always an explanation and if the result was
    occasionally incomprehensible and contradictory. Consequently,
    metaphysical myths of creation and magickal formulae directed
    against the forces of chaos - manifest in the threat of the
    underworld snake Apophis - signify that the ancient Egyptian
    quest for ultimate knowledge.

  The Land of Horus is an epic chronicle for Mage,
  detailing the quest of a hermetic cabal to complete an ancient
  ritual and open a new era. It takes place in Egypt, both ancient
  and modern, dealing with the many-layered conflicts of the
  Ascension War and the lure of antique mysteries.
  <h2>
   The Story
  </h2>
  The cabal, the
  <a href="Mage/Egypt/Armorers.html">
   Armorers of Orion
  </a>
  , was formed to investigate and explore the
  mysteries of the Pattern, an ancient ritual of cosmic power that
  was almost completed by the mage-priests Old Kingdom. As the
  chronicle unfolds, the mages learn more about it and begin
  attempt to complete it; if they can succeed they will bring about
  a profound change in the world and possibly fulfil some of their
  personal destinies.
  <p>
   But there are many dangers on the path. The Ascension War is
  heating up in Egypt as fundamentalism clashes with the
  Technocracy, secret societies manipulate events behind the scenes
  and a shadowy group of Nephandi seek to turn the Nile valley red
  with blood. On a higher level, the ancient gods are awakening as
  the mages begin to look into mysteries left alone for millennia;
  some will oppose them, some will support them. Finally, there is
  the ever-present danger of hubris and personal ambition.
  </p>
  <p>
   The chronicle is divided into three parts. Part I, Osiris,
  deals with the formation and arrival of the cabal in Egypt,
  setting up a base of operation, meeting some of the Awakened
  inhabitants of Cairo and learning about the pyramids. Part II,
  Isis, revolves around their attempts to complete the Pattern and
  to survive in the heating Ascension War. Part III, Horus, deals
  with the final attempt to complete the Pattern and change the
  world.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Theme
  </h2>
  The theme is struggle and the quest for balance in
  the face of chaos and opposition. Egypt is brimming with
  conflicts: between Islamic and Western values, between different
  traditions and the Technocracy, between Set and Horus, between
  past and present. How can these conflicts be resolved? By one
  side winning and vanquishing the other? By compromise? Or by
  changing the rules of the game?
  <p>
   The cabal is seeking to fathom an ancient mystery and to
  complete it despite the raging Ascension War, millennia of
  secrecy and dangerous pitfalls. On all sides forces, both
  material and spiritual, are trying to push things in their
  direction; only by balancing fire with water, air with earth and
  light by dark can the mages prevent failure and bring about the
  great transformation they seek.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Mood
  </h2>
  Epic/hermetic. As the Millennium draws close,
  ancient visions and schemes begin to unfold, seeking to bring
  about a great change -- or to prevent it. Powers on all planes
  from the physical to the divine are becoming involved, covertly
  influencing events. Everything is secretly symbolic, hiding
  secrets and hints if one can read it. Omens and mysteries hint at
  greater patterns, and the simpleminded will be fooled by
  appearances into destruction.
  <p>
   Ancient mysteries, secrets hiding secrets. Everybody is
  struggling to find and solve the Enigma of Egypt, the key to
  Ascension. This is where the Earth was first formed, this was
  were the gods trod the land, this was were the spirit world and
  material world was first sundered. If one can find the primeval
  mound and use its power, the cosmos can be remade - or
  unmade.
  </p>
  <p>
   Egypt and its history weighs heavily even on mages. It may not
  be possible to change Egypt, but Egypt changes you.
