  <h1>
   The Secret Agendas
  </h1>
  <h2>
   Master Weith and the Prieure de Sion
  </h2>
  While Master
  Cavendish sees the Armorers and the Pattern as a great chance to
  further the hermetic vision, Master Weith is more focused. He has
  realised that the completion of the Pattern would not only be a
  great achievement for the Order of Hermes, it would also bring
  widespread recognition among the Traditions to the mages who
  pulled it off. He fully intends to orchestrate a turning point in
  hermetic history using the Armorers.
  <p>
   Like all illuminated plans his vision works on several levels.
  On the lowest, mundane level it will bring together hermetic
  mages from very different parts of the order, and encourage more
  cooperation. On the intellectual level it will symbolise how the
  Order restores the rightful order of things to reality, something
  he knows the Masters will notice. And on the spiritual level,
  great power will be concentrated in this great task - it can
  probably be directed towards bringing about some ancient
  prophecies and emblems, furthering his vision of unity among the
  traditions and the order.
  </p>
  <p>
   The centrepiece in his plans on this level is Philippe. Being
  of the holy blood, he is protected by the
   <a href="Mage/Egypt/Prieure.html">
    Prieure de Sion
   </a>
   , which is secretly allied with the
  Merovingians of the Celestial Chorus; in fact, both groups are
  really fronts for the same conspiracy-in-the-conspiracy. Master
  Weith knows this, and plans to use it to bring the Holy Blood
  conspiracy along in his scheme to unite the Order of Hermes by
  involving Philippe in the Pattern. The Prieure thinks they are
  infiltrating the Armorers, when it is really the opposite.
  </p>
  <p>
   What he didn't fully realise was the ideas of the
   <a href="Mage/Egypt/Priestesses.html">
    Priestesses of Isis
   </a>
   . When they learn about the presence of
  Philippe, they will immediately identify him as one of the
  descendants of Osiris (the links between Christ, Dumuzi, Osiris
  and the other incarnations of the sacrificed god of crops and
  light are strong and pure). He simply has to be united with a
  descendant of Isis (which incidentally would give the Priestesses
  more control over the situation). When they realise the full
  extent of the project they will be more or less forced to support
  the Armorers, a completely unexpected synergy with the vision of
  Master Weith - if these two unrelated conspiracies could ally,
  then they would not only have great political and magickal
  potential behind themselves, but also the mystical union of Isis
  and Osiris.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Egyptian Connection
  </h2>
  Francis Lloyd McPatric is
  involved in many of the secret goings-on, and Master Weith
  doesn't know half of it.
  <p>
   McPatric has some ties to the Luxor Club (after all, he is
  still formally a member), but he is also in contact with both the
  Scholars of Light, the Brethren of Purity and Balance and the
  West Delta Transport Company. In fact, he is used as a kind of
  go-between for several of the fractions in the Delta.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jamal Haroun is of the Brethren of Purity and Balance, and
  originally suggested that McPatric would participate in their
  trade in artefacts. By setting up a system where the Brethren and
  their contacts sold him the artefacts, and he sold them to the
  West via the Transport Company, they both enmeshed him in their
  network (the money was secondary) and opened a way to smuggle
  things in and out of the country without having to go through the
  Alexandria Library, which for a long time has become more and
  more otherworldly and enmeshed in obscure politics with rival
  fractions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Scholars of Light took and interest and began to help
  McPatric, both to prevent the Brethren from manipulating him and
  to make him a useful go- between in their schemes. They also
  provided him with his secret bodyguard Hesham El-Telbani;
  McPatric suspects that he is more able than he admits, but
  doesn't realise his true abilities. The Zada family actively
  protects him, which has given them an edge since the Brethren of
  Purity and Balance feel obliged to help them too.
  </p>
  <p>

   Mme Yvette E. Granboul-Ponty knows about
  the secret trade, but realises that it is not as important as
  defeating the Shayks of the White Night. So she keeps some
  pressure on McPatric, keeping him and his contacts cautious and
  nervous, planning to force them to cooperate as soon as she finds
  an use for them. The Brethren know of this, and plan to use it in
  another way - by leading her to believe that they are dependent
  on McPatric, they can develop their own networks and in the worst
  case sacrifice him, like a lizard dropping its tail. The Scholars
  of Light have guessed their plan, but want to keep McPatric in
  business as much as possible, while they do their best to arrange
  that he wont get into contact with the Shayks
  </p>
  <p>
   The Shayks know about McPatric's business but do not care one
  bit about it.
  </p>

   <a name="khaled">
   </a>
   Khaled El-Rifaie is a wildcard. He
  doesn't work for
   <i>
    anybody
   </i>
   , neither is he Awakened. Who he
  really is is anybody's guess. But he knows enough to skilfully
  manipulate the local power-games to his profit. He has
  successfully woven a web of connections across Egypt and the Arab
  world, knows about many of the darker secrets of reality and
  seems to be determined to stay on top forever. His power is not
  uncontested, and some of the local crimelords (perhaps supported
  by the Syndicate and other groups) sometimes work against him,
  but nobody seriously expects to unseat him without extreme
  measures.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mr. Rifaie certainly knows about McPatric, and has deigned to
  show it (an unexpected honour). This signals that if anything
  happens to McPatric (or if he does anything), Mr. Rifaie will
  know. What he would do is impossible to tell, but it complicates
  things a lot. He might be protecting the trade, or he might send
  a signal to the Brethren of Purity and Balance - or he might be
  interested in keeping the conflicts confused.
  </p>
  <p>
   When McPatric begins to work for the Armorers, the different
  fractions take note. The Scholars of Light and Brethren of Purity
  will be the first to notice things, getting a warning from their
  friends in Alexandria of a large approaching group of western
  mages. They will do their best to learn what is going on, but in
  a discreet manner. If Mme Granboul-Ponty finds out, she will
  start to watch too, planning to use the Armorers. This can lead
  to a very complicated business behind the scenes, as different
  groups try to find out what is going on, prevent each other from
  learning the truth and try to make the Armorers fit into their
  schemes. And Mr. Rifaie might become interested just to make
  things more complicated...
