  <h2>
   Suggested Music
  </h2>
  Arabian music of all kinds, from Sufi
  chants to Arabian pop. Oum Kalsoum and Latifah might be hard to
  get, but are likely worth it..
  <p>
   "Revolution" by Jarre could be the theme music for the
  Ascension Jihad -- Arabian chants against an electronic voice
  surrounded by fast moving electronic music. It is slightly too
  modern to suit the overall mood, but as an occasional theme it
  works.
  </p>
  <p>
   The magic flute by Mozart is ideal for the hermetic parts of
  this chronicle. The storyline subtly reflects parts of the
  chronicle and many of the arias fit in perfectly for the solemn
  hermetic mood, such as "Es lebe Sarastro", "Wenn Tugend und
  Gerechtigkeit", "O Isis und Osiris", "Die Strahlen der Sonne
  vertreiben die Nacht" and "Es siegte die Stärke".
  </p>
  <p>
   If the cabal succeeds, finish the chronicle with the final
  choir of Beethoven's 9th symphony, or possibly the final movement
  of the 5th.

  <h2>
   Suggested Reading
  </h2>
  In general, books about Egyptian
  mythology are useful; there are too many to name. Maps and
  tourist guides to modern Egypt are also useful resources (no
  chronicle should ever be without a map, if only to help the
  players orient themselves).
  <p>
   <i>
    Blue Guide Egypt
   </i>
   , Veronica Seton-Williams and Peter
  Stocks, A&amp; C Black London, WW Norton New York, 1993. Not just
  a tourist guide but a real reference work for everything
  egyptian: history, mythology, flora &amp; fauna, religion,
  architecture, language, practical details, locations (often with
  maps) and background information.
  </p>
  <p>
   <i>
    Focault's Pendulum
   </i>
   by Umberto Eco. Gives a humorus and
  intellectual introduction to the hermetic-conspirative way of
  thinking, including a secret group seeking a goal just as grand
  and profound as the Pattern. A must for all Mage
  Storytellers.
  </p>
  <p>
   <i>
    Egyptian Myths
   </i>
   by George Hart. Contains several of the
  most important myths in a form closer to the original stories
  than the versions commonly found in mythology texts (which have
  been oversimplified and "cleaned up" to become more
  comprehensible for modern people).
  </p>
  <p>
   White Wolf sourcebooks:

  <div class="c1">
   <i>
    The Arcanum
   </i>
   is excellent for this chronicle, both as a
    description of how the cabal might work, and as a potential
    opponent.
   <p>
    <i>
     Destiny's Price
    </i>
    is somewhat relevant for the more
    gritty sides of Egyptian society; while the underworld works
    very differently in Cairo and Alexandria human vice and
    degradation is the same the world across.
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     Mummy
    </i>
    has plenty of information on Egyptian ideas,
    albeit slanted differently than this chronicle.
   </p>
  </div>
  <p>
   <i>
    Secret Societies
   </i>
   for
   <i>
    Nephilim
   </i>
   by Chaosium
  contains plenty of ideas for secret societies stretching back
  from prehistory to the present.
  </p>
  <p>
   <i>
    The Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic
   </i>
   by Israel
  Regardie. A huge tome of rituals, essays and diagrams of modern
  English hermetic magick. Contains several discussions of the
  Egyptian gods from the hermetic point of view. Not for the faint
  hearted.
  </p>

   Other props
  </h2>
  Try serving Arabian coffee and sweet cookies
  to set the mood; spending time discussing and drinking coffee is
  plain courtesy in Egyptian society. To enhance realism, if
  possible consider smoking to produce the real café
  ambience. If you can get a ceiling fan too, go for it!
  <p>
   Incense for the more hermetic and ancient sections.
  </p>
  <p>
   There are plenty of imitation papyri being sold today, with
  suitably "classic" motifs to be usable. In fact, it is very easy
  to find ancient Egyptian objects, ranging from the tacky to
  elegant. Moderation is probably best, but having a figurine on
  the table might be a good way of setting the mood.
