   The followers of Isis are among the most ancient of all mages.
  Isis was not only the goddess of life and magick, she was also
  cunning and subtle in her ways, always using her magick to
  further the goals of herself and her loved ones. There are many
  stories about her cleverness: she tricked Ra himself to reveal
  his true name to her, she helped her son Horus to win the battle
  against Set and she resurrected Osiris with her magicks. The
  priest-mages she trained learned her skills, and when she
  withdrew from the world they continued to serve her and
  themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
   The cult has always sought to survive and prosper using all
  available means, whatever changes occur in the mundane and occult
  world. During the Ptolemies, the Priestesses worked almost
  openly, manipulating events so that they could spread the cult
  into the Roman empire and turn it into one of the largest cults
  (Cleopatra was most probably a member or a high ranking acolyte,
  doing what she could to spread it to Rome and to use Rome to
  further her own goals). Unfortunately their clever ways were
  opposed by other groups, and a war of secrecy began between the
  Priestesses and the growing Celestial Chorus. The Choristers
  found the worship of the goddess reprehensible, and did
  everything they could to suppress it. Slowly the Priestesses were
  driven underground or killed like Hypatia. They put on a great
  fight, mostly to hide that they actually went underground from
  their enemies. Some Priestesses dispersed through the Empire,
  while others remained in secret in Egypt. Although these groups
  have long since lost contact and diverged quite a bit in belief
  and magick, some still exist in secret.
  </p>
  <p>
   Throughout history the Priestesses of Isis have held a low
  profile, always manipulating things behind the scenes or avoiding
  conflict. Instead they have concentrated on preserving the
  ancient rites and mysteries of the Goddess to prepare for the day
  they will again be needed, and to become the power behind the
  thrones of the world just as Isis was the wife and advisor of
  Osiris. They do their best to become the confidantes, lovers or
  spouses of the powerful and initiated. Some of the Priestesses
  have infiltrated the Verbena, but most have kept to themselves.
  Often they masquerade as other traditions (most mages believe
  Hypatia was a member of the Order of Hermes), or hide as mortal
  women.
  </p>
  <p>
   One problem of the Priestesses is that from time and again
  some members become too ambitious and manipulate things too
  obviously. Usually this makes other groups aware of their
  existence, and the remaining priestesses have to hide. The
  politically active priestesses are often quite able to run things
  on their own, but sooner or latter they will fall when they stand
  alone without open support from their sisters. Due to this
  tendency to err on the side of caution the priestesses have
  several times held the reins of power in Egypt, only to lose
  them: Hatshepsut, Cleopatra, Shagar al-Durr. But while their
  queens fall, the priestesses still remain and control things from
  behind the scenes. In fact, they prefer to rule from the harem or
  the whispers of the marketplace rather than from the throne
  room.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Ahl-I-Batin has fought against the machinations of the
  priestesses for over a millennium, but still do not understand
  the whole picture. They believe they have encountered several
  independent conspiracies, some apparently based on splinter
  groups of their own tradition. Little do they suspect that they,
  the master manipulators, have been themselves manipulated.
  </p>
  <p>
   Today the Priestesses watch the events closely, prepared to be
  on the winning side, whichever that is. The priestesses
  dispassionately realise that it doesn't matter if the
  fundamentalists or liberals win in the chorus; what matters is
  that there will be an Egypt left to influence. To this end they
  secretly support the traditions against the Technocracy (although
  they do their best to discreetly infiltrate the highest echelons
  of technocracy allies) and fight the Nephandi. Their current main
  battle is against the Dogs of Shaitan, who has been their eluding
  enemies for many years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the struggle to complete the Plan, the remaining
  Priestesses will watch from their hidingplaces, biding their
  time. Once they realise its true meaning they will begin overt
  assistance, mostly by manipulating other groups. They are more
  intrigued by the possibility of a symbolic marriage between
  Osiris (Philippe) and Isis, one of their own.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Magick
  </h2>
  The Priestesses have adapted with time, and often
  hide their magick in plain sight as jewellery, mysterious powders
  and potions in the boudoir or songs. But the basis remains
  classic Egyptian magick: amulets, true names and invocations of
  the gods. Most of their magick has been formalised into
  traditional "spells" (the spells are somewhat inflexible, but
  subtle and easily cast - a few words, a simple act or a prayer).
  <p>
   The Priestesses are usually best at Life and Mind, being
  rather negative to the use of Entropy, Forces and Time. Some
  enterprising Priestesses have adopted other ways, and use
  Correspondence to learn secrets from afar.

  <h2>
   Laylah Ramadan: the Widow's Daughter
  </h2>
  Laylah was the
  daughter of a prominent politician in Alexandria, living a
  comfortable and happy life in the upper classes. She was closer
  to her poetic and forceful father than to her mother, a discreet
  and polite woman Laylah loved but found far too timid and
  conventional; often they got into long quarrels about what was
  proper and not proper behaviour for a young lady.
  <p>
   Everything was shattered a few years back when her father was
  assassinated by unknown attackers in a drive-by-shooting on his
  way to a meeting. They were actually sent by the Shayks of the
  White Night, who mistakenly thought his policies were his own; in
  reality it was Laylah's mother, a true Priestess of Isis, who
  guided him subtly to their own ends. The grief almost shattered
  Laylah's heart, but her mother comforted her and began to teach
  her some old stories. For the first time Laylah truly listened to
  her, and began to see her true nature: a very intelligent woman
  willing to influence society, but too shy to do it herself. So
  she married Laylah's father hoping to lead him to truth, and
  perhaps even
   <i>
    wanted
   </i>
   Laylah to become as independent,
  quick-tempered and modern as she turned out, despite her tirades
  about proper behaviour.
  </p>
  <p>
   What Laylah never realised was the subtlety of her mother. All
  she told her daughter was completely true, but not the entire
  story. She didn't rule through her husband, she just guided him
  along the path the Priestesses had planned. She deliberately made
  Laylah grow up into a rebel. When her husband died, she turned to
  introducing her daughter into the Priestesses, teaching her old
  stories and giving her new ideas. Instead of forcing her visions
  upon Laylah she just dropped seeds she knew would bloom one
  day.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the other hand, Laylah understands some things her mother
  do not see. She suspects that some of the friends of her mother
  also belong to the same 'clique' of women interested in
  influencing their important husbands or sons in some desirable
  direction. The whole thing strikes Laylah as laughable; a vain
  dream of power for women through seduction and hints. It might
  have worked in the past, but she doubts it: more likely the
  seductresses just deluded themselves into thinking they held the
  power over their men. Today a more open approach is the only
  thing possible: if you want influence, why not just gain it
  openly (or at least without all the "femme fatale" stuff)? She
  has discussed this a bit with some of her friends in the Egyptian
  high society "brat pack", and they seem to agree with her. In
  fact, she is becoming the informal leader of her own clique of
  modern, upbeat and western youngsters. Whose ideas will triumph
  in the end, hers or the ideas of her cautious mother, nobody
  knows.
