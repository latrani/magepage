   Notes on the Mage Tarot
  </h1>

  <p>
   The lizard seen in the Page, Knight and King of Questing is
  probably a salamander, associated with fire.
  </p>
  <p>
   The butterfly in the lap of the King of Dynamism is of course
  the chaos butterfly.
  </p>
  <p>
   The werewolf and dragon on Strength has created a lake of mud
  by their struggle. The inner struggle that the card represents
  can also be destructive.
  </p>
  <p>
   The face in the background of Five of Pattern is the Matriarch
  of MECHA.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Beast (Knight of Primordialism) also corresponds to
  Baphomet, the ever changing manifestation of the Life Force (note
  its association with tantra).
  </p>
  <p>
   The red flag on the Sun card could imply the ideals of
  socialism, that fit in with the meaning of the card:
  collaboration, teamwork, cooperation, organization and shared
  vision.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is interesting to note that Gaia is clothed in a scarf that
  turns into a dragon-snake. In the Rider-Waite deck she is clothed
  in a scarf, while in the Toth deck she stands on a snake. Could
  this be a representation of the Wyrm? Jimmy McKinney pointed out
  that she holds the wand of order (Weaver) and the wand of chaos
  (Wyld), and that her expression may be both pain, disgust,
  indifference or rapture.
  </p>
  <p>
   The four beings around her are the four cherubim, originally a
  babylonian symbol later adopted by Christianity: the eagle is
  Shamash or the Sun (Water); the angel is Sin or the Moon (Air);
  the lion is Mergal or Mars (Fire); and the ox is Mingirsu or
  Saturn) (Earth). They also appear on The Wheel of Fortune.
  [Andrea Bentini]

  <p>
   The comentary for the justice card talks about the "double
  edged sword of justice". The figure in the illustration is an
  Akashic holding a Katana. Katanas only have one edge.... (sound
  of head hitting wall repeatedly). [Shaun Murrant]
  </p>
  <p>
   Death is interesting. The Rose on the curtain of mystery is a
  symbol of silence (and of course Vampire). On the table in front
  of the two people stands the pieces of chess, signifying vampiric
  society or the famous "chessgame against death". The ocean of
  blood behind the curtain is both primordial and a symbold of life
  and the subconscious; in it the ego will dissolve.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Mage has already been analysed, but here is a small
  reiteration: the coke can represents the chalice of water, the
  key fire and the wand, the pistol is air and the dagger and the
  credit cards an excellent symbol of earth. Beneath the table
  there is a tangle of wires, this is the subconscious and the
  secret connections of the world. The HUD display Dante wears
  shows that although the Mage is pure Will, he doesn't see reality
  as it is but as he wants to see it.
  </p>
  <p>
   The woman in the blood (the blood of Gaia or the blood
  spilling from the Klaives?) seems to make the sign for "Perdo
  Ignem", I Destroy Fire. Above her the moon goddess is surrounded
  by five yuds (the Hebrew letter 'I'), symbolizing fire. Maybe
  this corresponds to a denial of sexuality or passion that is
  defated by the urges of the subconscious, or perhaps the way out
  of the swamp (this card is ambivalent, just as the moon).
  </p>
  <p>
   The rose seems to be a general symbol for mystery and secrets
  (Death, Ace of Questing, King of Dynamism, Luna and others) while
  the Lily seems to represent the Yin principle (See especially the
  lovers, where the burning tree is yang and Queen of Dynamism who
  appears to be crowned by them). Sometimes the rose is Yang (like
  in Ace of Questing), but this seems to vary quite a bit.
  Sunflowers of course represents the solar principle, the quest
  for Ascension and the Avatar. Other flowers (as in four of
  Questing and six of Primordialism) seems to represent material
  pleasures, vices and ideas.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Empress is crowned by twelve stars, the same crown as the
  Whore of Babylon in the Book of Revelations. She represents the
  deep secret of sexual magick (cmp. Babalon in Crowleys writings
  and his interpretation of Strength, Lust).
  </p>
  <p>
   Unlike the conventional fool who is stepping into an abyss,
  the Fool in this deck seems to have stepped up on the skycraper
  instead, together with the warning/ironic imp (a Chimera?).
  </p>
  <p>
   The grafitti on the wall beside the Hermit reads: 688
  Noct[urne?], what looks like part of the Hollow One symbol and
  "Mary Lou, Bitch Queen". [Tommy S채채f]
  </p>
  <p>
   The Hermit is traditionally linked to Saturn and time in the
  Tarot, and he held an hourglass. This card may be linked to time
  and its flow, since the Hollow Ones are the newest tradition. The
  figure is taking the duty of the street lamp, but instead of
  lightning the street he direct the light of the torch upward...
  Where? [Andrea Bentini]
  </p>
  <p>
   On the left side of Temperance there is a drawing of a road
  leading between two mountains. This could be the same scene as in
  8 of Primordialism [Tommy S채채f].
  </p>
  <p>
   Is he a guardian of the door or a guide? [ Andrea Bentini]
  </p>
  <p>
   These cards give the following attributions of the traditions:
  Virtual Adepts Mercury, Dreamspeakers the Moon, Verbena Venus,
  Hollow Ones Virgo, Euthanatos Jupiter (!), Cult of Ecstasy
  Gemini, Celestial Chorus Taurus, Akashic Brotherhood Libra, Order
  of Hermes Aries and Sons of Ether Cancer. The Garou correspond to
  Mars, the Kindred to Scorpio, the Wraiths to Capricorn and the
  Changelings to Aether.
  </p>
  <p>
   The symbols of the spheres are often cleverly woven into the
  images. My favorites are two, six, eight and the page of
  Questing, and nine of Primordialism.
