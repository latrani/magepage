   The New World Order in the Bay Area of California

   Author's note: Yet more in the Northern California by Night
  series. This time, a small school, set in the pleasant foothills
  above Stanford. But who knows what the real goal is behind those
  decorative walls. The New World Order is alive and well, even in
  this seemingly free-wheeling region. And they want YOUR
  children.
  </p>
  <hr>
   As intellectual centers go, there are few places that can
  possibly rival the Bay Area of California, in the United States
  or even in the world. Top class research organizations, three
  very prestigious universities, a number of high-class community
  and public colleges, and some of the best private academies money
  can buy make this place the ultimate for those who are shopping
  for the best and brightest for their children.
   <p>
    And for those with the cash, if you child is old enough and
  not graduated from high school, there is the West Hills Academy
  for the Gifted and Talented. If your child can pass the rigorous
  entrance testing, they get access to the best private education
  shy of college. And in the pastoral setting of the hills near
  Portola, just up the ridge from Stanford itself.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Description
   </h2>
   The West Hills Academy, or just The Academy
  as it is known amongst those "in the know", lay on a 20 acre
  preserve in the hills outside of Portola. The grounds are edged
  in a beautiful wrought iron fence, with only the main road
  leading inside and out.
   <p>
    Once inside the compound, there are three clusters of
  buildings, the three Quads. The architecture is simple,
  utilitarian, yet remarkable in its own way. It meets all the
  requirements of form and function, yet blends in well with the
  highly manicured lawns and topiaries that carpet the center of
  campus.
   </p>
   <p>
    The three Quads are devoted to different functions, namely
  Residence, Academy, and Administration. There are subtle
  differences between the three quads, mostly having to do with the
  amount and layout of parking, and the student traffic, but all in
  all they seem very similar.
   </p>
   <p>
    Behind the Academy quad there lies a rather large barn and
  associated stables. There are several trails of into the woods,
  where students can ride or go to get some peace and tranquility
  in the pastoral environs the Academy provides.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Lifestyle
   </h2>
   <blockquote>
    "More than 95% of the student body lives here on campus. This
    way they can take advantage of our around the clock counselling
    services, as well as associate with their peers. Parents are
    always welcome to visit, though they are accomidated
    off-campus. We do not wish to distract students from their
    work."
    <p>
     "The campus environment, as you can see, is well-kept, and
    orderly. This is condusive to the studious environment we wish
    to foster here at the Academy. A strick 9 pm curfew is
    enforced, and no loud music is allowed at any time. There are
    none of the usual distractions that accompany dormitory life:
    no posters, no raucous collections of music or video games. And
    most importantly, no drugs or alcohol. Our students are to be
    kept in control of their own faculties at all times, or they
    are sumarilly dismissed. Any medication is dispensed in the
    campus Infirmary, in the Administration Quad."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Classes are orderly, with maximum student-instructor
    interaction. We pride ourselves on keeping class sizes small,
    so the children get the most of their educational experience.
    Unlike most other schools, we feel that each student is a
    special case, deserving special, individualized attention."

   The reality is exactly that. The lifestyle here is
  restrictive, with a soothing, soft overtone. Light music,
  designed to nulify emotional responses, is played constantly,
  monotonous enough to not be noticed, yet not so monotonous as to
  get boring and stale. Clothing is a school-provided uniform,
  which is washed in the campus laundry at the end of the day.
   <p>
    Were the surroundings less aesthetically pleasing, this place
  would be considered strongly militaristic. Rooms are inspected
  without warning, and strict rules of presentation are held at all
  times. Beds are always made properly, the hair is always combed
  and well-kept, all boookshelves and desk spaces are kept clean.
  It is a paradise for what would be called "anal retentives" in
  the outside world.
   </p>
   <h2>
    The Curriculum
   </h2>
   <blockquote>
    "Here academic aexcellence is not merely registered based upon
    IQ or examination. Students are constantly evaluated by a
    number of criteria, including problem solving, observational
    skills, reasoning, and communication. No student need fear
    expulsion because of bad materials or an inability to
    comprehend an instructor. Sometimes they need to be exposed to
    the material in a different way in order to understand it and
    succeed."
    <p>
     "In the eyes of our administration, education is also not
    mere rote memorization of facts, nor is it a slaving obedience
    to the "three R's". Here we teach focus on the more important
    goals of communication, ethics, deductive reasoning, and
    observation. The creative impulse is stoked from an ember to a
    flame, and tempered by the strong, quick mind the students
    possess."
    </p>
    <p>
     "But education is not simply about the head, either. There
    are extensive physical training facilities available, and
    students must also meet certain physical requirements. Unlike
    what some of our detractors say, this is not a PT test
    reminiscent of military boot camps. Indeed, this is a way to
    encourage a breadth of education and experience in the student
    body. With such courses as horseback riding, hiking, scuba
    diving, marksmanship, and martial arts, we think that any
    student will find what he or she needs to become fit in body as
    well as in mind."
    </p>
    <p>
     "We also do student body counselling, preparing them for the
    world of higher education and the workplace. All our older
    students are involved with local corporations or the local
    government, getting first-hand knowledge and experience that is
    not provided by most other learning institutions, private or
    public."
    </p>

    Academy for the Gifted and Talented":

   </blockquote>
   Indeed, the curriculum is very well-rounded.
  Students spend up to 14 hours a day in classes, with only small
  breaks for snacks and study groups. They are trained to think in
  certain ways, though some of them benefit from this kind of
  training, becoming positively brilliant.
   <p>
    The "focussing" of the creative impulse actually deadens the
  Avatar to all but a Technocratic Awakening, and several promising
  children have been lost after spending a year or two in the
  Academy. In the Academy's entire history, only one student has
  gone Marauder, and the few that have Awakened and accepted the
  Traditions have eventually become quite good spies and
  informants.
   </p>
   <p>
    The physical reigmen, as well, helps train potential
  operatives. For those who show aptitude, the training is as good
  as that provided at other NWO centers, or maybe even a little
  better. THe graduates of the Academy are often placed into
  positions as important operatives, assassins, or spies.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Admissions
   </h2>
   Any student (who can pay the money) is welcome
  to take the test for admissions into the Academy. Those
  remarkable individuals who take the entrance examination may even
  be offered financial aid or scholarships to attend the Academy.
  After all, excellence in education should not be a sole right of
  the wealthy and influential.
   <p>
    In fact, any student that shows potential as a New World Order
  operative is welcome, and in fact pursued. Those that show
  potential to be Awakened will be brought into the Academy at any
  cost, in some cases even through kidnapping. Given the
  prestigious nature of the Academy, however, this last has not yet
  been necessary.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Special Education
   </h2>
   The most remarkable students are
  trained to become operatives for the New World Order at a young
  age. They go through rigorous training, including physical and
  mental regimes, and eventually some of them are even Awakened, to
  become an elite corps of operatives. They are taught
  psychological operations and infiltratin techniques, and are
  encouraged to evaluate and recruit other potential members.
   <p>
    Many of the students at the faculty will become members of
  major corporations, inheriting their positions from wealthy
  parents. They are encouraged to repot to the "authorities"
  anything strange happening and any "seditious" activities.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Problem Cases
   </h2>
   As with any other schools, there are always
  children who don't belong in this one. THeir method of dealing
  with them, however, is novel, and considered by even some in the
  New World Order as barbaric.
   <p>
    If they discover that they mis-assessed a student early on,
  the student will be quietly expelled, and tuition reimbursed.
  They will give the parent the names of several schools that may
  be better fitted for their child's need (all of them run or
  partially run by the NWO), and offer them their condolences.
   </p>
   <p>
    Slightly more advanced cases, or those who have strong
  potential, are immediately hit with a barrage of drug and
  conditioning treatments to "cure" them of their deviance. In this
  way, 99% of the remaining non-expelled cases are made usable to
  the Order's purposes.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the case of those resistant to the drugs or deemed to know
  too much, an "accident" is arranged. A diving board breaks, a
  horse throws its rider, or a gun jams on the rifelry range. There
  are many things that can go wrong, and the school pays enough
  insurance to shut the mouths of the most distraught parents.
  Fortunately the number of accidents such as these at the Academy
  is quite low.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the case of potentially dangerous "moles", there is a
  contingency plan. These operatives may be considered too valuable
  to liquidate, but too dangerous tokeep around. As such, they face
  one of two fates. The first of these is a "deep cover" plan,
  where the mind is almost totally wiped and replaced with a cover
  personality, with the operative's trained persoona to emerge at a
  future time when a command phrase is spoken.
   </p>
   <p>
    The other is more insidious, and considered dangerous by many
  thers of the Technocracy. The operative is given some kind of
  "high-risk" duty, be it service on a Voidjammer or infiltration
  into a secretive sect of Euthanatos or Verbeena. In some cases,
  information is purposefully "leaked" as to the operative's true
  identity. If they survive their mission, they are then
  reconditioned and welcomed back into the Corps. If they fail, the
  blood is on the hands of the enemies of the Order of Reason, and
  not on the New World Order.
