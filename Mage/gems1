This is the first draft of something that I have been working on. Feedback
would be appreciated. I will update it as I get feedback to it.

I wanted to experiment with a project that could show how something
designed at differing power levels could allow for the same devices to be
used very differently. Such is the case with these Passion Gems.

Did you like them?
Do you think you could use them?
Is there enough background for you?
Does it need more background?
Any notes and comments cut from the text would be nice if you can spare the
time.

GEMS OF POWER: First in a Series
PASSION GEMS vers. 1.0
created by Thaddeus Howze ©1995
-----------------------------------------------

Since the dawn of time, man has been fascinated with gems, jewels and
precious stones. Magi were not proof against such fascination and as a
matter of course, use precious stones in the creation of talismans and
artefacts. One such set of stones were known as Passion Gems and were
created by a pussiant Enchanter,  Divinor Mind-Seer.

It is said, she created some of these jewels for her retainers and
apprentices to better serve her. Others she created for her enemies, to
better vex them. And a few she created only for himself, to better wield
her power, more surgically, with less stress and effort. Starting when she
was an apprentice, she made several sets of these jewels during her career.
Other magi, seeing them and pleased with the results, attempted to emulate
her success.

Divinor was often questioned about her placement of single emotional states
within these gems and her response was to ensure that she could be able to
counter their use if they should fall into the wrong hands. The other
reason was they were easier to create if they did not have to run the
entire emotional gamut. There are rumors that he created stones that had
multiple emotional states or ranges but there is no proof to the contrary.

PASSION GEMS: Hidden Gifts (Mind 2, Prime 3)
-----------------------------------------------
These jewels would be designed to be worn as close-fitting jewelry and
would have the added benefit of having a coincidental effect that would be
completely unnoticable. The would have no effect on anyone other than the
wearer. The effect will last as long as the jewel is worn.

A wearer, may exert a willpower point to resist the effects of a gem for 1
scene. These magical effects allow the wearers or users to resist other
mind magics that may attempt to effect their altered state. Use the Arete
rating in dice to roll for countermagic against changing their altered
emotional state. Any normal condition that may cause a change in emotional
state, forces the device to attempt to reapply the emotion magic.

This device recharges itself slowly, and constantly, from a primal
connection established during its creation. This device does not use
quintessence in the normal sense. As a result, it may not reduce its
difficulty to control emotions which are always at a difficulty of 6.

Ex: A chamberlain with an Envy/Greed stone on a necklace is confronted with
a chance to steal a coveted tome of Law. The ST rolls 3 dice and if there
are any successes, the chamberlain will attempt to as quietly and as
inconspicuously as possible attempt to gain the Tome. If the chamberlain is
frightened by a HIT MARK that was hiding in the shadows, the ST rolls again
to see if the chamberlain would forget his envy and greed and run for his
life.

PASSION GEMS: Radiant Passions (Mind 3, Prime 4)
-----------------------------------------------
These jewels have a radiant area that affects everyone within the scene,
including the holder or wearer. Such an effect could be overcome if the
mage had his own mind-magic or countermagical capabilities. It could also
be overcome with a stone that had an opposing power. The stone's affects
would only be active in the presence of the stone. Such a stone might be
worn by a leader or warrior who needed his troops in a certain mindset, or
to demoralize or terrify the enemy.

These jewels were made with Prime (4) so that they never need to be
energized in any way and could continously output their emotion modifying
magic in a area. They would simply work in the presence of the right
circumstances or with the proper control phase or gesture. It pleased
Divinor to create several of these gems without any proper controls to see
how they are used by enterprising magi.

Examples of how such gems were used and mounted:
Increase moral for warriors with the gem embedded in a sword pommel.
Fear and cowardice with the gem hidden in the moneypouch of an enemy leader.
Apathy in the staff of a senator, placed in a piece of office sculpture.

PASSION GEMS: Chamberlain's Keys (Mind 4, Prime 4)
-----------------------------------------------
With Mind 4 used in their creation, the possessor now has the option of
causing the emotional state of the jewel in a target creature or creatures.
This effect will last as long as the Passion jewel remains in the presence
of the targets. This effect will counter any other emotional state except
for one directly opposing the power of the jewel. Given to desired
retainers for controlling underlings or to special agents in his employ to
sow dissent. With 2 successes the emotion created will last one scene; with
3 successes, a day against a difficulty of 6.

This device is usually bound to a ring, sword, pendant or broach.

PASSION GEMS: Sword of the Seneschal (Mind 5, Prime 5)
-----------------------------------------------
These most powerful Passion Gems are found only in the hands of the most
powerful and dangerous of magi and their servants. At Mind 5, the passion
gems can completely overcome the will of the subject. With 2 successes the
emotion created will last one scene; with 3 successes, a day; 4 successes,
a week against a difficulty of 6.

This emotional state will overcome all other emotions and can only be
reduced with the expenditure of a willpower point to temporarily delay the
effect for one scene.(In the case of a single scene, it is just delayed, it
will take effect next scene.) In the Mind 5 jewel, there is a powerful
flaw, if a subject, proves immune,(no successes are made), the subject is
completely immune to this jewel and can never be subject to its power ever
again. No one is sure why this takes place and can only subscribe it to a
flaw in the spell design.

This device is usually worn in a ring or crown. It can sometimes be found
bound to a scepter or staff. Any device of rulership can be used as a base
for this gem.

This is an addenda that I created to create self-powered talismans and
artifacts. I do not think they will unbalance the game unduly. I wrote
these to be used with the Gems of Power Series (q.v.) that I am writing.
These effects are counted as powers for Prime for the creation of talismans
and artifacts.

-----------------------------------------------
Addenda to Prime for Talismans
created by Thaddeus Howze ©1995
-----------------------------------------------

Prime 1:
Needed to hold any extra quintessence

Prime 2:
Limited uses with slow recharge -
This device may recharge by a set standard time such as 6 hours, 24 hours,
or 1 month. This period can be set when the device is created. It usually
means that the power cannot be used after a set number of uses without
allowing the device to recharge. As a example a device may have a limited
number of uses that once used, cannot be used again until the period has
elapsed. This is a way of creating low powered magic with a major
limitation of charges.

Prime 3:
Continously powered magic -
This device runs continuously with no need to recharge but it cannot get
reduced difficulty rolls using the device's internal quintessence store.
This device does not have an internal quintessence storage area. This will
power any magic set up to run continuously. At least one success per scene
is required. If the device achieves 3 successes it will run nonstop for one
day. If the flow of the device is interrupted, it will attempt to restart
its magic in the next scene or as soon as possible. The mage may still use
his personal quintessence to reduce difficulty rolls.

Prime 4:
Continously output magic -
This device is able to output a higher level of magick than Level 3. This
is required to perform magick that has an area effect or multiple targets
capable of being affected. A conduit to the primal quintessence pool is
opened and any active magick is able to be continously run without use of
quintessence. No reduced difficulty rolls are possible, using device's
quintessence since none is actually available to be used. The mage may
still use personal quintessence to reduce difficulty rolls.

Prime 5:
Completely self-powered and recharging -
This is a self-powered artifact that is able to be wielded by non-magi.
This device will recharge itself at a rate of 1 point of quintessence per
day. This device will be able to hold a maximum of 25 quintessence points,
that are accessable by the wielder of the device. If the device has any
continous powers, magick or effects, they will run completely independently
of any internal quintessence. This artifact will also be able to use its
internal quintessence to reduce any difficulty rolls, but only in the hands
of a magus, non magi cannot reduce their difficulties.
