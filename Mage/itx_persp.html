    Author's Note: What follows is another view of the Iteration X
  perspective on things, like spheres, and supernatural
  effects...it may be very different from what one expects - but
  that's the point, because a lot of what has been written about
  this Convention has been, in my opinion, poorly done.

        First big step here: You don't use it.
        <br>
         <br>
          Repeat that: You don't use magick.
          <br>
           <br>
            That's good. Now...there is magick, but I'll cover that when I
  get to discussing the Traditions and such. Iteration X members
  never use magick. They are well-equipped with high technology
  items and built-in cyberware. Unfortunately, to appease the game
  rules, these things must be quantified in terms of the
  Sphere-based Magick system. An explanation, then, of just what
  each Sphere represents will follow...but first:
            <br>
             <br>
              One final note (extension of "First Big Step"): You NEVER use
  Vulgar magick, because you don't use magick. Keep that in mind.
  You aren't "restricting yourself" or anything like that - you use
  cyberware and external tech. Thus - no vulgar magick, even if it
  could save your life - you don't do magick.

  about "Spheres" of "Magick" when they operate. I have split the

                        This is based upon a very powerful expert system implanted within
  the processing unit. It is capable of calculating patterns and
  probabilities in heinously complex systems (Entropy •). As
  complexity increases, the expert system tells the user how to
  effect the system - little things...like flipping a card or two
  around in that deck, or barely distracting the shuffler at the
  proper moment (Entropy ••). At higher levels, this
  system becomes more active, releasing minor amounts of stored
  energy and manipulating ther energy with very low-power fields to
  produce a cornucopia of seemingly random effects. This is a
  complex and expensive system, so the distribution among Iteration
  members is not so high.

                           At the basic level, this is a full scanning package, covering
  electromagnetics (and its constituent parts), gravitics,
  kinetics, quantum energies, and so on. It is built into all of
  the user, and is very effective. Electromagnetic, magnet, and
  electrical devices can be built in as well. Personal lasers can
  be added, as can full holographic projection systems. Electrical
  field projection is easily handled, as is magnetic (many
  Iteration X members have a built-in series of high-powered
  electromagnets, and can manipulate/create many fields around
  themselves). The most advanced items cover gravitics, kinetics,
  and subtle energy systems. The first and third are subject to
  internal controller/generator systems (same idea as the prior
  field systems). There is no "kinetic system." Specific devices
  cover some aspects of this - most are based on accelerating
  matter. Note that many of the standard Mage's Forces effects are
  not possible with Iteration X systems...flight, as a kinetic
  effect is not possible, though gravitic release is available for
  levitation. The user can walk on water - but only if she is
  wearing boots specifically designed to increase the bond energies
  below her (a complex multi-spectra operation).

                              The lifesystem is another expert system, with additional
  components. At its most basic level, it is a diagnostic. The user
  will have built-in sample sights, able to retrieve tissue samples
  from targets. Note that the lifesystem can do some things without
  samples - many diagnoses can be made from sensory cues, such as
  respiration, listening to heart beat, looking at subject, and so
  on. For in-depth analysis, a sample is required. Of course, any
  necessary genetic work can be done with the help of the Iteration
  X system, which is easily accessible when needed. The core of all
  higher-level lifesystem operations is nanites. The nanite system
  is a large neural net gestalt system of molecule-sized robots. It
  has replication/creation sites for more nanites (since violence
  and outside work can reduce the overall number). Any operation in
  another living system requires the exuding of nanites - thus, the
  user must be reasonably close to its target, usually touching.
  Note that with proper materials (Carbon is the most important)
  the nanites can be exuded into raw material and create a living
  system, though this takes time. The Transmutation nanite package
  is suggested as an important "helper" package for use with the
  Lifesystem.

                                 The basic matter-scanning system uses spectro-analysis to
  determine composition of matter (it has scanner systems in the
  user's eyes). It also employs special high-power EM beams and
  ultrasonics to determine density of an item, and possible inner
  permutations. The actual manipulation of matter is done by
  another nanite system, similar to the Lifesystem. The
  Transmutation nanites are able to restructure matter, and even,
  with the use of low-power dedicated electromagnetic/gravitic
  systems, change the atoms themselves. Note that the Transmutation
  system cannot make matter do impossible things...thus, an
  Iteration X user cannot make an object's boiling point change any
  more than its environment can make it change. However, the
  Transmutation system also has access to the full group of
  Iteration-discovered elements, up to atomic number 122. Many of
  these have unique properties (which can be extrapolated from
  their position on the periodic table) which prove useful...of
  course, many are also highly unstable. Note that even when you

  turns (though one can speed the process at the expense of
  exactitude).

                             Eventually, most Iteration X members will have their CPU
  upgraded. The current top-of-the-line model can cut out mental
  processes in the user, multitask, enable total recall, and other
  mental feats. Once the initial CPU add-on is in place, then the
  other systems can be added. These include ultrasensitive
  electromagnetic field scanners, capable of tracking the activity
  of nearby brains/neural systems. That, along with a special
  expert system that tracks body language and non-voluntary
  responses, can be used to extrapolate mood and even thoughts of a
  target. The highest-level system is even capable of powerful
  electromagnetic manipulations - certain parts of the brain can be
  "poked" to elicit responses. Emotions are easily done, but
  certain thoughts can be implanted - the addition of pheromone
  exuding assemblies helps in this. Note that Mind 5 is not a part
  of any Iteration X mental systems, except for the fact that a
  person's engram can be downloaded into a computer system - this
  requires Mind 5 for the engram to be able to become an operating
  intelligence within the computer.

                             Many of the systems used by Iteration X members are
  energy-intensive. For that reason, there is a whole system of
  sub-assemblies devoted to absorbing free energy from the
  environment (heat sinks, and so on). Additionally, the user will
  have high-capacity energy storage systems implanted to keep all
  of this energy (note that many Iteration members have batteries
  [see below] but only some of them, the ones with the highest
  energy demands, have the energy collection and use systems). In
  addition to the collectors, energy converters and directors are
  included, allowing the user to recharge other systems, including
  the batteries of other Iteration members. A user must be near the
  area to be affected (depletion or addition) to use the energy
  systems. "Aggressive" energy-sinking can be consciously used to
  detrimental effect on other systems, including even organic
  systems.

                                There has been some experimentation with personal version of
  Void-Engineer "jump" or "hyperdrive" systems. While these
  concepts seem nonscientific and possibly magick-related to
  Iteration X, they have experimented with "Hypermodules" in some
  of their operatives. A user with a hypermodule has full access to
  space-bending technology, and can extend their sensing/tracking
  systems over great distance, as well as "jumping" from place to
  place. Note that even with a Hypermodule, a user cannot be in
  more than one place at a time and cannot take more than about
  twice their own mass to another location. This module is only
  used due to current need, and may soon be taken out of use.

                                   The concept of a spirit world is one that Iteration X knows holds
  a primary place in the destructive attempt by the Traditions and
  others to make a new reality. It is only the flooding in of these
  forces that allows for magick at all. Unfortunately, the
  Gauntlet, a once-weakened, now stronger, natural barrier is still
  not sufficiently restored to keep other dimensions from flooding
  in on occasion. It is for this purpose that a few well-trusted
  operatives are given Spirit upgrades. These expert systems
  operate with special, other-dimensional materials to let the user
  "deal" with spirits. Note that there are very few of these in
  existence, as the materials used for the actual upgrades is
  dangerous to the natural barrier that walls this reality.
  Iteration X knows and understands the dangers of letting the
  Gauntlet fall, as the physics of other dimensions are, perhaps
  logically, unlike ours, and interaction poses an enormous danger
  to humanity.

                                      Another item based on possibly corrupt Void-Engineer devices, the
  Warpmodule is similar to the Hypermodule. It allows the "warping"
  of time, slowing it or speeding it up in certain areas. It also
  allows the halting of time advance, for a while, in some areas.
  There have been shown, experimentally, to be bad side effects in
  terms of energy build-up and release when this is used. This
  module is almost never allowed to Iteration members - usually, it
  is added as a defensive measure against Tradition mages, since it
  can counteract their dramatic Time magicks. Note that time
  sensing is not allowed by the Warpmodule - only manipulation.

  other errors made by the complex expert systems that keep
  Iteration members running. For instance - the Iteration member
  engages his Gravitics to ditch a potentially nasty brawl in an

  system made a slight error in power allocation, and the user
  suffers a nasty fluttering of his visual systems as the
  regulators try to even it out (a one point flaw).

                                    This is one solid group because the same is true of all of them -
  they are organisms corrupted/damage by the influx of
  other-dimensional creatures or energies through the faulty
  Gauntlet. They themselves try to damage the Gauntlet - perhaps as
  a result of "possession" (subconscious coercion) by
  other-dimensional beings. They should be studied, cleansed if
  possible, and purged if not.

  at other times in the past, strange combinations of creatures
  were forged, but only the weres bred true. They are, however, an
  unnatural addition to the ecosystem, as damaging as rabbits in
  Australia. The Convention kills them at every opportunity.

                                                The debate still rages in the Iteration X system about Vampires.
  It is still not known whether they are a facet of the dimensional
  bleed, or a biological occurrence. Not enough information has
  been gathered to indicate which is true. One faction believes
  they are, in a way, the Iteration ideal - life carried into
  machinery - as they change from a normal organic creature to one
  that is clinically dead. Vampires hold a unique status - killing
  is to be avoided where possible, and extensive study is the
  imperative for all members.

                                                    supposed to be how Iteration X "justifies" it's
  use of magick. They
                                                    <br>
                                                     are not using magick. True, their high-science would have been
  well-nigh impossible in years past, but that does not mean they
  are so shallow as in the books - they don't make up technobabble
  to "explain away" magick - they have nothing to explain. If you
  can play them and see them with that attitude, I think I have
  succeeded a bit in making my point to you.
