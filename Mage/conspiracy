Subject: Re: Conspiracies

>From Kevin Mowrey:

 This is a little something I've been working on, still in a very
rough form.  It was initially inspired by the Arcadia Moon-trod conspiracy
ideas of Erik Dahl on Changeling-l, although I've left most of that out
for the time being.
 White Wolf has long put various supernatural agencies behind major
world events and conspiracies, often without bothering to link them
together very much.  What I've done is take a number of "real-world"
conspiracies, groups, and events and link them together via the World of
Darkness background.  Doing this meant that I ended up using events and
groups which some people may find upsetting, and putting them in a
conspiratorial game context.  If something in this offends you, rest
assured it wasn't meant to--I am not trying to make light of any of the
horrors of the real world.
 I've also left out a number of juicy conspiracies, because I
couldn't find a place for them--or they didn't link up directly.  And
while there are many great political assassination conspiracies, I only
touch lightly on them in reference to another conspiracy.  I encourage
storytellers to do their own research and try to fathom the murky depths
of motivation.
 I'd also urge storytellers to buy _The Big Book of Conspiracies_
by Doug Moench.  It does a good job of summing up lots of conspiracy
theories and cross-referencing them.  And it's pretty cheap, really.
 So without further ado, the tangled web of WoD conspiracies (and I
know that some of this likely violates WW canon).

THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON
 The Temple of Solomon, one of the holiest of sites, was built by
laborers whose secret wisdom the Freemasons claim to have inherited.  The
Temple was a symbol of the Jewish faith, and a place of worship.
 Jewish magicians, known as Kabbalists (or Qabbalists, or any of a
number of spellings), have strong links to the Order of Hermes, as do the
Freemasons themselves.
 During the Crusades, the Knights of the Temple, or Templars, were
named after the Temple of Solomon.  Readers interested in this aspect
of the Templars are directed to _The Occult Conspiracy_.
 In addition, on the former site of the Temple of Solomon now
stands the Dome of the Rock, a holy site of the Muslim faith.  The
Assassins (or hashishim) were a fanatical sect of the Muslims, with links
to the Assamites.  The Muslims themselves had links to the tradition of
Mages known as the Ahl i Batin.

THE COUNCIL OF NICAEA
 In 300 AD, a council of Christian elders met and compiled what is
known as the Bible today.  In addition to the Torah, influences from all
over, including Greek philosophy, were included.  A number of things were
left out because they did not fit with the elders' ideas.
 It's very likely that this was the work of the Celestial Chorus,
or a proto-Chorus, attempting to fit their own philosophy of ascension
into the still-new religion.

THE TEMPLARS
 The Templars were an order of holy knights created by the Church
during the time of the Crusades.  It is from the Templars and other
knightly orders of the time that the concept of the professional soldier
springs.  During their time in the middle east, the Templars had contact
with both the Jews of the region and the Muslims, including the Assassins.
 From their contacts, the Templars grew to be a 'church within the
church', handling their own banking, revoking excommunications issued by
bishops, and answerable only to the Pope.  They were later branded
heretics and supposedly destroyed, on the face of it because the King of
France wanted to get his hands on their wealth and bishops were angry at
the power of the order.
 In fact, while both of these factors contributed to the supposed
end of the Templars, it was ultimately the work of the Celestial Chorus. 
The Chorus had originally created the order to help force Christianity on
the Holy Land.  In the course of their duties, the Templars came into
contact with the Kabbalists and Ahl i Batin who introduced them to the
Gnostic philosophies that were later branded 'demon-worship' by the Church
(and the Chorus).
 The remnants of the Templars ended up in the Freemasons,
particularly the Scots Rites Masons.  During the time that the Templars
were being exterminated, Robert the Bruce of Scotland was under
excommunication and therefore not subject to Church law.

THE FREEMASONS
 The Freemasons have a long history of dealing with the
supernatural forces of the World of Darkness.  They are also notable for
being a major force behind the United States government (many of the
movers and shakers of the past and present had Masonic links) and the
French Revolution (again, interested readers are referred to _The Occult
Conspiracy_).
 Many of the Ancient Illuminated Seers of Bavaria (the AISB) also
fled into Freemasonry when their order was abolished.  The Templars still
have a strong influence in the Masons--the junior order is known as
DeMolay, after the leader of the Templars who was burned at the stake for
heresy!

THE AISB
 The Ancient Illuminated Seers of Bavaria was established in the
18th century by Adam Weishaupt.  Weishaupt had either been a Jesuit, or
was Jesuit-educated (depending on the history you read).  At the time, the
Jesuits were out of favor with the Catholic Church.  Weishaupt created a
secret society (the AISB) with the stated goal of the abolition of
organized religion and the establishment of a world government based on
principles of reason.
 This sounds very much like a goal created by the Technocracy.  In fact,
the influence of the New World Order can be seen in the recruiting
practices of the AISB.  They would observe candidates and test them, all
without the candidate's knowledge.  If the candidate was deemed worthy, he
would be initiated; if he wasn't he would never know the AISB had been
interested in him at all.
 In addition to the NWO, the AISB had strong Masonic links, and
therefore links to the Templars, who would likely have enjoyed working
against the Celestial Chorus.
 The Tremere have at times been described as 'The Illuminati'
because of their structure, and possibly a close relationship to the AISB,
also known in short form as 'The Illuminati'.  The term only means
'Enlightened Ones' or 'Illuminated Ones'.  While the Tremere may be the
Illuminati, they were not the AISB.
 It is rumored that after the AISB was outlawed, Adam Weishaupt
fled to America, taking the place of George Washington.  The two men did
have a remarkable physical similarity.  The symbol of the AISB, the eye in
the pyramid, appears on the one dollar bill.  It was also prominent in
French revolutionary literature.
 
THE NAZIS
 The Nazis had numerable occult links.  In addition to the Get of
Fenris, the Nazis were under the control of the Progenitors (who were
breeding the Master Race) and renegade Sons of Ether, drawn to the Nazis
by the degree to which the Nazis would support scientific advancement
without worrying about ethics or loss of life.
 In fact, while the Get would like people to believe that they
opposed the Nazis for the most part because of their cowardly tactics in
exterminating the Jews, it is likely that they left when they uncovered
the extent to which the Nazis were involved with Magi.  Many of the
European Get of the time were probably still raised with the idea that
honor is reserved for fellow gentlemen--just as there is no dishonorable
way to kill the Wyrm, they would probably not see a dishonorable way to
kill those humans they felt were Wyrm-spawn.
 The Holocaust itself was a plot to kill the Jews and Gypsies, both
groups with strong occult ties--ties which were not with the Technocracy. 
It also served as a cover for Progenitor experimentation (see ALIENS, below).

THE CIA
 The CIA grew out of the OSS (Office of State Security), which was
created during the Second World War.  During the war, Allen Dulles, a
member of OSS, developed links to many Nazis, including Wehrmacht Colonel
Reinhard Gehlen.
 At the end of the war, Gehlen made copies of all the information
the Nazis had on the USSR and created the espionage organization ORG in
Switzerland.  Dulles worked with ORG while creating the CIA.
 The CIA was also involved with Project: Paperclip, which obscured
the Nazi affiliation of many German scientists to bring them to America
after the war.  Many of these scientists ended up in the American speace
program.
 Allen Dulles was fired by John F. Kennedy, and later served on the
Warren Commission, which found that the Kennedy assassination was the work
of one man.

MIND CONTROL
 The leader of the Assassins used hashish to whip his followers
into an ecstacy of religious fervor, supposedly showing them the delights
of heaven.  Assured that they would be able to return to heaven for acts
of murder, he thus insured their loyalty.
 The Nazis also attempted to find ways to induce chemical mind
control, under the guise of creating drugs for aviators.
 The highpoint in the history of chemical mind control came when
the CIA initiated MK-ULTRA, which tested the mind-controlling effects of
LSD on CIA agents, military personnel, and ordinary US citizens.
 In many of the political assassinations of the modern day, the
perpetrators have been described as glassy-eyed and in trance-like states.
Lee Harvey Oswald served at one of the few military bases in which LSD was
tested on the troops.

CLONING
 The company at the forefront of cloning technology in the World of
Darkness, DNA, is a front for the progenitors.  DNA is also of note for
their interest in the Garou.
 From a conspiratorial point of view, there are reports of numerous
Oswald look-alikes in the vicinity of Dallas during the Kenneday
assassination.  Kerry Thornley, future author of _Principia Discordia_,
claims that Oswald, who was a personal friend of his in the Marine Corps,
was a breeding experiment.

THE MOON LANDING
 When astronauts landed on the moon in 1969, inadvertently opened
the gateway to Arcadia.  It was at this point that the Void Engineers, who
were behind the moon landing came under the scrutiny of the rest of the
Technocracy for possibly being under the influence of the fae.
 Reports that the moon landing was faked were accurate, in that a
mock moon landing was filmed to cover up the opening of the Arcadia
Moon-trod.  Later a device was exploded on the moon to close the
moon-trod.  This was gone over at much greater length by Erik T. Dahl on
Changeling-l.  I'd advise the interested to check on there.

ALIENS
 The era of the modern UFO started in 1947 when pilot Kenneth
Arnold saw 9 crescent-shaped objects skipping through the air like saucers
over water (hence the 'flying saucer' appellation) over Washington's
Cascade Mountains.
 1947 was also the year of the Roswell crash, the events of which
are familiar to most conspiracy buffs and therefore do not need further
elaboration.
 These and similar sightings resulted in the creation of Project:
Grudge, later changed to Project: Bluebook.  The overt purpose of the
Project was to investigate UFO sightings.  The covert purpose of the
Project was to discredit and discourage anyone claiming to have seen UFOs.
Both of these were obviously front operations for the NWO, concerned with
the secrecy of the project.  The apocryphal Majestic-12 group is the true
NWO operation.  Majestic-12 (MJ-12) currently operates out of Area 51.
 It is known that the Nazis worked on flying disk technology in
World War Two, but were unable to make it work.  The Nazi scientists,
including the renegade Sons of Ether responsible for the flying disks were
later brought to America where they continued their work.
 The 'Greys', the standard grey-skinned, big-eyed aliens of the
modern era, are in fact, humans genetically engineered into forms more
suited to space travel.  This work was begun by the Progenitors during
World War II with prisoners from the Nazi death camps.
 The purpose of the Greys and the flying disks was not only to
explore space, but to prepare humanity for the idea of alien races, in
accordance with the mission of the Void Engineers to change consensual
reality in such a way that umbral spirits became more scientific creatures
from space.
 Alien abductions may be the work of the Technocracy, although it
has been rumored that the Greys are rebelling against their masters.  With
the advanced technology on the flying disks (and the capacity for Umbral
travel that the disks have), as well as the inside knowledge of
Technocracy dealings, the Greys could prove a serious threat to the
Technocracy should they defect.

 That's all I have right now.  I'm currently thinking of the Greys
as being essentially like humans, but with typically lower STR and STA,
and higher DEX.  They probably have a genetic predisposition to Psychic
Numina, although I doubt the Progenitors would have allowed them to
develop full-blown Avatars.  Consider them Awakened for all practical
purposes, though unable to learn Sphere Magick.
 Full Greys would have a 0 APP, although since they're still
genetically human, crossbreeding is possible.  Crossbreeds would have
standard human stats, unusual features (though not necessarily
unattractive), and a predisposition for Psychic Numina.  They'd also have
full-blown Avatars (and as such be capable of Awakening).
