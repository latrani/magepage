Frostegalder (Life 1) <Asatru> 
------------------------------
By singing this song, the mage is protected from cold
and freezing. The mage sings the galder to his flesh and
limbs, making them liven up and get warm again. 


Follow Blood (Life 1 Time 2) <Order of the Eternal Dawn>
--------------------------------------------------------
The mage touches some blood from someone. The result is
that the mage gains physiological knowledge about the
owner, his age, condition, appearance, sicknesses,
markings and so on. By tracing the blood backwards, the
mage can learn how the owner was when he was younger.
The mage may also continue the tracing back to the
owners parents, and their parents, and so on. A single
trait may be followed back to its source. 


Heritage of the Blood (Life 1 Time 2) <Asatru>
----------------------------------------------
In ancient time, the god Heimdallr travelled the land,
and sired the thralls, the bards, the farmers and the
jarls (the leaders). The trace of the god is still upon
the people, and a asapriest knowledgeable in the ways of
the blood can still see it. By feeling the force in the
blood, the mage can follow the lineage back through time
to its source, and see which group someone really
belongs to. This is also used to trace the lineages, and
find those special bloodlines which contain the life of
the people. 


Song of Life (Life 1 Spirit 2) <Dreamspeakers>
----------------------------------------------
Dreamspeakers often contact the spirits of nature. They
seek to awaken the spirits around themselves by dancing,
drumming and singing ancient songs. If they are lucky
they might contact the spirits around them. Most nature
spirits are weak beings, but sometimes they meld
together into one powerful spiritus loci, which can have
great power. However, most spirits are just conscious of
what happens in their own world, and very bad at
recognising other activities. On the other hand nature
spirits are very good at revealing where different
plants grow, if somebody has passed or forecast the
weather. 


Blessing of Baphomet (Life 2)
-----------------------------
All kinds of life in the vicinity of the mage start to
grow and multiply faster. Flowers bloom, crops become
bountiful, all female beings become fertile. A place
where this rote has been used often sometimes looks like
a jungle, filled with wines and insects. 


Ignore Pain (Life 2 Mind 1)
---------------------------
Verbena sometimes turn off their own pain. Using this
rote the mage feels no pain, regardless of how wounded
she is. This is both good and bad , especially since the
mage cannot easily tell how hurt she is, which can be
rather dangerous. Verbena use to perform this rote by
ritually cut themselves in a spiral pattern. At the
start of the cut it hurts, but then it feels less and
less and in the end nothing at all. 
[The mage will not get any penalties for wounds down to
his stamina number of wound boxes (after that the damage
is so severe it causes practical hinders for the mage
despite the absence of pain). To find out how hurt the
mage is if the situation isn't obvious (like with an
arrow in the back), use perception + alertness with a
difficulty of 6.]


Lust (Mind 2 Life 2)
--------------------
This rote is used by the Verbena to fill their victims
with unquenchable sexual desires, either directed at the
mage or somebody else. 


Mark the Blood (Life 2 Prime 2) <Order of the Eternal Dawn>
-----------------------------------------------------------
The mage "marks" the blood of a person. This marking
will be passed on to the children, and so on. Sometimes
this marking is bound to a special trait. The mark can
be read by Life 1. Different markings have different
meanings, and are used to keep track of certain traits.
Mages have also found that there exist other markings in
several bloodlines, which they have not put there. Some
believe that there must have been other mages doing the
same thing as they in the past. Other explain it away as
a "lusus naturae", a strange but useless natural
phenomenon. 


Brew Venom (Life 2 Prime 2 Entropy 1) <Asatru>
----------------------------------------------
While the Vikings regarded poison as foul, some of the
modern asa-mages use it in the defence of their homes
and traditions. By boiling together a foul mixture of
blood, salt, yeast, earth, iron, ice and some drops of
snake venom under invocations of the powers of death,
they create a potent and untraceable poison. The poison
can be applied in food or drink, placed on weapons or
even on surfaces.  The poison will seek out the weakest
point of the victim and make him very sick or kill him. 
[ The poison works as an infection or other disease,
completely coincidental. Typical effects can be heart
attacks, allergic reactions or food poisoning. It will
find the weakest point in the body of the victim using
an effect like Dim Mak and then strike. It does three
times the number of successes damage levels. ]


Magic Mead (Matter 2 Prime 2 Mind 2) <Asatru>
---------------------------------------------
By adding special herbs and some blood to mead and then
brewing it together, the priestess can create a mead
which will infuse the drinker with the emotions of the
her choice. This is used to create the mead drunk during
the blot, or a subtle way of influencing people. 


See through Other Eyes (Life 2/3, Mind 3)
-----------------------------------------
The mage touches an animal (or a plant), draws a circle
on its brow or similar area, and contacts its
consciousness. Now the mage can experience what the
animal feels and see through its senses. He has no
direct control over it, other than emotional impulses
and telepathy. The range can be extended by the use of
Correspondence. 


Commune with Nature (Life 2/3, Mind 2 Correspondence 2)
-------------------------------------------------------
The mage goes into a state of trance and contact the
consciousness of all life around her, and then spread
her senses into the surroundings. The mage feels what
life around her feels, the consciousness of plants and
animals and their positions. With some concentration the
mage can find all animals and plants in the vicinity,
tell their relation to each other and see through their
senses. If something happens to any living being in the
area the mage will immediately feel it. This can of
course cause unpleasant effects if something dramatic or
painful happens. Besides, the mage will have big trouble
returning to just having a single consciousness and a
single body if the experience have lasted long. And
after coming out of her trance the mage is often
disoriented and confused for a while, especially if it
has taken a long time or her consciousness have been
spread out over a large area. 


Talk to animals (Life 2/3 Mind 4)
---------------------------------
Simply contacting the minds of animals (and plants) for
information is seldom useful, since they lack
understanding of human questions and the gift of reason.
But an experienced mage can overcome this by temporary
making the animal intelligent! Verbena do this by
dipping their athame in blood and drawing symbols on the
fur of the animal. The mage builds a temporary mind out
of the memories and personality of the animal (and
partially of the mage) and communicates with it
mentally. In this way the animal can respond to
questions, think and even act intelligently for a while.
But the mage must also keep constant control over its
emotions and mind, since they tend to get confused of
panic. After the rote ends, the animal return to its
original state and forgets everything. 


Simulate (Life 3)
-----------------
Sometimes mages have to appear more hurt than they are,
for example during medical examinations. Using this rote
the mage can simulate all kinds of diseases and wounds,
or make wounds appear healed. Verbena usually wash
themselves with blood and paint their new appearance
using it and special herbs. The results look like the
real thing, but are no real wounds (if the mage doesn't
want to be *too* realistic, of course). By adding Mind 1
the mage can imprint the correct responses too, like
appearing in pain or shivering when touched in certain
spots. 

Eternal Youth (Life 3)
----------------------
The mage simply stops ageing. This requires almost
constant low- level concentration, but is often
coincidentally explained using a healthy diet involving
certain herbs and blood. 


Bath of Beauty (Life 3)
-----------------------
The Verbena have never underestimated the power of youth
and beauty, and have developed this rote. The mage fills
the cauldron with blood, which is consecrated. Then the
mage washes himself from head to feet in the blood while
invoking the powers of youth and life. 
[ Each success triples the number of years the mage
rejuvenates (1 success 1 year, 2 3 years, 3 9 years, 4
27 years...). If the mage wants to continue rejuvenating
another bath is required, and so on.  These changes have
the same weakness as Improve Self, they suffer from
Pattern Bleeding.]


Enchanted Senses (Life 3)
-------------------------
The mage gives himself the sight of the Eagle, the smell
of the Dog, the taste of the Rat and the hearing of the
Cat. Verbena use to do this by anointing eyes, ears,
fingers, nose and tongue with blood while visualising
the power and sounds of the different animals. 


Fountain of Blood (Life 3 Prime 2)
----------------------------------
The mage creates blood. This can be done inside the
mage, inside someone else or even in the environment
(rather vulgar). The amount of blood and the quality
varies depending on how well the mage did. Some Verbena
with a sense of drama use this to multiply blood: they
pour a small amount of blood into the cauldron, and then
makes it rise until it pours over the edges. 


Infection (Life 3 Prime 2)
--------------------------
The mage infects somebody with disease by touching him.
The disease can range from hay fever to anthrax. If the
disease is contagious the victim can himself spread it.
Verbena, who first used this rote, usually take the
blood of a sick animal, and during a long ceremony
concentrate the disease into the blood. Then (for
example) the hand of the mage is coated with the blood,
and used to touch the victim. Sons of Ether use to place
organic material in a vessel, which they then send
electricity through a few hours to cause disrupting
morphogenetic fields to develop. Fragments of the matter
is then placed on the victim. 
[ The mage must succeed on a number of successes
dependent on how serious or complex the disease is. One
success is enough for common, fairly benign diseases
like colds or warts. Two successes gives more serious
diseases like mumps, gonorrhoea or glaucoma.  Three
gives life threatening diseases like Multiple Sclerosis
or Pestilence. Four successes can create practically
incurable diseases like AIDS or severe Cancer. With five
successes the mage can create all known diseases and a
few unknown. ]


Mead of blood (Life 3 Prime 2) <Asatru>
---------------------------------------
This rote may have started as a kind of travesty of the
Catholic Mass. By pouring mead into the bowl and adding
a few drops of blood, the priest can turn it into blood.
However, it doesn't have to look like blood or taste
like it, the priest can make it appear to be normal
mead. Afterwards, the mead can be used instead of blood
as a foci, be imbibed as a source of strength or even
used as sustenance for vampires (although practically no
modern kindred know about this. Only the oldest
Scandinavian Methuselahs have tasted such mead). 


Reanimation (Life 3 Prime 2) <Alchemists>
----------------------------------------
The alchemist burns a dead (or alive) plant or animal.
The hot ashes is mixed with exotic chemicals and salts.
Finally gold solved in aqua regia is added, and the
mixture is allowed to crystallise. By performing the
necessary incantation and slowly heating the resulting
salts, the mage will restore the being to life. If the
mage succeed well enough, the being will be completely
normal in all aspects. A less successful experiment
would give a being which would die after a while,
turning into salts again. And really bad results create
"nothing but ye liveliest Awfullness". Some alchemists
experiment with turning people to dust, and trying to
raise them again. If anyone have succeeded, they have
not told anybody. 


Hunting Horror (Life 3 Prime 3 Mind 2)
--------------------------------------
The mage creates a living being and imprints hate
against someone in its mind. Now the being will
relentlessly seek to destroy the victim using all
available means until it is killed or the target is
killed. This rote can be used on normal animals too,
turning them into killing weapons. With Life 4 the
animal can be given extra weapons like sharper claws,
poison or fangs. 


Bond of Blood (Life 3 Prime 3 Correspondence 2) <Hunters Hunted>
----------------------------------------------------------------
Arctus developed this rote. By charging his blood with
quintessence linked to him by drinking liquid Tass, he
can give his blood the power of blood bond. Anyone
drinking it three times will be blood bound to the mage
(although this bond doesn't last as long as a vampiric
blood bond). 


Homunculus (Life 3 Spirit 2 Prime 2 Time 3) <Alchemists>
--------------------------------------------------------
Paracelsus developed this famous rote. The mage takes
some of his bodily fluids, adds silver and gold salts,
and pour the result into a vessel. The vessel is kept at
a constant body temperature for nine months (In the
middle ages, a heap of dung was used). After the time, a
small, fully grown man have developed in the vessel.
This homunculus is intelligent, have a will of his own
and will grow at the normal rate after he have left the
vessel. Some mages keep their homunculus inside it for
safe keeping, feeding them of their own blood. Homunculi
are often used as advisors, familiars or servants. But
if the mage treat them bad, they may rise up against
him. 


Dissolve (Life 4) <Euthanatos>
------------------------------
A nasty rote invented by a desperate and hateful
Euthanatos against her master. The mage dissolves the
tissues of her victim. Bones become flexible, muscles
turn into jelly and the blood become almost etheric. 
Usually the victim just collapses and burst open, in a
gross and very vulgar display. 


End Blood (Life 4)
------------------
The mage touches the victim with some blood (very little
is required). The result is a small infection rendering
the victim sterile and unable to pass on undesirable
traits. The victim will not notice anything. 



Constrict Gene Generation ( **** Entropy, and either **** Correspondence,
                                *** Life, or **** Life ) by Michael M. Moolick
        This rote is, as Life Hacking, a closely guarded secret of
the Reality Hackers.  They will use it for others ( for a sufficient favor )
but will never divulge it's secret to anyone not of their small order.
        The Traditions continual seek ways to foil the threat of
Progenito Cloning.  This rote is one such means of anti-cloning methods.
        It's use causes small errors in the recipient's gene structure
to be produces, seeds for a chaotic process of cellular degredation.
This degredation causes the cell to begin making "suicidal" enzymes and
structural components.  Progenitors trying to use such a cell for cloning
will find the cells untenable, they die out in less than ten divisions.
        The rote has three specific sub-versions.  All require the adept
to make a computer model of the recipient's DNA.
        The first works along with Correspondence **** and can take
up to a week to run.  It causes all cells that the recipient has already
shed to undergo the entropic genetic change.  It takes so long because
the computer must Sort Through All-Space to find every little cell.  This
affects cells with the recipient's DNA even if they are dead.
        The second works on the mage himself, involves life 3, and causes
the cells he sheds to develop the entropic gene sequences..
        The third and final version uses Life four and is the same as the
second version except it is used by the adept on another.

[       Each success removes two successes from any attempt to clone/grow
the effected cells.  The second and third versionswill cause pattern bleeding
if maintained beyond their normal duration, so Life Hackers often run this
rote regularly to ensure pattern interity.
        Life hackers insist their appretices submit to versions one and three
of this rote before sharing any of the secrets of the Life Hacking rote
itself.
        Paradox rote can cause the early expression of the gene errors or
strike a close relative with them ( similar codons ).  I don't really
want to think what version 1 would do if someone had a clone made or
to an identical twin. ]
