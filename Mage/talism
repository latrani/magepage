The Purse of Tommy **

This is an apparently quite normal purse, filled with the usual money, 
plastic cards, old notes and fluff. However, if one digs deep enough 
(its much deeper on the inside than the outside), one can find tickets to 
movies and rock-concerts. Some of them are several years in the future, 
or aren't even planned yet! Needless to say, this is a highly prized 
talisman by the cultists of ecstasy. 

High Frequency Personality Merger *****

This is a rather unremarkable booth made of beige plastic, with a small
control console on the inside. When activated by someone inside, the
molecular bonds in his body are neutralized and he is held together by a
field of neutrinos. When he leaves the booth, the field will collapse as
soon as he touches somebody else with a personality (it is unknown what
will happen if he touches a spirit, an animal or intelligent computer). 
The two persons merge into one, with the skills, memories and
personalities of both. Usually the merged person will be rather confused,
trying to do several things at once, loudly arguing with himself etc.
(this can be ameliorated with Mind 1, multitasking). A small problem is
that the merger cannot take merged persons apart... 
[ The merged person will have the best rating of any of its constituent
persons in any ability. Appearance and personality will be an mixture of
the constituents. ]
