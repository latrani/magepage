   A Euthanatos Chantry in the Northern California by Night

   There is a stretch along the Pacific Coast Highway (Hwy 1),
  between Pacifica and Half Moon Bay, that has a mistique about it,
  a strange, almost forboding feeling. It also has a reputation as
  one of the deadliest stretches of highway in California. Nestled
  off to the side of the road, off one of the gentler curves, lies
  a small farmstead with some communal housing. This is the Silver
  Sunset Ranch.
   <h2>
    Description
   </h2>
   The Silver Sunset Ranch is an experimental
  hospice, a home for the terminally ill. Those people who wish to
  die with dignity, away from the debilitating atmosphere of modern
  hospitals, can find a place here. They will live out the last
  days, moths, or even years of their lives feeling somewhat
  useful, accomplishing things they never could have while in a
  hospital.
   <p>
    The Ranch itself is not very large, only about 250 acres along
  a gently sloping hillside between two of the hills that form the
  San Francisco Ridge. A small stream runs down from the upper
  hills to the ocean, running under a small bridge and falling the
  last 50 feet over a cliff to the ocean below. There are a few
  horses, some cattle, greenhouses, and an extensive garden and
  plowed fields. There are always people out, tending the animals,
  repairing the road or the buildings, working in the garden, or
  just out for a stroll along the stream. There is also a large
  pool behind the main building, where sometimes the patients here
  will go swimming.
   </p>
   <h2>
    History
   </h2>
   The Silver Sunset Ranch has been around for over
  75 years, back before the explosion of population in the Bay Area
  forced property values through the roof. Originally owned by a
  wealthy investor from Manhattan who wanted to settle down and
  live the quiet, neo-Frontier life, on his death he donated it to
  a small, non-profit group that helped him in his final months,
  the Guardians of Dignity.
   <p>
    Upon his death, the Guardians of Dignity (actually a
  Euthanatos cabal drawn to the great potential of the Bay Area)
  moved to establish the Silver Sunset Ranch, and set it up as a
  home for the elderly and the terminally ill. They have housed
  some famous figures in their last hours, and also tend to some
  locals who are terminally ill but wish to stay in their own
  homes.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Silver Sunset Ranch has met with no interference from the
  outside world, many of whom think the work here a little macabre,
  but very humane nonetheless. They survive on donations and their
  modest fee, as well as the work of the patients on the grounds.
  They have recently been awarded several honors from the state of
  California, the government of the United States, and humane
  groups from around the world.
   </p>
   <h2>
    How It Works
   </h2>
   The magi use the Silver Sunset Ranch for
  three purposes. First and foremost, it is an effective cover for
  them from the prying eyes of the Technocracy. Who would suspect a
  group of mostly older do-gooders were actually dangerous
  magicians out to subvert the paradigm? Secondly, given its
  location near a rather highly-travelled and dangerous chunk of
  road, it lets them selectively "remove" individuals who happen to
  come by, with a very limited addition of Entropy. The number of
  accidents here has not increased or decreased much since the
  Guardians moved in, though those that have died often are more
  deserving of the Good Death than others.
   <p>
    Third, and maybe the most important in the eyes of the
  Ascension War, this place allows the Euthanatos magi to find
  those who truly understand the cycle, and the way of things.
  Those for whom the time has come, they help achieve the Good
  Death without pain and without suffering a death of the spirit,
  letting them walk proudly into the shadows of Death. For those
  that do still have potential, however, the magi can often give
  them a reason to keep on living, and to make the changes they
  need to in their lives to do the things they still are able to
  do. Three best-selling novels have been written by patients at
  the Silver Sunset Ranch, and two more are becoming actors and
  activists. And those that really understand the ways of Death and
  the world are taken to the edge of Death, where, should they
  Awaken, they are returned to the world as new Euthanatos magi
  (with the added bonus of being declared legally dead.)
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus the Silver Sunset Ranch is a very valuable tool to all
  the Traditions in the Ascension War, particularly the Euthanatos,
  who are attempting to combat the image that they ar "bloodthirsty
  killers" with no sense of remorse.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Node and Horizon Realm
   </h2>
   The Silver Sunset Ranch is set on
  a Node of relatively little power, though it radiates a sense of
  peace and tranquility that is commented upon by all those who
  visit. The limited power of this Node means there is no real
  Horizon Realm associated with this Chantry, though they have been
  storing the Tass (in the form of dried flowers from the gardens)
  for times of emergency.
   <h2>
    Relations with Other Magi
   </h2>
   The Chantry of the Gold Coast
  is aware of the presence of the Silver Sunset Ranch and what it
  really is. While they do not actively assist the Ranch, they do
  not work against it, either, seeing them as casual allies in
  their more aggressive battle against the Technocracy.
   <p>
    The Scarlet Mansion, however, has no idea that these magi even
  exist, and this is considered by most of the Guardians of DIgnity
  to be a good thing, as they have occasionally had to work against
  the drug trade practiced by their Cultist neighbors, and even
  once had to deliver the Good Death to one of the higher members
  of that Chantry. If their presence were to be discovered, there
  would be a major altercation indeed.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Magi
   </h2>
   There are currently only four magi at the Silver
  Sunset Ranch, though there are several potential Initiates among
  the current patients. These magi are as follows:
   <h3>
    Dr. Stephen Andrews
   </h3>
   Dr. Andrews is a well known
  psychiatrist, who has specialized in the role of self-esteem and
  happiness in the processes of healing and dying. He has written
  several works on how to deal with terminal illness, both for the
  il land for their families, and is considered an expert on the
  subject. He is also a Master of Entropy and an Adept of Life,
  using this ability to mold an already deceased individual into
  the likeness of one of their new Initiates, therefore helping
  them hide from the Technocracy. He will not use his magics to
  heal the illnesses that have stricken his patients, unless they
  would present more possibilities without their illness and would
  learn nothing from the experience. Now in his late 50s, Dr.
  Andrews is beginning to reach the twilight of his career, and has
  considered stepping down from administering the Silver Sunset
  Ranch, handing it over to his assistant, Janine.
   <h3>
    Dr. Janine Mathau
   </h3>
   Dr. Mathau is Dr. Andrews' protege, and
  has shown some brilliant insight into the process of grief among
  the terminally ill. Also rather well published, she is seen as a
  rising star in her profession and heir to Dr. Andrews in almost
  everything. In truth, she cares for Dr. Andrews very dearly, and
  fears the day when she will be asked to give him the Good Death,
  though she deals with this trial every day. In her mid-30s, she
  has a long and fruitful career ahead of her.
   <h3>
    Robert Schimmel
   </h3>
   As head groundskeeper, he is often called
  on to teach the new patients something about the tending of the
  animals and the plants around the Ranch. A very down to earth
  individual, he teaches people various crafts to help them pass
  the time constructively while they await their coming Death. He
  is very friendly, and very amiable, with a good eye for what
  people would like to learn the most in the waning years of their
  lives (Mind 3). No one knows how old he is, though he looks to be
  about 40.
   <h3>
    Kathy Davenport
   </h3>
   Both of Kathy's parents were patients at
  the Ranch, having gotten AIDS when they were in a car accident
  while Kathy was only 6. Kathy was virtually raised by the staff
  at the Ranch, and they quickly realized her potential. Taking her
  by the cliffs one day, they Awakened her, and she quickly learned
  what they had to teach. Seen as a haunted young woman, she is 19,
  but looks in her upper twenties, and beautiful in an ethereal
  sort of way. She most often is the one responsible for "tending"
  to the worst parts of Highway 1, and will spend four or five
  nights a week on an outcrop, near the shore, under the light of
  the moon.
