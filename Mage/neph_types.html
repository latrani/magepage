   Study of the Nephandi is a dangerous business, albeit lethal. On
  the other hand, one can't keep repeatedly battling them all over
  creation without picking up a few bits of information. If nothing
  else, survival usually means figuring out what tactics work and
  which ones haven't. I myself have tried to catalog my years of
  experience in hopes that the next generation might have a lower
  fatality rate in dealing with monstrosities from the Umbra.
   <p>
    The main confusion about the Nephandi comes from the
  categorization of three distinct classes of being under one
  common grouping. These classes have distinct motivations and
  powers, and different tactics are required for each of them. Be
  forewarned that each category has a huge variety of beings, and
  there are exceptions to the general run of tactics. Let my
  recommendations to you be a guideline rather than hard rules.
  There are no hard and fast rules in this game. That is the only
  rule that one must pay attention to.
   </p>
   <p>
    The first class of beings that are generally classified as
  Nephandi are those beings from the High Umbral realms
  encompassing the various vices that most people term evil. When
  one has the concept of a sin, one can usually find an Umbral
  source reflecting that concept. The usual term for these beings
  is demons. Some speculate that the Catholic Church, with its
  heavy emphasis on the evils of many practices, created many of
  these beings which haunt our world today. The Celestial Chorus
  denies this, but their viewpoint is not a neutral and unbiased
  one.
   </p>
   <p>
    Demons in many ways are the most benign of a bad lot. Keep in
  mind these beings derive power from the reinforcement of their
  particular vice, and thus demons of adultery encourage
  extramarital sex with accompanying extramaterial guilt. Demons of
  alcoholism would like to see everyone with rotting livers and
  shattered hopes. Demons of fear and despair have been the doom of
  many a mage. They are out to corrupt you and they are experts at
  this dreadful subject.
   </p>
   <p>
    On the other hand, they're not as bad as the second category,
  the servants of something the Garou call "the Wyrm". Whether or
  not the Garou legends are correct, there is a vast spiritual
  corruption in the Umbra. Some cosmic force is broken and twisted,
  and is corrupting the rest of reality, seeking to annihilate it
  for its own twisted purposes. That this force is insane is
  somewhat in question, as the whole notion of sanity at that level
  is difficult to define. But there are creatures that for
  notational purposes I'll call Wyrm-spawn out there. The force
  they serve has countless manifestations, and so there is great
  variety in the servants as well.
   </p>
   <p>
    They seek the corruption and ultimate annihilation of reality.
  In this they differ from demons, who wish to preserve reality to
  inflict more evil. A plaque demon seeks everyone to be sick, and
  derives some pleasure from wiping out chunks of population due to
  death. But they are also in general careful to preserve survivors
  of the plague, in varying degrees of health, so as to ensure
  future generations to infect with their diseases. A
  plague-bearing Wyrm-spawn wants to wipe out all life with its
  diseases. It may seek the annihilation slowly, to prolong its own
  pleasure, but in the end it wants everything completely and
  totally dead.
   </p>
   <p>
    This difference has led to occasional antagonisms between
  Nephandi and demons. My general policy has to been to encourage
  this friction when present, but I'm not so foolish enough as to
  try to create it in the first place. First and foremost, there's
  a big danger the demon will get corrupted by the Wyrm-spawn, as
  has happened quite a few times. The other big problem is that
  they often have the same short term goals, and may try to form
  alliances and screw each other over later. Sure they'll come to
  blows, but only after the damage has been done. I try to break up
  such alliances by promoting the differences in subtle ways,
  forcing an early break.
   </p>
   <p>
    The third category is a bit distinct from the other two. Many
  mages have theorized, and I concur, that there are other worlds
  that do not revolve around the Tellurian. Beyond the Horizon
  there lie other worlds, other systems of realms. The Technocracy
  has worked it out, and on the purely physical level, removed
  these systems to light years away, then enforced the speed of
  light barrier to keep these places far away from us. Isolation on
  the physical level, while ignoring the fact that the Umbral realm
  plays by different rules.
   </p>
   <p>
    These realms are not recognizable to us. Formed totally
  independently from Gaia, they do not necessarily follow the same
  laws of nature. Indeed, from what I've seen, I doubt we'd
  recognize anything about these strange realms. Many of these
  beings don't seem to follow the same rules of time and space that
  we do. I'm not even sure they necessarily have the same duality
  of matter and spirit that we do, though when they are in our
  realm, they are forced to play by our rules somewhat, though
  interpreting their existence in terms of our rule setups lead to
  amazing side effects.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are a couple of universalities. They seem to have minds,
  though vastly different than our own, and they also use
  Quintessence, which strikes me as a strong argument in favor of
  the theories that posit those two Spheres as being more
  fundamental than any of the others. These universalities don't do
  us any good, and in fact are a real problem in that these Aliens,
  as I dub them, are interested in harnessing our reality as a
  giant Quintessence pool, to pipe back beyond the Horizon to their
  own realms.
   </p>
   <p>
    There seem to be multiple categories of Aliens, and not all of
  them seem to function as a harmonious whole. Trying to take
  advantage of these rivalries would require gathering enough
  information about them to be able to play Alien politics, and
  that sort of information gathering is a trifle too dangerous for
  me to recommend to anyone. The two categories I've broken Aliens
  down to, and this is only my experience guided by my human
  intelligence, which may be getting all the facts wrong, are the
  Plunderers and the Harvesters.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Plunderers have a "drain the Quintessence and run"
  strategy. That makes them easier and harder to deal with. On the
  one hand, its easier to drive them off, on the other hand, you
  have to maintain a watch on various Nodes and other vulnerable
  spots. The Harvesters set up long term housekeeping, and may even
  be interested in colonization. They are easier to detect, since
  they have to build installations. On the other hand, raiding an
  Alien installation isn't exactly what I'd call a good time.
   </p>
   <p>
    The main dangers to the average mage from the Aliens tend to
  be more on the physical level, though many want to harness mages
  as allies and promise alien knowledge and technology as benefits.
  The Technomancers, including the Sons of Ether and Virtual
  Adepts, seem especially vulnerable to this approach, though their
  technology does seem to have an easier time fighting the Alien
  threat, probably due to similarity. They are also not above
  capturing even the most mystic mage and doing some nasty
  spell/implants to convert them over to their side. The mixing of
  the human and inhuman usually drives any of these converts nuts.
  This insanity makes them harder to predict, and more dangerous
  thereby.
   </p>
   <p>
    In fact, the biggest danger the Aliens pose is that they are
  unpredictable. Demons and Wyrm-spawn are nasty and corrupt, but
  they are to a large extent comprehensible. (indeed, that is what
  makes them so dangerous, we can understand their thoughts, and
  there lies their temptation) Aliens manifest unpredictable powers
  and their thought patterns aren't like anything we've seen. Don't
  try to second-guess an Alien. Work on flexibility and be prepared
  for anything. Get a decent size group with overlapping Spheres
  and work on trying strange stuff. Don't hesitate to experiment.
  Often these buggers manifest the weirdest vulnerabilities.
   </p>
   <p>
    So my general advice is to try to figure out which category
  the potential Nephandi are from. It can often be hard to
  distinguish Wyrm-spawn from either demons in the case of
  spiritual corruptors or from Aliens in terms of physical
  weirdness from the Deep Umbra. In the case of demons, a little
  virtue goes a long way. Driving them into the Deep Umbra, maybe
  weakening their grip on the local mundanes by instilling a little
  virtue in the masses goes a long way. The Celestial Chorus is
  usually the best for handling this problem. Don't hesitate to
  call them in for assistance or at least for consultation.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Wyrm-spawn can be trickier, since they work on the
  chain-letter principle. Turn one person into a
  destroyer/corrupter and let them convert others and so forth.
  Wiping them out is the easiest option. Stomp them flat. Just be
  careful they don't infect you with their poison. Many will forgo
  their objectives of building a toxic waste dump if they can
  secure a mage's soul in the process. Go for the offensive. They
  want to damage the world. Take them out before they can do that.
  Talk to the local Garou, see if you can work with them (best to
  let the Verbena or the Dreamspeakers approach the Garou,
  especially the latter).
   </p>
   <p>
    Aliens are the simplest to deal with. Kill them. Actually,
  there may be Aliens who are interested in helping us and being
  nice to us, but I haven't met that many and frankly, I'd be
  suspicious of their lore in any case. The big problem is trying
  to figure out how to fight them. Don't assume the same trick
  works twice, or even once. Notify the Technocracy. They hate the
  Aliens just as much as we do, and they have more firepower to
  deal with the threat. Let them get themselves bloody in the
  process, just make sure they enforce their "no Alien tech"
  policy. Their R&amp;D guys are too weird already.

    Good hunting, remember, vigilance must be eternal.
