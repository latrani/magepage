   Shiverer

   I was walking along the concrete alley behind the Institute
  carrying a huge pile of the white boxes when I heard the cry of a
  baby. At first I was unsure from where it came, I scanned the
  facade above me for open windows, but slowly the inescapable
  conclusion crept over me. I began to frantically search through
  the boxes, putting my ear against the smooth plastic and
  discarding the silent ones. Finally I found it, and rushed inside
  - the alley was no place for this.
  </p>
  <p>
   Inside the Christmas party was well underway; the others were
  eating and drinking and making merry, and when I stormed into the
  room with the box and quickly explained the situation
  Dr. Davies even applauded: "A new-born child on Christmas!"
  and laughed loudly. I began to remove the plastic inserts, the
  salad, small cans of anchovies and pieces of bread from the box,
  while the others expectantly looked on and Christmas music played
  (too loud, where were the cries?). I finally reached the bottom
  of the box, but at first I didn't understand what I found. The
  laughter and smiles began to fade as they saw my face, and when I
  lifted up what I found many faces contorted in disgust.
  </p>
  <p>
   Salt water dripped from my fingers as I examined the
   <i>
    thing
   </i>
   I had found, and there was a definite fishy smell.
  The body was definitely humanoid, maybe five months developed,
  but attached where the head should be was two long black shiny
  things which hung limply from my hand, like aquatic shoe-strings.
  No wonder it had stopped crying. In a zip-lock bag inside the box
  I found the fragile fan-like tentacles, kept in a saline
  solution. I turned at the others, who all stood silent, accusing
  me of having disrupted their party. But I couldn't stop myself
  from explaining, despite their disapproval: "This is definitely
  something from the order Polychaeta. I think it must have got
  loose from one of the cans and begun to assemble itself..."
  </p>
  <p>
   He awoke, not with a start but with a moan. A quick look at
  the clock told him it was too late to go back to sleep anyway, so
  he went up and began his breakfast ritual. It was at times like
  this he really wanted Professor Heiselberg and his team to
  succeed, despite their personal and professional differences. Why
  can't we move short-term memories from hippocampus into long-term
  memory without involving conscious (or at least semi-conscious)
  experience? In theory it would be so simple, just a block on the
  ascending fibres from the subiculum... But he knew that was a
  long-term dream, and probably just as well. When he began to
  analyse the fragments of his dream, he noted the usual elements:
  fear of disapproval from his colleagues, a sense of futility in
  saving lives, a horror for both the natural and unnatural...
  probably half the Institute had the same traits. But that didn't
  make him feel the better.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the foyer of the Institute he met Dr. Vassiliadis, always
  happy and cheerful as usual (the lucky bastard probably had some
  biochemical screw-up in his endorphin system). He held open the
  elevator doors with a great deal more strength than was
  needed.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Morning! Heard that you met with The Representative
  yesterday?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Don't talk about it. You already know how it went."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Let me see... was it 'Due to the current budgetary
  constraints we cannot approve any more funding to this kind of
  basic research' or 'Sorry, there is no Market for that'?" Dr.
  Vassiliadis had the intonations down pat, and both laughed.
  </p>
  <p>
   "A bit of both. I pointed out to him that the project would
  save a few million people if it worked, and he just responded 'If
  it works, yes'. Damned yuppie probably thought the people the
  project might save didn't have a high enough income bracket to be
  interesting."
  </p>
  <p>
   "That is the general error with people like him. No connection
  with reality at all. Unlike us." He laughed and stepped out of
  the elevator.
  </p>
  <p>
   The rest of the morning went on as usual, skimming through the
  mail and adding another score of post-it labels to his terminal
  (Dr. Vassiliadis of course called it the "autumn computer" -
  lots of yellow leaves that fall off in the breeze). His mood
  didn't get any better, but at least he could bury himself in
  paperwork instead of thinking of funding or things in white
  boxes. A paper from Peter caught his notice - "Perspectives of
  MPTP Induced Degeneration of the Nigrostriatal Pathway in the
  Presence of L-Deprenyl". The boy was doing fine, as usual. That
  paper was bound to become widely cited, if only for the raw data.
  Funny, he thought, that those Californian junkies had
  accidentally stumbled upon what could be the key to Parkinson's
  disease. Sometimes fate was ironic - we spent several decades
  poisoning our rats without succeeding in making them
  parkinsonian, and that chemistry student just messed up his
  heroin synthesis and created instant parkinsonism. Well, at least
  they did humanity some good.
  </p>
  <p>
   He went down into the basement lab to check the experiments.
  There were almost nobody here, all the research students were
  busy with something in the B wing. His steps echoed through the
  concrete corridors and clean labs. It was peaceful here, a cool
  place to calm down in.
  </p>
  <p>
   The shiverer mice spasmed as soon as he entered the room, one
  curling up into a tiny ball as he watched it. He gently picked it
  up and stroked the fur, feeling the tense shivering muscles
  beneath. "One day," he promised the misshapen little lifeform "we
  will be able to cure you. We will make your Schwann cells produce
  myelin, wrapping themselves around your axons..."
  </p>
  <p>
   "It deserves death" someone said behind him. He quickly turned
  around, the mouse still his palm. Behind him, in the doorway
  stood a ragged man. He gave a vague impression of vagabond mixed
  with street lunatic. Mirrorshades didn't combine well with a
  smelly jacket with Chinese coins sewn on. In his hand was a long
  knife.
  </p>
  <p>
   "It is in pain, because you need it for your experiments.
  Hoping to better humanity. When you should let it die". Each
  statement hung in the air like a smoke cloud, slowly twisting and
  unfolding as he backed away from the intruder who slowly advanced
  on him, gesturing with his knife.
  </p>
  <p>
   This had to be one of
   <i>
    them
   </i>
   . He had never met one
  before, but the intruder fit the description perfectly. This was
  no normal animal rights activist or biofundamentalist, this was a
  full-fledged reality deviant. Armed. Insane. Bent on killing
  him.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Death is the natural consequence of life. Inevitable.
  Hindering it isn't even wrong - it is impossible!". The intruder
  spat out the last words as he moved forward.
  </p>
  <p>
   The lifted blade reflected the room like a mirror. The light
  that had bounced from the animal cages filled with watching mice
  bounced from the arrayed atoms in the knife, refracted through
  his eyes and hit the retina. The retinal cells transduced it into
  electrochemical impulses that were processed by his bipolar and
  amacrine cells, rushed along the ganglion cells of his optic
  nerve, merged and divided in his optic chiasm and hit the lateral
  geniculate nuclei. Glutamate jumped across a synapse, and axons
  moved the signal into his visual cortex, into the secondary,
  tertiary and higher-order visual cortices; sending the room into
  his association cortex where it was refracted, associated,
  changed by patterns that were
   <i>
    him
   </i>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   He threw the mouse at the intruder. The little white ball
  moved through the air like a furry baseball - innocent, fearful
  and powerless. The intruder smiled slightly, and swung his arm in
  an arc faster than thought. The knife neatly divided the mouse
  into two dead pieces, red blood against white fur hanging in the
  air. The arm and knife continued their deadly arc past the chain
  of the emergency shower. The knife snagged, the chain tensed and
  water poured down over the intruder as the knife buried itself in
  the wall. The accident alarm started.
  </p>
  <p>
   He didn't think, he just rushed to the doorway and hit the
  emergency seal (thank goodness for safety regulations and
  paranoid virologists!). The moment the blast door shut he saw the
  intruder running towards it, soaking wet, his glasses lost (he
  had Asiatic eyes) and the remains of a shiverer mouse still stuck
  on his disgusting jacket between two coins. Then metal, painted a
  flaking white, banged together and he was alone in the basement
  corridor. He sank to the concrete floor shivering as he listened
  to the sound of running steps and alarms.
  </p>
  <p>
   "I promise you. I will make your vesicles link with synapsine
  and actin. Everything will be fine..."
