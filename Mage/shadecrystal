The Shade Crystal:
By Reverend Kinesys,

Lost in the mists of antiquity, these items are fairly rare. It is said 
that only thirty of them exist and the methods for creating new ones are 
forever lost. They are black crystals of extreme hardness and they are 
flat and unreflective. often they are  found with a silver chain and 
cage arrangement but others are found alone. The gems have a sort of 
runic language that is cut into them that is undecipherable. Hermetic 
mages believe them to be of egyptian manufacture but some also posit 
that they might be sumerian.
  Shade crystals have an unusual ability. when worn over the heart,that 
ability can be called into effect. A mage spends a point of his own 
personal quintessence.(no tass)
and the shade crystal will massively amplify his ability to be Arcane. 
In effect, the expenditure of Quintessence causes the mages rating in 
arcane to jump to 5 for one full day and one full night.  The Crystal 
does not require that the mage have prime 3 to channel quintessence into 
it. but it also does not have its own store of quintessence on which to 
draw. Hermetics theorize that its power derives from some powerful, and 
partialy natural, resonance effect. all that is required of the mage is 
a point of his avatar quintessence and concentration for a full 
minute.even those who do not have Arcane can benefit from the power of 
the shade crystal.
 The user effectively ceases to exist for a day. Those who have close 
emotional ties to the user will not forget them but if they are out of 
sight they will cease thinking about you at all. The user does not 
become invisible but she becomes so unobtrusive that she might as well 
be. Antagonists that are shooting at anything that moves will note 
movement in their line of sight but otherwise may not notice the mage.
  To people other than those who are close to the mage the mage 
effectively ceases to exist. phone numbers become lost,computer files 
become corrupted,Hardcopy files get coffee spilled on them, Sneaking 
into the movies or the subway become easy as pie. Obfuscated vampires 
will notice something go by... maybe. and vampires with high auspex 
might notice you if they happen to be looking.
  Continued use of this article causes the mage to unwittingly leave his 
life behind. (if he's not carefull.) If used for more than four days 
running. Those with close ties will forget they knew you at all. Or even 
convince themselves that you are dead or lost in a paradox realm 
somewhere. Arch-enemies will get on with their lives. Witch hunters will 
be confused. Your parents and your children will rearrange their 
personal histories and all traces of your identity will erase 
themselves. You may even come home to discover that someone is selling 
your house.If you aren't prepared for this it could drive you into a 
seriously deep quiet.
 It is also known,that mummies are capable of using these items and 
power them with Sekhem and in fact use them to leave lives behind them 
on occasion. it is rumored that they are the creators of these items but 
that even they have forgotten how to make more. Considering the nature 
of the Shade crystals, this is not all that unusual.
