    The Paradox rules in 2nd Ed Mage are amazing; so few changes,
  yet such a dramatic improvement on the original. I can't help
  tinkering with a good thing, so here are my additions to the
  paradox rules. Mostly, they are suggestions for quickly resolving
  which of the various types of Paradox strike a mage.
   </p>
   <p>
    Paradox Backlash occurs when the mage gains at least six
  points of Paradox at one time, or the mage accumulates 11 or more
  points of Paradox total. Determine the strength of the backlash
  by rolling the character's Paradox Pool (equal to his total
  number of Paradox points, including those newly acquired) against
  difficulty 6. Each success expels one point of Paradox from the
  mage's pattern, and the total number of successes is the strength
  of the backlash.
   </p>
   <p>
    Paradox Backlash will manifest in a physical, spiritual or
  mental form. The Storyteller can choose how the Backlash
  manifests, or roll a die to determine this: 1-5 physical, 6-8
  spiritual, 9-10 mental. Depending on the strength of the Backlash
  and how it manifests, the effects of the backlash may vary.
   </p>
   <pre>
    LEVEL          Physical            Spiritual           Mental
1-5            Flaws               Paradox Minion      Quiet
6-9            Damage              Paradox Preceptor   Quiet/Realm
10+            Explosion           Paradox Lord        Realm
   </pre>
   <p>
    <i>
     Flaws
    </i>
    - Paradox cause physical alterations in a mage or
  the immediate area. The stronger the backlash, the more severe
  the alteration. For more details on Flaws, see below.
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     Damage
    </i>
    - The mage receives one Health Level of
  aggravated damage per point of strength of the Backlash. The mage
  may roll to soak this damage (using Stamina), but cannot heal it
  magickally. A backlash this severe can kill the offending mage,
  especially if she was already wounded.
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     Explosion
    </i>
    - A massive explosion results, inflicting
  Health Levels of aggravated damage equal to the strength of the
  Backlash, divided evenly amongst everyone within a few yards of
  the mage. As above, the victims may soak the damage, but it
  cannot be healed magickally.
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     Spirits
    </i>
    - A paradox spirit appears and plagues the
  mage. The level of power of the spirit depends on the strength of
  the backlash, while the nature of the spirit depends on the
  sphere of magick the mage was using. Paradox spirits are
  exceptionally resistant to magick; they may roll their
  Gnosis/Arete as countermagick automatically. Usually there is
  some way a mage can appease a Paradox spirit so that it will
  leave her be. The mage can also try and destroy the spirit using
  non-magickal means. Failing all else, most paradox spirits will
  eventually get bored, and wander off to harass some other
  mage.
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     Quiet
    </i>
    - Quiet can be induced as a backlash. However,
  the strength of the quiet does not depend on the strength of the
  backlash. Instead, it depends on the total points of paradox the
  mage had immediately before the backlash. Quiet can be induced by
  other means, such as the overuse of perceptual magick, or psychic
  trauma (storytellers option). Detailed descriptions of quiet
  appear in the mage rules.
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     Realms
    </i>
    - Truly horrendous backlashes can remove a mage
  from reality completely. Some mages view this as an advanced form
  of Quiet, in which the mage is physically locked in a
  hallucinatory Realm. Examples of different Paradox realms are
  again detailed in the rules.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Paradox Flaws
   </h3>
   <p>
    The most common backlash is a Paradox Flaw of some sort. There
  are two schools of thought about the nature of Paradox Flaws. The
  loose school feels that a Paradox Flaw can be anything, a
  manifestation of wild magick. The hard school believes that
  Paradox should not make reality stranger, and that Flaws should
  manifest in a "coincidental" way. According to the second school,
  Paradox should make problems for a mage, but in a way that could
  be accepted as reasonably normal by a Sleeper. Personally, I tend
  to flip-flop between the two schools, depending on my mood and
  the circumstances; the more sleepers that are around, the less
  likely it is that Paradox will be "vulgar".
   </p>
   <p>
    Note that Paradox need not show up right away. Just because a
  mage suffered a backlash doesn't mean you have to hit him with it
  immediately. You can hold it off for a bit, and then hit the mage
  with the Paradox when he is in a sticky situation. Alternately,
  if a mage suffers a major backlash during an important juncture,
  where it might disrupt the flow of the story, put it off until
  later. You can even put off Paradox just to make your players
  sweat a bit, and give yourself time to think of something really
  clever. In general you shouldn't put Paradox between sessions. It
  becomes to much of a temptation to forget it completely.
   </p>
   <p>
    Under the new rules, the player no longer has any control over
  how a Paradox Flaw manifests; it is all in the hands of the
  storyteller. If you have good set of roleplayers, though, there
  is nothing to stop you from soliciting suggestions from a player.
  Better yet, solicit suggestions from the *other* players; peers
  can be so cruel. You can even take those suggestions, and add
  nasty little twists of your own.
   </p>
   <p>
    The simplest sort of Paradox Flaw is to make the punishment
  fit the crime: take whatever magick the mage was working, and
  twist it in some unpleasant way. You can reverse the magick,
  making it have the opposite effect, or rebound it onto the mage
  (or one of his companions). You can have the magick manifest in
  strange ways, through a "coincidence gone bad". For example, if a
  mage is trying to magick a door open while sneaking into a
  building, the "coincidence" might be that the hinges are weak,
  and the entire door falls out of its frame with a loud bang,
  attracting the attention of the guards. You can also use sphere
  effects for ideas for Paradox Flaws. Simply take one of the
  effects for the sphere, of the appropriate rating, and inflict it
  on the hapless mage.
   </p>
   <p>
    The severity of the flaw depends on the exact strength of the
  backlash. Flaws can be broken into five different levels. Level 1
  Flaws are minor annoyances that last only a few seconds (rare,
  under these rules). Level 2 Flaws hinder the mage in some slight
  way, and usually last for a while (hours). Level 3 Flaws cause
  serious problems, and also last for a decent period of time
  (hours or days). The mage can even be slightly injured by such
  flaws (one or two Health Levels). Level 4 Flaws can be crippling,
  possibly causing serious harm (three or four Health Levels)
  forcing the mage to retreat and recuperate. Level 5 Flaws can
  incapacitate a mage, rendering her completely helpless, and keep
  her that way for days or weeks. This level of flaw can serious
  injure a mage (five or six Health Levels), but will never kill
  her outright.
   </p>
   <p>
    Paradox can also permanently alter a mage. A Level 3 or 4 Flaw
  can manifest as a permanent flaw of minor, annoying sort (equal
  to Level 1). A Level 5 Flaw can manifest as a permanent flaw of a
  serious nature (equal to a Level 2 Flaw). If a mage gets hit with
  serious Paradox during an important part of your story, you may
  wish to stick them with a weaker but permanent Flaw so that they
  can continue on.
   </p>
   <p>
    Below are a list of possible Paradox Flaws, organized by
  Sphere and Level. Some of them are "coincidental" and others are
  not. Note that the duration of a Flaw can also affect its
  severity. A Level 2 backlash could manifest as a Level 1 Flaw
  that lasts for days, or a Level 3 Flaw that only lasts for a
  minute or two. The "standard" duration for a Flaw is a few hours,
  this can be lengthened to days or shortened to minutes. Level 4
  and 5 Flaws last longer; the standard duration is day, which can
  be shortened to hours, or lengthened to weeks.

     Correspondence:
    </h3>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 1
     </i>
     : The mage can only see behind himself for a few
  moments.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 2
     </i>
     : The mage's perception of space is altered for
  a few hours (objects in this mirror may appear to be closer than
  they actually are). The mage can still function, but may suffer
  +1 or +2 to his difficulty rolls for things that depend on his
  senses.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 3
     </i>
     : Objects in the mages possession gravitate to
  his left. His watch appears on his left hand, his wallet in his
  left pocket, etc. More significantly, any effect he casts will
  manifest several yards to the left of where he targeted it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 4
     </i>
     : The mage finds that he no longer can control
  direction. Anything she does will be targeted in a random
  direction. A spell she casts will have a randomly determined
  target, and she will walk in a strange sort of Brownian motion,
  with no control over her destination. The mage must be guided
  from one place to another.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 5
     </i>
     : The mage's body is turned inside out, flesh on
  the inside, organs on the outside, yet she mysteriously stays
  alive. This state is incredibly painful, and the mage can do
  nothing but writhe in agony until the effect passes.
     <br/>
    </p>
    <h3>
     Entropy:
    </h3>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 1
     </i>
     : The next feat the mage attempts fails
  automatically (don't bother to roll).
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 2
     </i>
     : Everything the mage sees is tinged with decay;
  not unlike the vision of wraiths. In addition to being rather
  depressing, it makes it difficulty for mages to judge the mood of
  people, and he has +2 to his difficulty for rolls like Empathy,
  Intimidation, Leader, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 3
     </i>
     : The mage finds that material objects become
  rotten and brittle under his touch. His equipment may break, or
  he may fall through holes in the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 4
     </i>
     : People in the vicinity of the mage will feel
  ill and out of sorts. Others will suffer a +1 penalty to the
  difficulty of any roll they have to make. The effect never seems
  to extend to the mage's enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 5
     </i>
     : The mage finds himself aging rapidly, at a
  rate of one year per minute. This continues for hours, yet the
  mage will not die, becoming a withered husk instead at about the
  age of 150 or so. The mage then returns slowly to normal, at a
  rate of 1 year per hour.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Forces:
    </h3>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 1
     </i>
     : The mage's hair stands on end, as if he were
  subject to static electricity. It goes away after a minute or
  two.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 2
     </i>
     : The mage's perception of the world changes, so
  that he sees everything in black and white.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 3
     </i>
     : For the next few hours, electrical devices
  fail to function within about 5 yards of the mage.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 4
     </i>
     : The mage finds herself floating one inch off
  the floor. This makes it very difficult to get anywhere, since
  the mage must pull herself along the walls and furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 5
     </i>
     : The mage is struck completely blind and deaf.
  Other forms of perceptual magick are ineffective as well. This
  can last for days.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Life:
    </h3>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 1
     </i>
     : The mage suffers from a sudden, violent muscle
  spasm, throwing her off balance.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 2
     </i>
     : The mage catches a nasty head cold. Between
  sneezing, watery eyes and headaches, the mage is at +1 difficulty
  to most rolls.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 3
     </i>
     : The mage finds that nearby plants grow at an
  alarming rate, especially if he is in direct contact with the
  plant.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 4
     </i>
     : One of the mage's limbs ceases to
  function.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 5
     </i>
     : The mage suffers from a violent epileptic
  seizure, that lasts for hours. It will take him days to
  recuperate.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Matter:
    </h3>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 1
     </i>
     : Whatever surface the mage is standing on
  becomes briefly slippery, causing him to fall.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 2
     </i>
     : One important piece of equipment (perhaps a
  Foci) breaks.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 3
     </i>
     : The mage finds himself unable to physically
  interact with some common substance (metal, wood, etc.); the
  material passes right through him. This can be quite embarrassing
  of the substance is clothe.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 4
     </i>
     : Any water the mage touches will freeze (large
  bodies of water only freeze within about a foot of the mage).
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 5
     </i>
     : The mage's body crystallizes. He can only move
  at a rate of one inch per minute, and magick becomes
  impossible.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Mind:
    </h3>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 1
     </i>
     : For the next few minutes, the mage speaks
  *exactly* what is on her mind, broadcasting her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 2
     </i>
     : The mage receives a lot of psychic static,
  random impressions from the minds of those around her. There is
  too much "noise" for the mage to learn anything useful, and the
  effect is rather distracting.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 3
     </i>
     : The mage finds that he has become a mental
  chameleon. He involuntarily adopts the mannerisms and personality
  of anyone with whom he spends more than a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 4
     </i>
     : The mage adopts some form of clinical
  insanity, such as a severe phobia of some nearby object, or
  paranoid delusions.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 5
     </i>
     : The mage's mental processes become completely
  jumbled, and he finds it impossible to form any coherent
  thought.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Prime:
    </h3>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 1
     </i>
     : The mage briefly "flashes" of magickal energy,
  so that his presence is easily perceived by any magickally aware
  being.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 2
     </i>
     : One of the rotes the mage is currently
  maintaining ceases to function.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 3
     </i>
     : All the Quintessence in a mage's pattern
  bleeds away.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 4
     </i>
     : The mage becomes a "magick magnet", and any
  effect cast in her vicinity will target the mage in addition to
  its normal target.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 5
     </i>
     : The mage looses touch with her Avatar, and is
  unable to perform any sort of magick for days (or weeks).
    </p>
    <h3>
     Spirit:
    </h3>
    <p>
     Most spirit paradoxes result in the manifestation of a Paradox
  spirit, or the spirit magick the mage is currently working goes
  horribly wrong. Other possibilities include having the mage shunt
  involuntarily into the Umbra, attracting malignant (non-paradox)
  spirits, or becoming a spirit herself for a period of time.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Time:
    </h3>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 1
     </i>
     : All the timepieces in the mage's area
  stop.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 2
     </i>
     : The mage's perception of time becomes
  disjointed, so that he sees everything one second into the
  future. He starts to answer questions before people have finished
  speaking. Alternately, the mage sees things one second into the
  past. It becomes more difficult to target people in the present
  (+1 or +2 to the difficulty).
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 3
     </i>
     : The mage suffers from time dilation, and can
  only act half as often as everyone else. Magick cannot counter
  this effect.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 4
     </i>
     : The mage looses his short term memory. He can
  only remember things that happened more than five minutes ago. He
  must act base only on his immediate perceptions.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Level 5
     </i>
     : The mage vanishes, only to reappear in the
  future, at some time of the storytellers choosing (though not
  more than a month or two later).
    </p>
    <hr>
     <h2>
      Paradox Rotes
     </h2>
     <p>
      Mages with a greater knowledge of Prime are able to control
  the Paradox in their pattern to a small degree, with the
  following rotes:
     </p>
     <h3>
      Induce Backlash (Prime 2)
     </h3>
     <p>
      Many mages choose not to wait for Paradox to strike, and
  deliberately induce a Paradox backlash on themselves, preferably
  while they are somewhere safe, like their sanctum. The strength
  of the backlash is still rolled randomly. No matter what the
  circumstances, this Rote always counts as Vulgar, even in the
  Umbra or in a mage's Sanctum. Thus, the rote always adds at least
  one point of Paradox to the mage's total pool. Heaven help the
  mage that botches this effect.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Controlled Backlash (Prime 4, or Prime 2 Entropy 2)
     </h3>
     <p>
      A more advanced version of the above rote, the mage has a
  greater degree of control over how much Paradox energy is
  released. For each success beyond the first, the mage can
  increase or decrease the strength of the backlash by one point.
  However, the mage still has no control over exactly how the
  Paradox manifests. This rote is also always Vulgar.
