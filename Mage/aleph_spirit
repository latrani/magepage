I don't know, noone ever said that reality is fault tolerant except on the
extreme scale.
A computer scientist can put up with a few inconsistent states as long as he
has a way of
trapping errors.

On a side note, I'd like to introduce people to one of the more nasty epiphs
out there who
occassionally moonlights as a Correspondance Paradox spirit:

Aleph (Correspondance)
Willpower 6, Rage 3, Gnosis 9, Power 25
Charms: Influence, Mind Speech, Airt Sense, Spirit Away, Perception=
 Recursion*
Description: Aleph, a high umbral spirit embodying the concept of an
infinity of=20
infinities is a rather strange spirit who has taken an undo interest in the=
=20
doings of humanity and mages in general. Aleph takes a seemingly malicious
joy in=20
confusing the perceptions and understandings of mages practising=
 Correspondance.
It concentrates its attacks on those mages who push the edges of=
 Correspondance,
such as attempting to be infinitely located, travelling an infinite=
 distance,
extend perception to infinite distances, shrinking perception to infinite
smallness
and other such limit pushing attempts.
        Its main attack is to spirit away the mage to a high Umbral realm of
the nature of infinities (possibly within himself) where it uses a
combination of
mind speech, influence, and its own power of perception recursion to confuse=
 the
mage with a series of seemingly Paradoxical questions about the nature of=
 space
and infinity.
        Some mages contend that Aleph is not in fact a Paradox spirit but
instead
an interested spirit that hopes to aid the enlightenment of mages in the=
 areas
of Correspondance. The confusion experienced by the mage is merely his own
inability
to grasp the highly esoteric concepts that Aleph is trying to convey to what
to it
must be an extremely alien entity (a finite one). In fact, certain Masters=
 of=20
Correspondance claim to have had great revelations in the field of
correspondance
after an experience with Aleph. Some even rumor that Aleph is in fact an
aspect of the
Oracles of Correspondance.

        *Perception Recursion: On a successful Gnosis roll against the
targets willpower
Aleph is able to convey a radically different sense of perception on the
character.
Extremely small objects appear impossibly huge, great distances are close
but short
distances extend beyond sight. Sight is linked to hearing, the loudest
noises are the
most distant ones and other impossibilities. Attempts to get an overview of=
 the
situation will have one suddenly focusing on a microscopic level. All senses
are affected
and linked. It is said that this is an attempt by Aleph to get the mage to
see the
true nature of correspondance.
