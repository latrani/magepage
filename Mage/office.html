   Office Thoughts

   They all scream for truth, the Truth - but I know the truth
  and it is cold and dead. Outside the bullet-proof windows the
  lights of the city burn far below. Above an aeroplane silently
  banks for landing, its lanterns blinking. My office is silent,
  dry and cold, completely independent of the climate and events
  outside thanks to clever insulating materials, climate control,
  intelligent heating systems and bullet-proof glass.

   As I turn from the window, the screensaver on my computer
  discreetly tones up the windows on the screen - in this place
  everything obeys me, even the least device is eager to please. A
  few messages have arrived, but my software agents are dealing
  with them; even my mail writes itself. Things happen as
  extensions of my Will, not because I order them but because they
  are in accordance with my goals.

   The last meeting with the other coordinators was strangely
  disturbing. The faces on the screens were familiar, but sometimes
  I felt as if they were empty masks, perhaps animated by AIs.
  Perhaps they were, I suspect that number 5 made the transition a
  long time ago (strange, I just can't remember his name, just the
  number of the monitor he always appears on).

   We discussed the agenda with the usual brisk efficiency, only
  to be bogged down with the question about Project Amsterdam. We
  argued about the funding and logistics, but from the beginning it
  was clear that this was a ritual, that the views and arguments
  were already defined. It was almost like we read from a script
  when Nakana demanded funding from sector AM, number 5 immediately
  pointed out that the collectives would delay the funding until
  they got the new fiscal plan and I responded that it could be
  transferred just like in 1978. We all knew what the others would
  say, like the actors in a well rehearsed play.

   "Power is the unit of all definition". Like my software agent
  I can't make heads or tails of the brief sentence in the
  anonymous email. It could be some kind of crank letter, but I
  doubt it. Another mental game from IC? I haven't heard from them
  in several years, something that I do not regret. Of all the
  groups I have to deal with, the ones who manipulate the
  manipulators have always struck me as the oddest. They spend most
  of their time inventing new ways of sneaking into minds of
  people, while they know someone, somewhere might do (or does) the
  same to them. They have even less free will than I do.
