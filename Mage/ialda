Subject: Re: The Apostles of Ialdabaoth

Here are the comments that bounced:
Something else that has occured to me about the apostles- the relation
between the fallen (or at least leaning over) mage and the avatar. The
avatar after all is a major influence in the drive for ascension and
abandoning the quest is going to (eventually) have fairly serious
reprocussions. So here are the two options that occur to me for how the
mage/avatar relationship could be affected.
The first is that the avatar accepts the mage slothfulness. This is
probably the prefered option for those who like avatars to be fairly
passive (or at least internal to the mage). The rational here is that the
mage's abandonment of ascension causes a similar listlessness to set into
the avatar. If the mage ever become interested in seeking ascension, the
the inertia of the avatar would have to be overcome- a seeking with no
guidance from the avatar would probably have to be the least of the mages
efforts.
The second option (and one I tend towards) is for those who see the avatar
as being more independant from the mage. Initially the avatar attempts to
cajole/ threaten  the mage back into action. Of course many mages in this
position resent such treatment so the result is just as likely to be the
two driven further apart as brought back together. After the avatar has
tried all its other options it may well choose to disassociate itselt from
the mage. This is a last ditch action to protect itself from being damaged
by the mages actions (or at least from wasting additional effort on a lost
cause). I would suggest that any mage in this position suffer similar
penalties to when their avatar has been taken away by rune-fetter
(something along the lines of + 3 to magic difficulties, unable to regain
prime [or similar]). To regain the avatar would be a fairly epic story, a
task which most mages in this position would be loath to undertake.
This leaves long-time Apostles as a somewhat unusual encounter for mages
trying to determine what exactly they are ("they seemed to be preforming
true magic, but I had no sense of an awakened avatar").
Of course the two options are not necessarily incompatible.
As a result of thinking about this I'm planning a posting (in a week or so,
depending on lunch breaks) on a mindscape/dreamrealm/rote/mediation/place
where mages can regain aspects from their past (such as regaining contact
with the avatar, or recalling lost [or stolen] memories). If  all goes as
planned I should post to both mage-l and the WW newsgroup (which on my
server has a turnover time of three days. I don't have time to check news
every three days, sigh) so you should catch it even if you do unsubscribe.
