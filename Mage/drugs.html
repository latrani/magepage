   Drugs In Mage

   "I in my grandeur have surpassed the sky and this vast Earth. I

  Mages have never been constrained by the morals of
  the sleepers, and have always explored realms far beyond mortal
  comprehension. One such area is the use of various drugs to alter
  perception, consciousness or reality itself. Mages have always
  been seeking ways to bring their visions to the unenlightened or
  help their followers to understand transcendent reality, and many
  have found drugs quite useful in this respect. While many mages
  have used various substances useful to their own magick and
  inspiration, most regard them as a bit of upaya (Sanskrit,
  "Skillful means"), simple tricks to help on the path to
  Ascension.

    <a name="Alamut">
     Alamut Black
    </a>
   </h2>
   This mixture was
  reputedly developed by Hassan i Sabbah (the founder of the
  Assassins) himself, and used for initiating members of the order
  or to achieve mystical insights. Since then the secret of its
  preparation has been handed down in the Cult of Ecstasy through
  generations, from mentor to disciple. It is almost pure hashish
  with a pinch of belladonna and stramonium (20:1:1). Like ordinary
  hashish it is hallucinogenic, but the visual imagery is much more
  brilliant and persistent; it has been likened to an episode of
  Quiet and allows the mage to seek hidden knowledge and
  illumination in his own mixture of reality and imagination.
   <h2>
    <a name="Nephente">
     Nephente
    </a>
   </h2>
   This drug was used in the
  Mediterranean during the Greek Era. It was probably a mixture of
  opium and a rare kind of lotus, and induced in its users a
  languid, pleasurable state of mind with an intense sensitivity to
  beauty. On the downside, it made its users passive and somewhat
  sluggish. It is believed it was used by both the Seers to gain
  insight into the aesthetics of the world and by the
   <a href="Mage/pythagoreans.html">
    Pythagoreans
   </a>
   to become able to experience the music of the
  spheres directly.
   <h2>
    <a name="Sacrament">
     The Sacrament of the Black
  Mother
    </a>
   </h2>
   This red-black elixir is made by the
   <a href="Mage/cult.html">
    Cult of the Final Ecstasy
   </a>
   . Its exact ingredients are not
  known, but are most certainly quite vile. Its effect is dramatic;
  it breaks down the will and rational mind of the imbiber,
  allowing the repressed sides to appear. During the influence
  (which can last for several days) the person will wander around
  in a daze, filled with strange emotions and visions (many latter
  describe the experience as being both dead and alive, surrounded
  by the immense presence of the frightening and comforting Black
  Mother). The Cult use this both as a way of controlling people
  and as an initiation rite; it is not uncommon for drugged people
  to gain deep insights in the ecstasies of life and death.
   <h2>
    <a name="Soma">
     Soma
    </a>
   </h2>
   This is a legendary drug of the
  tantrics of India, known since Vedic times, when it was often
  offered as a sacrifice to Indra and the other gods. It was made
  from a plant that originally grew in heaven but was brought to
  earth by a heroic eagle that planted it in the mountains. Wise
  men gathered it, pressed it between stones into a wooden bowl,
  filtered the juice through wool and finally sprinkled the soma
  with clarified butter. Today this sacred plant have become very
  rare, and only the tantrics know where to find it. Soma is said
  to give both health and immortality, and its users feel
  exhilaration and rapture at the beauty and power of the world.
  Some mystics even worshipped it as the creative power of God.
  Among the tantric mages it is used in the ceremonial preparations
  before sex magick, both as a sacrifice to Indra and Lakshmi, and
  to make their own union truly divine.
   <h2>
    <a name="Theta-norepinephrine">
     Theta-norepinephrine
  ("Crystal")
    </a>
   </h2>
   This drug was developed by the Progenitors
  and is currently marketed by the Syndicate. It is expected to
  become the new big designer drug, and currently the Mobsters are
  concentrating on spreading it among up-and-coming businesspeople
  and the jet set to give it the same air of glamour they gave
  cocaine. The drug (brilliant crystals which are placed beneath
  the tongue to dissolve, hence its nickname) stimulates the user
  and helps him handle stress better. This has some quite
  profitable results (from the perspective of the Syndicate): the
  user becomes more effective and thus can afford the drug without
  getting burned out, his improved results will entice others to
  try out Crystal, people slowly learn to cope with the fast pace
  of modern life but become dependent on the drug which the
  Syndicate controls - and the best part is that it doesn't cause
  any physiological or mental addiction, but since the users will
  have taken upon themselves an excessive workload they can't stop
  using it without getting hopelessly inefficient. It has a
  tendency to promote high blood pressure, ulcers, heart trouble
  and other stress related diseases in the long run, so the
  Progenitors foresee a huge market of their next generation of
  tranquillisers and relaxation methods.
   <h2>
    <a name="Dancing">
     The Dancing Powder
    </a>
   </h2>
   This powder is
  made from dried crushed spiders of the poisonous species Aranea
  Praegustator (common in most equatorial America). When ingested
  it causes hyperactivity, an inability to remain still (it is
  quite common for users to begin to dance uncontrollably) and
  ecstatic trance states. The drug is generally used to facilitate
  possession by spirits or gods, who enter the user and manifest
  through him.
   <h2>
    <a name="White">
     White Lightening
    </a>
   </h2>
   This is a very pure
  batch of LSD made by Richard Alpert in the 60's, (accidentally?)
  mixed with a small amount of Tass. Its effect on sleepers isn't
  unlike normal LSD, although it is much stronger and has the
  ability of giving visions of the Umbra. On mages it has very
  different effects; it focuses their inner vision towards
  Ascension and the total unity of space, time, matter,
  consciousness and the mage. The effect is quiet and gentle, but
  powerful as the movement of the planets themselves. When the
  Akashic Brotherhood found out about the batch after Alpert
  visited Tibet, they immediately acquired it from Alpert and made
  certain he would not spread it among the Cult of Ecstasy.
  Apparently they were fearful of the effects of the drug on
  untrained western minds, or they did not wish that the vision of
  Samadhi would be replicated by mere chemistry.
   <h2>
    <a name="Witches">
     Witches Ointment
    </a>
   </h2>
   This is an ancient
  Verbena concoction, consisting of fat from a sacrifice,
  belladonna, henbane and frog skin consecrated at a new moon. When
  applied to the genitals and anus it gives a feeling of drowsiness
  and vivid hallucinations. In this trance state it is much easier
  to send one's mind to remote places or worlds, giving rise to the
  myths about witches flying to the Sabbath on broomsticks.
   <h2>
    <a name="AUM">
     AUM
    </a>
   </h2>
   This drug was developed by the
  Erisian Liberation Front, a subgroup of the Discordians. It is a
  complex extract of hemp, RNA, heroin, cocaine and LSD. The heroin
  stills anxiety, RNA stimulates creativity, the hemp and LSD opens
  up the mind to joy and the cocaine stimulates thinking and
  activity. The net result is quite subtle, and not immediately
  apparent to the user. The long term effect seems to be an
  increase in "constructive gullibility", an extreme openness to
  new ideas and perspectives which allows the user to move from
  paradigm to paradigm. The Discordians try to give it to unknowing
  sleepers, attempting to turn them from neophobes to neophiles.
  The results are seldom predictable, sometimes the users go
  insane, sometimes they become creative and starts to develop
  their own ideas, sometimes they spontaneously awaken - but might
  join the Technocracy just as well as the Discordians. AUM is even
  more dangerous to mages, who risk slipping into marauderdom by
  its effects if they are not careful.
   <h2 class="c1">
    Poisons
   </h2>
   <h2>
    <a name="Hydra">
     Hydra Venom
    </a>
   </h2>
   This poison is sometimes
  used by the Euthanatos to bring the good death to especially
  worthy persons. It is a rare distillate of dozens of snake
  poisons gathered from the Shard Realm of Life, extremely toxic
  and virulent. As soon as it gets into the organism of someone, it
  will spread causing a burning agonising pain which only gets
  worse and worse. At the same time the victim becomes less
  affected by other kinds of pain, since they are so minor compared
  to the poison. Usually the victims commit suicide after a few
  hours of agony, releasing their souls from this incarnation.
   <h2>
    <a name="Lacrima">
     Lacrima Tenebris
    </a>
   </h2>
   This alchemical
  preparation (a slightly salty liquid, indistinguishable from
  tears) is made from lead salts, nightshade and tears from people
  in sorrow. By distilling and consecrating the solution on a
  Saturday, it will become filled with the powers of death and
  darkness. It can be mixed in food or drink, and will quickly
  induce a stupor followed by apparent death. In reality the
  preparation just freezes the bodily functions, and the victim is
  still alive and fully conscious in an almost total darkness with
  occasional glimpses of the surroundings. It is extremely hard to
  tell that the victim is alive, and most are simply assumed to be
  dead and buried.
   <h2 class="c1">
    Medicines
   </h2>
   <h2>
    <a name="Tetramethylhypnol">
     Tetramethylhypnol
    </a>
   </h2>
   This
  drug was developed by a research team led by Professor Heiselberg
  at the TAU construct to combat the effects of dreaming. It is an
  anti-hallucinogenic drug, which effectively inhibits all forms of
  dreaming during sleep. The drug makes its users rational and more
  connected to normal reality, draining away their creativity and
  imagination. Unfortunately the lack of dreaming also makes
  learning harder, and the unimaginative down-to-earth personality
  which emerges is actually not very suitable for the complex
  duties of technomancy. The drug is however widely used among
  field operatives and kamrads of Iteration X and the New World
  Order.
   <h2>
    <a name="Dr">
     Dr. Wilson's Radioactive Wonder
  Elixir
    </a>
   </h2>
   This mixture was devised around the turn of the
  century by a Son of Ether with a sense for business. He wanted
  both to help the sleepers and earn money, so he devised various
  more or less spurious medicines and wonder drugs. His Wonder
  Elixir was one of his most successful, mostly because it actually
  contains radioactive water (in addition to "animating and potent
  minerals and herbs") - so much in fact that a Geiger counter will
  give rather extreme readings around it. Despite the radioactivity
  it is without doubt extremely stimulating and completely
  non-addictive, and users report that it speeds up growth and
  improves their health quite a bit.
   <h2>
    <a name="SRA4I-23">
     SRA4I-23
    </a>
   </h2>
   SRA4I-23 (Serotenin
  Receptor A-4 Inhibitor 23) was developed by sleeper chemists, but
  has so far been suppressed by the Technocracy until they decide
  it is time to release it. It binds to the receptors in the
  pleasure centres of the brain, making it impossible to stimulate
  them by drugs of any kind. A user will not feel any cravings for
  alcohol, tobacco, other drugs or even chocolate during the
  effect. It also has the effect of decreasing the sex-drive and
  making the mood calm and positive. This drug could of course
  permanently solve many drug problems and become a tremendous
  weapon against the Cult of Ecstasy (as the NWO and some
  Progenitors wishes), but the Syndicate and the Pharmakopists
  aren't as thrilled. So far it has been mainly used within the
  Technocracy to ensure efficiency and dedication with very
  positive results.
