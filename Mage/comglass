Comglass.

What is it.

It's an entertainment system, a suveillance mechanism, and oddly enough,
a pane of glass.

        Comglass is made by ItX masters of matter and shipped for use by
the NWO.  Comglass is a very advanced piece of technology, consisting of
mane layers of substances, only molecules thick.
        Upon inspection, comglass looks like an ordinary sheet of glass,
with a small metal trim.  But comglass does many things.
        Foremost is comglass' senors.  Certain layers of the glass sense light
going through them.  Other layers that are just below the surface sense sound
striking either side.  The data from these layers is sent to one of the
"computer" layers, where is is processes and turned into a form that can be
broadcast to technomancer stations.  This, the NWO can see and hear whatever
happens in view and earshot of a sheet of comglass.
        Comglass can also absorb light.  To make this less conspicous, it
usually looks tinted.  However, the glass can be changed from opaque to
transparent if properly instructed.
        Comglass can make sound and produce video images.  The images are of
such high-quality that the human eye cannot tell the difference between the
image and the real thing.  These images can be see-through r be like normal
video images.

        Where is comglass used?
        Void Engineers and ItX'ers use it them for HUD's
        Progenitors and Syndicates use them as portable notepads.
        The NWO uses them for communications and espionauge.
        The Traditions don't use it, but you can be sure that doesn't
mean they aren't closer to some than they think.

Just another techno-idea.
