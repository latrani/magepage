OK, here are some suggestions:

1) To maintain a magickal paradigm, make up Rotes, Rotes, and more 
Rotes.  I strongly encourage every player to create several Rotes that 
are "theirs", that help define their personal magickal style.  I tend to 
give them breaks on things like fast casting and paradox when they are 
using "their" rotes.  I frown on them when they use Rotes from another 
tradition.  However, I encourage them to "translate" Rotes from one 
tradition to another.  This helps them concentrate on their magickal mind 
set.  Mind you, rules wise most of the Rotes for different traditions are 
exactly the same.  However, the props and methods needed to bring them 
about and the "reasons" behind why the Rote works change from Tradition 
to Tradition.

2) Have strong goals.  Mages should be dynamic beings, seeking to 
actively change the world, and as such should have strong and grandiose 
plans for their lives, both short and long term.  These goals should 
reflect the basic mindset of a mages paradigm, and should try to "push" 
reality in the right direction.  Constructive goals are preferable to 
destructive ones.  For example, a Verbena seeking to problem holistic, 
herbal healing within her community is doing more to promote her paradigm 
than a Verbena destroying the Technocracy.

3) Encourage "interdisciplinary" disputes between mages of different 
Traditions.  This is especially easy between the Techno-mages and the 
more fantastic mages, but can be especially interesting between two 
Techn-mages or between two fantastic mages.
