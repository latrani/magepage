   Shadow Moths

   Description
  </h2>
  These spirits are no bigger than the insects
  they resemble and rarely harm living creatures, but their
  presence in an area can be enough to terrify veteran
  technomancers and Euthanatos. Less experienced mages who think of
  all the inhabitants of the Deep Umbra as tentacled monstrosities
  often underestimate a swarm of black moths, but only once.
  <p>
   In their home realms Shadow Moths are just mindless scavengers
  that consume the remains of anything which has become too
  corrupted by entropy, and are probably eaten in turn by other
  entities. On Earth they can be devastating because a swarm will
  rapidly cover and absorb any object which is already tainted by
  entropy. Strangely, contact with Shadow Moths accelerates the
  rate at which entropy increases. The result is similar to a
  powerful Erode Matter (Entropy 3) effect as the moths land on the
  oldest or most decayed object in the vicinity and reduce it to
  dry powder before flying on to the next meal.
  </p>
  <p>
   Items with unusual amounts of Quintessence appear to be
  particularly attractive. Talismans are often the first target,
  especially if they use Entropy magicks or their physical form is
  weakening, but the traces of power which cling to Foci also make
  them choice morsels. Spirits and the living are safe unless they
  are severely corrupted, like terminal cancer patients, mages of
  Entropy and Fomori. If there is nothing more tempting in the
  vicinity then such beings will be engulfed and slowly absorbed.
  This is quite painless but does one die of aggravated damage per
  dot of Entropy or Taints that the victim possesses as the dark
  threads in their Pattern grow and the moths feast.
  </p>
  <p>
   Swarms do not have Traits as such because they don't do
  anything except eat and fly. Individual moths will be killed
  automatically by any attack which hits them, but they have good
  enough instincts to dodge (swatting a moth has a Difficulty of 9)
  and each swarm consists of several dozen. Entropy, Life and Mind
  magicks are probably useless, but Forces could be helpful, and
  sunlight repels them (although it does no damage). In most realms
  Paradox will stop the moths reproducing and totally annihilate
  them within hours.
  </p>
  <p>
   Not surprisingly, the more reckless and knowledgable Nephandi
  often consider using Shadow Moths against the Technocracy.
  However they can only be summoned in areas with a low Gauntlet by
  characters with the appropriate Lore, Spirit 2 and Entropy 1. A
  separate Spirit 4 effect is needed to actually control them, and
  without it the summoner is likely to become the first victim.
