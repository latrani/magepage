   Cult of Ecstacy Paradigm

   <h2>
    The Paradigm
   </h2>
   <b>
    The Experience
   </b>
   -- existence is a
  series of experiences that expand and change the immortal being
  within the Cultist. If a soul experiences every possible event,
  it is expanded to extra-human status.
   <h2>
    Magick
   </h2>
   <b>
    Whimsy
   </b>
   -- the will of the cultist is
  focused into creating more opportunities for experiences.
   <h2>
    Spheres
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <b>
      Time -- the Passage
     </b>
     . The Passage records the
    Experience in total, heals all wounds, overcomes all Bad
    Experiences (if any experience can be truly Bad, metaphysically
    speaking).
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Correspondence -- the Place
     </b>
     . One of the best ways to
    expand one's Experience is to change one's Place, or view
    another Place from afar, or merge many places into one more
    convenient location.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Entropy -- the Wild
     </b>
     . One of the best ways to improve
    the Experience, introduce a little Wild into something and
    watch the fireworks fly!
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Mind -- the Lie
     </b>
     . This is where the perceptions of
    the Experience are filtered and made palatable -- until the
    Cultist's Experience allows him to fully understand the Truth.
    The Doors of Perception must be Cleansed.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Prime -- The Whim, or The Will
     </b>
     (old form: Kia,
    Fiat). Through force of will, or sufficient Whimsy, the Cultist
    can accumulate Experience for later Whimsies, or transfer his
    Whim into material Whimsies.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Spirit -- the Truth
     </b>
     . This is where the Truth behind
    all things lies, the primal source of The Experience.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Pattern Magick -- the Art
     </b>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <b>
        Matter -- the Form
       </b>
       . Some vicarious Cultists seek
        to surround themselves with things of beauty, exploring
        experience at their leisure but vicariously. All things
        that can be created are done so with art and beauty in
        mind.
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        Life -- the Flesh
       </b>
       . The Experience of living
        things can be altered, but the Flesh holds the greatest
        promise.
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        Forces -- the Image, the Music, the Light and the
        Heat
       </b>
       . The Cultist can control the insubstantial as well
        as the substantial. Some modern Cultists also call this
        sight and sound, or audio-visual.
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h2>
    Arete
   </h2>
   <b>
    Whim
   </b>
   -- The Experience is to be warped and
  altered to the whim of the caster. The greater or more worthy the
  whim, the more likely The Experience will warp itself for the
  benefit of the Cultist. Old form: Kia, Fiat.
   <h2>
    Quintessence
   </h2>
   <b>
    Experience
   </b>
   -- somewhat synonymous
  with The Experience (i.e. the paradigm model itself), Cultists
  believe that Experience can be accumulated, making The Experience
  more knowable and therefore more changeable. Once a Whim has been
  enacted with the help of the Cultist's Experience, though, a new
  experience must be found to enact his next Whim.
   <h2>
    Paradox
   </h2>
   <b>
    The Bad Experience
   </b>
   -- screw with The
  Experience too much, and it turns Bad on you. Things go wrong,
  experiences and whims are warped and made evil, and eventually
  the Cultist is removed from The Experience entirely.
   <h2>
    Mage-specific Backgrounds
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <b>
      Arcane -- Charmed Life
     </b>
     . The more charmed one's life,
    the less likely to get in trouble from the authorities.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Avatar -- Passion
     </b>
     . Extremely passionate Cultists
    seem to absorb and pass on greater Experience than others.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Destiny -- Destiny
     </b>
     (as per the book). Some are even
    destined to have really Bad Experiences. That's cool. It
    inspires lesser Cultists to have courage and cleanse themselves
    of the good/bad distinction.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Dream -- Plumb the Passage
     </b>
     . All experiences are
    recorded in the Passage, and some Cultists can search it for
    "borrowed experiences" needed at a moment.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Node -- Diversion
     </b>
     . This is a place a Cultist can go
    to receive additional Experience that he can parlay into future
    Whims.
    </li>
   </ul>
