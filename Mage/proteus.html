   <h2>
    Proteus (Progenitor experiment / target of the
  Marauders)
   </h2>
   Deep within the Umbra, Proteus pulsated in
  pleasure. Dr. Kai had told it how helpful it had been in
  repulsing the last Marauder attack. Proteus still felt kind of
  giddy after consuming the "maniacs," as Dr. Kai called them, but
  "He" knew these were just feelings of pride and satisfaction.
  Everybody was always telling Proteus how useful "He" was, and how
  helpful "He" was, and Proteus beamed with joy....
   <p>
    In a swirling spiral of chocolate pudding/blood soaked
  uranium, a band of huddled figures sat in a circle screaming.
  They screamed for the time when their flesh would overpower the
  will of their Ram, and they would have "Him" to use against the
  Masters of the Wall. In their last attack, they had managed to
  infect the Ram with one of their members, his thoughts beginning
  to invade its mind. Their screaming would soon be over....
   </p>
   <hr>
    <b>
     Background:
    </b>
    Proteus was conceived (so to speak) in the
  late 1960's by the Progenitors in an attempt to create a creature
  whose every body cell was linked in a "hive mind" with every
  other. The Progenitors hoped to use their "Protean Flesh Idea" in
  order to allow instantaneous tissue regeneration and resculpture,
  by having the flesh take whatever form the host body (which would
  have dominance over the hive mind) willed it to. The Flesh was
  designed to survive off of free floating quintessence, and could
  grow when exposed to more concentrated amounts.
    <p>
     In 1975, the first cell of Proteus was created. The
  Progenitors began experiments in manipulating the tissue using
  the Mind and Life spheres. In 1978, Proteus filled a small
  warehouse. Despite Syndicate arguments about cost efficiency,
  Proteus was moved to the Umbra for further growth and study. In
  1982, Proteus developed sentience, formed a mouth and spoke. The
  Technocracy didn't know what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Progenitors called in Iteration X (which had used the
  Protean Flesh Idea experiments as the inspiration for their HIT
  Mark VI, and a movie to prepare the masses for the new
  technology) for some initial help. Since the Progenitors had
  already made a profitable deal with MECHA, trading clones and
  tissue coating cyborgs for quintessence, the members of Iteration
  X were quick to help with containment/termination equipment that
  would work on Proteus. Also, the Void Engineers offered vast
  amounts of quintessence for Proteus, hoping to use Protean Flesh
  to bioengineer life usable on other planets and in the void of
  space. Even though the Progenitors quickly managed to get a grasp
  of the situation, the New World Order and Syndicate were
  demanding that the project be put on hold. The Void Engineers,
  still recovering from the Challenger explosion, decided not to
  challenge the NWO/Syndicate and limited their aid to donations of
  quintessence.
    </p>
    <p>
     The decisive moment came in the winter of 1982, when Proteus
  destroyed an entire Ahriman of Nephandi mages and a small horde
  of their creatures. When the Technocracy heard of the immense
  power of Proteus they relented, designating "Him" as a "secret
  weapon" of sorts. While the Progenitors felt Proteus' loyalty
  secure, the Syndicate and the New World Order feared the power of
  this construction even more. While the Protean Flesh was a
  reality, it had been discovered that the flesh was useless once
  detached from Proteus, ever since the creature had gained self
  awareness, and also, Proteus could not leave the Umbra without
  suffering Paradox.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, the Syndicate had also discovered that Proteus had
  become the largest battery of Quintessence in existence. While
  Proteus absorbed huge amounts of raw and free quintessence from
  MECHA and the VE donations, the Syndicate had discovered that the
  flesh could also be converted back into quintessence. The
  Syndicate has since been looking for a way to not only debunk
  Proteus (the new name for the Protean Flesh Idea), but also to
  secretly claim the thing so they can tap its power.
    </p>
    <p>
     The New World Order has been called in to make sure the
  creature not only is kept firmly under Technocracy control, but
  also to make sure that no other mage faction can persuade it to
  defect. The New World Order was also responsible for "maintaining
  the mind frame" of Proteus (while they claim to be studying and
  maintaining "His" mental health, they are also trying to
  brainwash Proteus into answering only to the NWO), but haven't
  been able to ascertain the source of Proteus' recent minor mental
  aberrations (which they believe to be caused by the stress of
  their "reprogramming," an activity they will not cease).
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, Proteus is a Progenitor's dream come true. Proteus
  is able to mimic any sequence of DNA it is exposed to, and it can
  (given sufficient information or inspiration) simulate the effect
  of any conceivable change to the DNA code. Proteus has been
  exposed to every mundane creature found on Gaia, including all
  members of the plant and animal kingdoms, as well as all mundane
  microorganisms. Proteus has been used to by the Progenitors to
  develop cures for Cancer, AIDS and every other disease known to
  modern science. However, the Progenitors are extremely cautious
  about introducing "nonterrestrial" life forms to Proteus, fearing
  what effect an Umbral creature or virus might have on Proteus.
  Due to this fear, Proteus constantly rejects any attempt from
  unapproved organisms to invade it's cellular structure. Proteus
  works with the Progenitors, helping them learn in leaps and
  bounds. This has created an intense master-pet form of bonding
  between Proteus and its Progenitor "parents".
    </p>
    <p>
     In fact, Proteus was deemed so valuable by the heads of the
  Progenitor Convention that they made sure Proteus wasn't as
  tightly controlled or restricted as "He" should be. The heads
  were interested in watching how Proteus would develop with (a
  small amount of) self determination. However, the Progenitors
  have also developed a way to cause Proteus to "dissolve" should
  "He" defect from the Technocracy or be deemed too great a threat
  by the Progenitor leaders.
    </p>
    <p>
     Two other groups have a vested interest in Proteus; a group of
  Marauders, and a Technocracy Oracle. Both have realized an
  amazing feature of Proteus; since every cell in Proteus is self
  aware and linked to every other cell via a hive mind, Proteus
  alone could define the reality of Gaia. However, since Proteus
  exists in the Umbra (a place where reality is much more fluid),
  "He" cannot define reality on Gaia. Also, the Oracle and
  Marauders will not tell anyone of this feature. In the Oracle's
  case, she fears the repercussions this would have through out the
  Technocracy as every Convention tried to seize control of it,
  leading to a civil war in the Technocracy. The Marauders, on the
  other hand, intend to "infect" the hive mind of Proteus with
  their own minds, take "Him" to Gaia, and force reality to accept
  not only the chaos of the Marauders, but also the existence of a
  giant blob of tissue.
    </p>
    <p>
     While the Nephandi would like to corrupt Proteus, they either
  assume "He" is too indoctrinated into Technocracy beliefs (not
  true), or that "He" is constantly monitored by the Technocracy
  (
     <em>
      very
     </em>
     true). However, some Nephandi have decided to try
  to corrupt Proteus, only to be attacked by Marauders almost as
  soon as the Nephandi begin their plotting.

     <b>
      Amalgams:
     </b>
     Psychological Diagnostics, Cellular Monitors,
  and Protean Flesh Experiments are the three main technomancer
  cabals who work at/with/in Proteus and answer to the
  Representatives.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Psychological Diagnostics:
    </h3>
    <b>
     Members:
    </b>
    Harold Smith
  (NWO, Adept); Janice Smith (NWO, Master); Maxwell Brown (NWO,
  Master); Eric Thompson (Progenitor, Master)
    <p>
     The Psychological Diagnostic team is responsible for recording
  Proteus' mental development, and counseling Proteus about what
  "He" should do. The members of Psychological Diagnostics (with
  the exception of Eric), are trying to secretly gain control over
  Proteus and steal him to the NWO. Should Eric find out about
  this, he will immediately inform the other Progenitors, causing
  the New World Order mages to be expelled from the project (and
  creating intense conflict between the two conventions).
    </p>
    <h3>
     Cellular Monitors:
    </h3>
    <b>
     Members:
    </b>
    Carlos Rodriguez
  (Progenitor, Master); Alison Hendricks (Progenitor, Adept); Ian
  (Progenitor, Adept)
    <p>
     The Cellular Monitors are one of two amalgams dedicated solely
  to the study of Protean Flesh, and Proteus. The Cellular Monitors
  study the ability of Protean Flesh to be altered, are responsible
  for introducing cell samples for creatures "new" to Proteus, and
  catalogue the unique cellular creations Proteus designs in
  "Himself." The Cellular Monitors have found a few scattered cells
  that seem to be in the early stages of developing their own
  personality. The Progenitors and Proteus can't wait to see how
  these "buds" will turn out.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Protean Flesh Experiments:
    </h3>
    <b>
     Members:
    </b>
    Patricia
  Goldstein (Progenitor, Master); Benjamin Matthews (Progenitor,
  Master); Emily Campbell (Progenitor, Adept); Lucas Steed
  (Progenitor, Adept)
    <p>
     The Protean Flesh Experiments team is responsible for trying
  to find a way to graft Protean Flesh onto other organism while
  retaining its metamorphic properties. The PFE is also trying to
  find a way to allow Proteus to "break" into multiple parts, with
  each part staying alive and connected to the hive mind. So far,
  both projects have ended in failures, but with Proteus' ever
  eager assistance, the PFE believes they are close to a
  breakthrough.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Representatives:
    </h3>
    <b>
     Members:
    </b>
    Dr. Kai (Progenitor,
  Master); Kyle Vandenburg (Progenitor, Master)
    <p>
     The Representatives are responsible for reporting to the other
  conventions of the Technocracy, and coordinating the other
  amalgams working with Proteus. The Representatives area also in
  charge of negotiating with Proteus into doing the bidding of the
  Technocracy, including commanding it to attack enemies' horizon
  realms. However, since Proteus has expressed a desire to abstain
  from violence, the Representatives have been forced to allow the
  New World Order to "reprogram" "His" mind into a more submissive
  state.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Environment:
     </b>
     The technomancers working with Proteus,
  also work
     <em>
      inside
     </em>
     of Proteus. Proteus is a self
  sufficient "realm." Proteus recycles oxygen by taking the
  technomancers carbon dioxide, and mimicking artificial plant
  cells. Water is recycled from fluid wastes and also brought by
  the Progenitors from Gaia to test how various
  creations/modifications of Proteus' cell structure will react in
  an aqueous environment. The only feature the Progenitors need to
  supply is their own food.
    </p>
    <p>
     Proteus can even mimic weather patterns within itself,
  including rain, hurricane strength winds, and tornadoes, by
  forming various orifices and moving water form one location
  inside itself to another. Proteus can
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     duplicate
  lightning, or snow/hail, but is trying to develop means by which
  it can do both. Proteus provides light by synthesizing
  phosphorescent fungi across its interior, and other cellular
  creations of its own design.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Denizens:
     </b>
     Besides the Technocracy members, their
  attendant guards (mainly Dracoforms and Superiors), and various
  experimental organisms, Proteus is completely devoid of life.
  Occasionally a creature will wander towards Proteus, but "He"
  will quickly dispatch it (either by scaring it off, or killing it
  if the creature persists) in order to prevent "unauthorized alien
  cell explosion."

    <b>
     Other Details:
    </b>
    Proteus should be considered a
    <em>
     huge
    </em>
    quintessence battery. Each of "His" cells was
  formed from pure quintessence, and each can be turned back into
  quintessence. A pound of Protean Flesh holds 5 points of
  quintessence. Since Proteus was last estimated (in 1985) to weigh
  over 2000 tons, "His" current Quintessence value is unknown. Only
  the Syndicate, and the Technomancer Oracle known as Dr. Hendricks
  are aware of this fact.
    <p>
     Only the Marauders and Dr. Hendricks know of the potential
  Proteus holds to shaping reality. Both groups work to insure this
  remains unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
     The most interesting feature of Proteus is the fact that "He"
  is
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     a true horizon realm. While Proteus is powered by
  quintessence, "He" is also self aware and able to mimic the
  effects of magickal spheres. Since Proteus only
     <em>
      allows
     </em>
     "Himself" to be altered according to the Progenitors' wishes, and
  also changes "Himself" at will (a fact which they are well aware,
  but not resenting of), he has not, at the present, been
  classified as a horizon realm. Debates rage among both the
  Progenitors and even the Void Engineers over this topic. Also of
  interest is Proteus' ability to channel free quintessence from
  the Umbra! Only Dr. Hendricks knows of this, and even she has no
  idea how it's accomplished. However, the Syndicate is beginning
  to suspect Proteus is capable of something like this.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Construct Description:
     </b>
     Trying to describe Proteus is
  nearly impossible. Proteus can change shape at will, form
     <em>
      any
     </em>
     lifeform found on Gaia (or a part of any lifeform)
  anywhere on/in "Himself." However, Proteus is limited in that
  "He" has a certain amount of mass and density he must always
  possess, and "He" seems unable to completely mimic another
  lifeform like a chimera, or a Master of Life can.
    </p>
    <p>
     Currently, Proteus has chosen to take the form of a giant
  sphere (a mile in diameter), covered in purple and yellow fish
  scales. Proteus forms openings, sensing minds and seeing through
  millions of microscopic sensory organs, for those who are
  permitted access or those "He" is told to admit by the
  Representatives. Proteus used to resemble a gray-white lump of
  tissue, but has since decided that "He" would much rather take a
  multitude of forms, but remains somewhat consistent for the
  technomancers' benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Proteus' interior is a collection of corridors and rooms
  formed when "He" hollows them out to provide access for the
  Progenitors. Proteus has created multitudes of "testing rooms"
  mimicking every environment on Gaia from oceans to deserts
  (tundras and colder climes are created with the aid of Iteration
  X technology, since Proteus can not, at present create cold).
  Progenitors bring lifeforms into Proteus for Proteus to
  experiment upon, and to test how new organisms will adapt to
  their changes. Rooms also exist that the Technocracy uses as
  auditoriums, storage, and bedchambers. Most of the items inside
  Proteus, are formed by "Him" and connected to "Him" as well, but
  some items (like technology, food, and books for example) have to
  be imported.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Chantry Inhabitants:
     </b>
     Besides the mages who live full
  time inside Proteus, there are no other native life forms to be
  found. Various Progenitor guardians and experiments can be found
  living inside Proteus and occasionally assemblies of Progenitors
  will use Proteus as a meeting hall of sorts, a factor which has
  gained much prestige for the Construct. Also, Proteus has been
  used as a storing area for Superiors and other clones in times of
  need, but this is rare.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Internal Structure and Relations:
     </b>
     All of the
  Progenitors answer to the Representatives, who in turn answer to
  the heads of the Progenitor convention and then the other heads
  of the Technocracy (in that order). The members of the New World
  Order answer to the Representatives as well, but their true
  loyalties are with their own convention, and they would readily
  turn on their Progenitor "allies" if so ordered. Proteus is well
  liked by the Progenitors, who dote over it like a person would
  their favorite pet. The Progenitors have formed a strange, loving
  bond with their giant creation; a bond which Proteus has formed
  with them as well. The New World Order feign affection as well,
  but see Proteus as only a tool. While the Progenitors are aware
  of this deception on the part of the NWO, they have yet to
  convince Proteus that anyone would only pretend to be "His"
  friend.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, the heads of the Progenitors could, and would, demand
  Proteus' destruction, should "He" attempt to defect. And such an
  order would be obeyed by the Convention as a whole.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      External Relations:
     </b>
     The various mages that work with
  Proteus are isolationistic for the most part. The Representatives
  occasionally allow new members from the Progenitors to join them,
  and the Other Conventions of the Technocracy are allowed to visit
  as well. The Syndicate is treated with apathy however, due to
  their continual demands that funding for Proteus be canceled, and
  the project disbanded. Non-Technocracy mages are seen as enemies,
  and dispatched immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Status and Reputation:
     </b>
     Within the Progenitor's
  Convention, Proteus is the crown jewel. Being selected to work
  with Proteus is deemed as one of the highest honors that a
  Progenitor could receive. All other Conventions see Proteus as a
  respectable project (due to it's use as a weapon), but not
  anything to get too excited about.
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Status: 3 (5 for Progenitors)
     </li>
     <li>
      Reputation: 2 (5 for Progenitors)
     </li>
    </ul>
    <b>
     Policy Regarding Outsiders:
    </b>
    The members of Proteus
  are, for the most part, isolationistic. They have orders to
  report
    <em>
     any
    </em>
    Technocracy members who try to enter/approach
  Proteus to the Representatives, who will check their records and
  see if the heads of the Conventions have cleared such a meeting
  in
    <em>
     advance.
    </em>
    As such, the members of Proteus know who to
  expect and who not. Any unexpected visitors will be destroyed
  immediately.
    <p>
     Visiting Progenitors can expect the full tour, as the mages
  try to show off their giant assistant. All other Technocracy
  Conventions can expect a cool reception, unless they express
  interest in Proteus as something more than a weapon or tool. If a
  technomancer shows (real or not) interest in Proteus' biological
  applications, than he can also expect a full tour.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Allies and Enemies:
     </b>
     The members of Proteus could call
  on
     <em>
      any
     </em>
     other Progenitors for assistance at any time.
  Also, the Progenitors have made several deals with MECHA and the
  Void Engineers. Then there is the Oracle, Dr. Hendricks, who is
  secretly trying to turn Proteus into a more compassionate being
  (she was the one who convinced Proteus not to indiscriminately
  destroy everyone the Technocracy told him to).
    </p>
    <p>
     The Syndicate would love nothing more than to drain Proteus of
  "His" vast quintessence reserves, and cut funding to a project
  which seems to hold no financial profit. An Umbrood known only as
  Appleseed has discovered Proteus and intends to kill "Him" for
  reasons unknown. Currently, the largest threat towards Proteus is
  a large gathering of Marauders who have decided to "infect" the
  organism's hive mind with their own insane thought patterns and
  use Proteus to destroy the Technocracy's paradigm on Gaia.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Research Capabilities:
     </b>
     In the fields of life sciences,
  cellular biology, etc., the Technocracy has nothing better than
  Proteus, who can mimic cell patterns/organisms "He's" been
  exposed to, and create new ones that are totally unknown. The New
  World Order also has advanced equipment and training dealing with
  "unusual" lifeforms, and NWO members are sent to Proteus to
  develop their skills in such techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Nodes:
     </b>
     Proteus is supplied by absorbing free
  quintessence from VE quintessence gathering probes, and by steady
  quintessence supplies from MECHA. Beyond that, Proteus has no
  access to any other nodes. Even if MECHA were to cut off it's
  supply to Proteus (unlikely, since the Progenitors of Proteus are
  responsible for MECHA's more biological needs), Proteus has found
  a way to tap into quintessence in the Deep Umbra, and could
  survive off of the quintessence floating freely there (a fact
  Proteus "Himself", is unaware of).
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Stories:
     </b>
     Stories involving Proteus have two themes and
  moods, depending on who is involved. For Progenitors, the
  predominant theme of stories involving Proteus is similar to a
  "parent-child" or "boy-dog" story. Proteus and the Progenitors
  work together with great compassion and even friendship for each
  other. Whereas the Progenitors would have little compassion
  towards a test animal (or human), they make up for their
  cold-heartedness towards Proteus. The mood for Proteus/Progenitor
  stories is one of joy, where they make great breakthroughs
  together, and have developed a strong bond.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the other hand, for the New World Order/Syndicate, the
  theme of stories using Proteus revolve around both Conventions
  desires to steal Proteus from the Progenitors without letting
  their allies learn of the deception. In short, the theme is one
  of plotted betrayal, and the mood is cold, calculating and
  ruthless. Both the NWO and the economancers suspect the other's
  interest in Proteus, so they both move carefully and slowly, not
  wanting to tip their hand to the other.

    <ol>
     <li>
      A group of Tradition mages learn of the existence of
    Proteus from a renegade Progenitor who can only speak in awe of

    Tradition mages would be interested in seeing this giant pet of
    the Progenitors. Time for some recon.....

      A group of Technocracy mages have been sent to Proteus to

     Background:
    </b>
    Dr. Kai is an enigma. He was appointed by
  the Progenitor Convention heads as one of the two Representatives
  for Proteus after spending two decades serving the Progenitors
  faithfully. He has expressed deep interest in Proteus, and aids
  his fellow Progenitors in their research. Over all, Dr. Kai is a
  well respected member of the group, and Proteus always listens to
  what Dr. Kai has to say.
    <p>
     Dr. Kai has a secret. While he is a member of the Progenitors,
  it was the Syndicate that initially recruited him because of his
  successful opium dealings with the Golden Triangle. When the
  Syndicate discovered Dr. Kai's skill with drug designing, and his
  knowledge of biochemistry, the Syndicate manipulated events so
  that the Progenitors would notice the Doctor, and take him in
  while he retained his ties to the Syndicate as a sleeper
  agent.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dr. Kai has another secret. He's not going to turn Proteus
  over to the Syndicate. He's going to set Proteus free, and allow
  "Him" to escape all the powerplays of the Technocracy and give
  him the freedom to choose his own path in existence (something
  even the other Progenitors would disagree with).

     Dr. Kai is an Asian man, who looks to be in his
  early fifties. He stands about five foot, eight inches tall, with
  an average frame. He typically dresses in white suits, wearing a
  white lab coat on top. He always seems to be controlled, and
  calculating his next move, while at the same time presenting a
  caring figure towards his fellow scientists.

      Role-Playing Notes:
     </b>
     Proteus is impressive. Everybody
  wants "Him." Nobody cares what "He" wants. Except you. You do
  care about the Technocracy, especially the Syndicate that found
  you, and the Progenitors who accepted you. Once you wouldn't have
  given a damn, but that was long ago, before you saw Proteus. Now
  you care about something more than yourself. You think of it as a
  second chance.

     Background:
    </b>
    Doctor Patricia Hendricks was a brilliant
  chemical engineer who was working on "genetic-altering" drugs.
  Her brilliance was soon noted by the Progenitors, who brought her
  in to their fold (stealing her from both the Sons of Ether and
  the Cult of Ecstasy, who had both been watching her for a while.)
  Patricia soon raised in their ranks, and was instrumental in
  Proteus' creation. As Patricia watched Proteus grow, she began to
  gain a deeper understanding of the universe. When Proteus
  achieved sentience, Patricia was approached by the Oracles, and
  joined their ranks.
    <p>
     After her ascension, Patricia continued to watch Proteus.
  While she felt like a mother towards "Him," she knew that others
  in her old convention would not, so she began to alter their
  feelings, making them grow attached to her "child." Someday she
  hopes that Proteus will realize "His" potential in shaping
  reality on Gaia. In that moment, the Progenitors will win the
  ascension war, and
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     the Technocracy. And she, with
  Proteus' help, will see that humanity is raised up from the
  Masses and that they too will ascend.

     A dazzling woman, even without magickal
  alterations, Dr. Hendricks stands at almost six feet in height.
  While her body is in good shape, she has used extensive magicks
  to alter her attributes to extreme levels. Dr. Hendricks wears
  loose-fitting outfits with lots of pockets (to store equipment
  and other trinkets). She tends to keep her flame red hair up, and
  people tend to feel her nurturing warmth when around her.

      Role-Playing Notes:
     </b>
     You like your friends, and don't
  ever want to leave them. Sometimes you wonder if they really like
  you or not, so you try all the harder to make them happy.
  Occasionally you wonder why the people in the black suits are
  only "pretending to be your friend" (as the Progenitors say), and
  why you keep hearing voices screaming when you let yourself sleep
  and dream.
