   Hollow One Paradigm
  </h1>
  <h5>
   By Stayne
  </h5>
  <hr>
   NOTE: There is a specific reason why the topics listed are by a
  matterialistic definition, and not a philosophical one. While the
  traditions and conventions would see things in terms of Magick
  and science, the Hollow ones would, in my opinion, see things
  more on how they are used, not the absolute meaning.
   <h2>
    The Paradigm
   </h2>
   <b>
    The Game
   </b>
   : Life is a game, so we may
  as well enjoy it. The object of the game, is to see who can cause
  the most problems, have the most fun, and in the long run, who's
  the coolest.
   <h2>
    Magick
   </h2>
   <b>
    Playing
   </b>
   : Magick is how we play the game.
  Use it to alter things, wipe out your enemies, or just to have
  fun. Magick is also useful for profit and relieving boredom.
   <h2>
    Spheres
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <b>
      Correspondence: Cheap travel
     </b>
     . Correspondance is a
    good way to avoid having to take the buss, or bum a ride. It's
    also a way to spy on people, and if used right, produces some
    nice hallucination like effects.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Entropy: Decay and Rot
     </b>
     . In the end, this is what it
    all comes down to. Everything decays and rots away, leaving you
    alone, tired and bored. However, you can use it to ruin
    everyone elses day too, so enjoy.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Forces: Shock treatment
     </b>
     . Need to really ruin
    someone's day? Smack 'em with forces. It's a usefull way to
    screw around with things, and it can even make a few nice
    effects. If you know enough about it that is.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Life: Life
     </b>
     . Well, life is life. Change it, play with
    it, do whatever you want with it. It's amusing, but in the end
    it always dies. Don't grow too atached to it.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Matter: Toys
     </b>
     . Matter is the cheapest toy shop on
    earth. You need something? Make it out of nothing. Hell, it's
    even fun sometimes.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Mind: Neurosis and Psychosis
     </b>
     . Everyone's at least a
    little crazy, so there's no harm in making them crazier.
    Although if you like you can make 'em saner. Of course, you
    have to be at least a little crazy to mess with someone elses
    mind.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Prime: Essence
     </b>
     . The absolute base ingredient of
    everything. This is no play thing, it's more to be respected
    and handled carefully. If you fuck this up, you can create some
    really bad effects.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Spirit: Death
     </b>
     . The Spirits of the dead don't go to
    heaven or hell. They end up hanging around doing nothing.
    Although I'm sure they have games of some kind. This is how you
    deal with them. If you're good, you can even be one for a
    while.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Time: Cheap watches
     </b>
     . Time's pretty cool. You can use
    it to do a lot of weird shit. Namely seeing into the past and
    future. Those are the big uses, although it can also be used to
    play with things a bit.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h2>
    Arete
   </h2>
   <b>
    Coolness
   </b>
   . How cool you are, and how much you
  play with the world define what you can do. Basically meaning, if
  you are a dork, you're going to stay that way. While if you're
  cool, you can only get better.
   <h2>
    Quintessence
   </h2>
   <b>
    Amusement
   </b>
   . The more amused one is,
  the more they can do. If you're really depressed say, and you try
  to fry your MiB friend with a lightning-bolt, it probably won't
  work. On the other hand, if you're having a good time, or even
  better, you're intoxicated, you can blast him and it'll be great.
   <h2>
    Paradox
   </h2>
   <b>
    Fucking up
   </b>
   . In the great game of life and
  reality bending, when you fuck up it shows. Even worse, the
  fuck-up squad (Paradox Spirits) might just show up to roast you.
  It's best to not fuck up.
   <h2>
    Mage-specific Backgrounds
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <b>
      Arcane: Lack of popularity
     </b>
     . If no one knows who you
    are, it tends to create problems. On the other hand, it's
    harder for the mirrorshades to find you, wich has it's
    benifits.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Avatar: Subconscience
     </b>
     . Your subconscience is the
    root of all you're powers, so you'd better listen to it when it
    speaks up.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Chantry: Hang out
     </b>
     . Everyone needs a hangout, it may
    as well be some place cool.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Destiny: Delusions of Granduer
     </b>
     . It might be a
    delusion, but then again, Alexander the Great had delusions of
    granduer too. Look what it got him.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Dream: Messages
     </b>
     . Sometime your subconscience needs
    to talk to you, this is how it happens.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Node: Entertainment
     </b>
     . Your hang out has to have
    something entertaining or cool about it, this is that coolness.
    You can not deny that the weird ways Quint comes up are
    cool.
    </li>
