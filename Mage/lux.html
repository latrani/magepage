  <h1>
   Lux Aeterna and the Nunti
  </h1>
  Another legacy of the
  <a href="Mage/acol_logos.html">
   Acolytes of the Logos
  </a>
  was the formation of the chantry Lux
  Aeterna in Tuscany. This chantry is one of the major European
  centres for hermetic and religious magick, and it still holds
  strict to many of the ideals of the Acolytes: magick should only
  be used for spiritual purposes or to move mankind towards God,
  mages should live a humble and ascetic life preferably in
  monastic seclusion, dealings with mages denying these tenets are
  expressibly forbidden. Despite its well deserved reputation of
  being one the most conservative chantries of Europe, it is also
  extremely well renowned for its learning, the quality of its
  education, the fabled library (containing many medieval texts
  saved by the Acolytes during the renaissance) and the wise
  council of the nunti, special envoys sent to other chantries or
  traditions on diplomatic missions.
  <p>
   The nunti (who have been called the Jesuits of the traditions)
  are probably the sharpest diplomats among the traditions, often
  able to convince other mages of the righteousness of certain
  actions or views. In one famous debate in 1893 in London,
  Richardo Derrida of Lux Aeterna elegantly annihilated the
  arguments from several representatives from the New World Order
  before an audience of Sons of Ether and probably helped sow a
  seed of rebellion inside the convention. The nunti are
  universally recognisable among tradition mages (at least those
  who have paid some attention to history) by their seal, usually
  worn on a medallion around the neck: a golden octagram, with the
  Hebrew letter Aleph in the centre (representing the power of the
  Logos shining through the physical world revealing the
  message).
  </p>
  <p>
   The chantry proper is surprisingly discreet, a renaissance
  building complex incongruously located on a small hill in the
  middle of the countryside surrounded by flowering fields.
  Officially it belongs to the Instituto Camplani, a little known
  think-thank. However, on the inside certain doors open up to its
  Horizon realm, a medieval monastery located on an identical hill
  in the same landscape. The chapel contains several famous relics
  believed to have been lost through the ravages of time, including
  the flame known as Lux Aeterna, which is believed to date back to
  the holy flame of the Temple.
