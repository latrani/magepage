     History:
    </b>
    Garath was once a minor demon of Hades,
  toiling to corrupt the Earth and bring about Satan's final
  victory on Judgement Day (not really). But one day, Garath
  stopped a mortal's suffering prematurely, and was cast out of
  Hell. Arriving in the mortal plane, his spirit took on a man's
  shape. (again, not really) With his falling from daemonic favor,
  the realization came to Garath that he might rise back into
  angelic favor, and become the way he was when Eden was new and
  Adam and Eve still uncorrupted. (No, he wasn't really around
  then) So Garath took up a crusade to protect the innocents of the
  Earth from his former brethren and to insure the eventual
  Ascension of mankind on the day of Judgement. And on that
  Judgement Day, if he has done well enough, he will be returned to
  his original place at the side of Christ. (No, that won't ever
  happen. You should realize this history is fiction by now!)
   </p>
   <p>
    In reality, Garath was just a poor young man who was to be
  sacrificed by a Satanic cult. The trauma of being tied to a black
  altar, surrounded by crazed cultists was enough to awaken his
  powerful sleeping Avatar. A blast of pure Forces took care of the
  Satanists. But his mind had snapped in the process of Awakening,
  and he was born a Marauder. Since then, he has gone on a crusade
  against everything with the slightest taint of demons or the
  Wyrm. He was gained a massive amount of knowledge concerning the
  denizens of the World of Darkness, and has a mastery of Forces
  approaching that of an Oracle. In fact, the Oracles of Forces are
  considering asking him to join them.
   </p>

    <b>
     Quiet:
    </b>
    Guess what? Garath thinks he a former demon who
  can get back into heaven. That's his basic level of Quiet. At
  higher levels, he begins to see demons and/or angels where there
  is really nothing or he begins to see normal people as evil
  beings. A few times, his perception of reality became so warped
  he began to think he was back in Hell or Heaven.

    A medium-height, medium-build man in his early
  20's. Long blond hair (think 80's rocker), and black clothing. He
  has a deep, quiet voice, and almost never yells.

     Role-Playing Hints:
    </b>
    Protect the innocent mortals all
  around you from harm and corruption. Any demon-spawn you meet
  will feel the full fury of your might. So what if bystanders are
  killed? They are better off dying by your hands then being
  corrupted by the devils and dragged screaming to hell. Gaze
  around implacably at everyone you meet. When you get angry, St.
  Elmo's fire starts to glow around your eyes and hands.
