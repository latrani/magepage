Yes indeedy.  There are also the:

"Bite Down Hard" XP: For the player who winces at something he/she knows 
OOCly is about to happen to their character, but acts in-character and 
takes the bait anyway.

"Hunter Thompson" XP: For the player, who, when through an oversight of 
mine, has nothing to do for a while, comes up with a great idea for 
having his/her character create more plot on their own.

"H. R. 'Bob' Haldemann" XP: For the player who figures out a way to cover 
up a contradiction or an inconsistency in a GM's plot.

"Redemption" XP: For when the GM has promised "oh yeah I'll write that up 
for you before next time" and feels guilty because he hasn't.
