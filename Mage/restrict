Restriction Monitors:
        Thse Digital Monitors are a type og guradian spirit which are
incorperated into many of the technocrocy's secure systems.  Their
purpose is not perimiter defense, but the defense of the data the
systems contain.
        Any time guarded information is accessed, the transaction is
monitored.  If an unusual or unauthorized use of the data occurs, the
monitors acts to apprehend the culprit.  Becuase these precise-minded
spirits can be an annoyance to any operator besides the equally precise
Iteration X mages, they are only used to defend data that is either
very importany or seldom accessed.
        Restriction Monitors appear as faceles humanoid technocratic icons.
Their icons carry unusual pistols which shoot metallic rays.  If sensed
with the spirit sphere, they appear as man sized metal spiders.

 MAGICK:
- Monitor Data Flo ( *** Correspondence, * Forces, *** Mind ):  This allows
the Restriction Monitor to watch over it's assigned data in technomancer
computer systems.  Any use of the data bringsit's attention.  Unusual
manipulations begin investigation, unauthorized ones bering attacks.
- Relocate Data ( **** Correspondence, * Mind ):  When data is accessed,
the Restriction Maintains an unadulterated copy in it's files, as well as
a running log of alterations made.  This allows these files to instantly be
sent to a"vault" computer, one that is not otherise connected to the
web or technocracy machinery.  Such files can then be consulted by
skilled mages.  This prevents mosy VA program-traps and isolates computer
viruses for study.
- Data Scan ( * Forces, *** Mind ):  An apprehended Cybernaut is scanned with
this rote to determine what information he has taken and where this information
is located.
- Data Whipe ( **** Correspondence, ** Forces, **** Mind, *** Spirit ):  Armed
with a victim's knowledge of where information has been moved to, this
effect allows the Monitor to immediately attempt to delete it from computer
files and make persons forget it.  The second application is vulgar and
incurs parados.
- Icon Supression ( **** Correspondence, ** Forces, **** Spirit ):  This
is a technomancer version of the classic spirit charm Calcify.  With it, the
Restriction Monitor attempts to anchor an icon firmly to it's present location
in the Digital Web.  A Willpower roll is made against the target's own
Willpower.  Each success decreases the victim;s effective physical attributes
( or Willpower in the case of spirits ) by one and establishes 1 die of
countermagick against Correspondence ot Spirit attempts to move.  When the
sucesses decrease the abilities to ero and countermagick dice exceed the
mage's Arete the victim can no longer move.
- Icon Ejection:  Restriction Monitors can activate the icon-dump paramater
of technocracy controlled areas of the Digital Web.  They roll their Arete
against difficulty 6 against the victim's willpower to send icons offline.
