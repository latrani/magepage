   The Thorns of Life (Life 4 Prime 3)
  </h1>

  <p>
   This rote is one of the most bizarre rotes left behind by
  Brigid Helvronsdaughter, the infamous Verbena of Sylt. Apparently
  she sought a way to defend the coven in case of attack, and
  created the Thorns.
  </p>
  <p>
   She watered thorny bushes with her blood, and collected their
  seeds on a Thursday night in a small box covered with runes. The
  seeds are intended to be swallowed by the user (who doesn't have
  to be a mage or even human). Inside the stomach they quickly
  start to grow, sending out thorny tendrils through the body,
  reaching into the heart, muscles and brain and piercing the skin
  with black thorns. Needless to say the agony is beyond words.
  </p>
  <p>
   But the thorns serve a purpose: not only do they make the user
  fearsome to behold and dangerous to touch, they give him
  increased strength and regeneration. Wounds are closed as thorns
  sew them together, muscles are strengthened by resilent wood.
  Some users can even attack their enemies with their thorns. A
  group of thorn warriors is a horrible threat for almost any
  enemy.
  </p>
  <p>
   As the effect wears down, the thorns start to die and the body
  is magickally healed. Unfortunately the healing is slow, as most
  of the resources of the body have been depleted and the wooden
  parts only dissolve slowly. This is not a rote to use
  lightly.
  </p>
  <p>
   It has happened that the user has been killed despite the
  thorns and their healing powers. In this case the thorns continue
  the fight for a while (with only their own strength), and then
  the body collapses. The plant takes root, and in time only a
  thick, threatening bush will mark the place.
  </p>
  <p>
   [As the rote is activated, the user is immobilized with pain
  for a few turns as the thorns grow through him.
  </p>
  <p>
   After that, he gains a number of points equal to the number of
  successes in starting the rote to distribute between increased
  physical attributes, healing non-aggravated damage or making
  attacks with the thorns (this costs 3 points). For example, if
  the rote had four successes, then Strength, Stamina or Dexterity
  could be increased by four dots, a thorn attack and a one point
  increase could be done, or four levels of wounds be healed. These
  points can be redistributed by succeeding in a willpower
  difficulty 6 test at the start of the turn (if this fails, the
  thorns continue their work).
  </p>
  <p>
   A thorn attack means that the thorns rip through the skin of
  the user as he strikes his opponent, trying to burrow into the
  flesh. They add the number of successes from the rote to the
  attack; if it is a grapple attack it can be continued, which
  means that while the person holds the opponent the thorns make
  independent attacks by slowly strangling, burrowing and piercing
  the opponent.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, the thorns do one extra dice of damage to all
  brawl attacks even without a thorn attack, and anybody striking
  the user unprotected has to soak one dice of thorn damage.
  </p>
  <p>
   Quite naturally, appearance is devastated by the thorns and
  most social skills except intimidation get penalties
  (intimidation instead becomes much simpler).]
