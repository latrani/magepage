How to launder money: a primer.
 At times it is good to know stuff about how to get around the law 
whether you are a member of the Syndicate or not. At times it  will be 
good to know how to disrupt their operations. At times it will be good 
to know how to beat them at their own game.Mages have methods for 
gathering operating capital that defy common economic theory but even 
they must look out for the N.W.O. and the I.R.S.( don't believe me? The 
real life Al Cappone, Lucky Luciano, and Meyer Lansky were never caught 
for extortion or racketeering. They were busted for tax evasion. So here 
are a few methods for getting around those pesky tax laws. 

Method 1
Typical drug dealer method
1) get a million dollars ( how you do this is you own business.)
2) fly to the Grand Cayman islands and take your million with you.
3) Some banks in that area sell legitimate off-the-shelf 
corporations.(these are shell corporations or holding companies. some 
even come complete with a board of directors. Buy one of these 
corporations from the bank.
4) Open an account in one of those banks under the corporations name and 
deposit the remainder of your money.
5) enjoy the islands,get some sun and then go home.
6) When you arrive at home, "Borrow" a 100,000 from the corporation in 
the islands by wire transfer.( as sneaky as this sounds, this is totally 
legal.)
7) open a restaurant with a bar.
8) At the end of each month, take proceeds from whatever criminal thing 
you've got going on the side and deposit it in the bank as the take from 
the bar. It is a good idea to to over report how well you restaurant/bar 
is doing but not to get to greedy. The Internal revenue service takes a 
dim view of a pizza parlor that purports to do several hundred thousand 
dollars a month in revenue. If you don't get greedy you won't get 
investigated.they just don't have the manpower. It is also a good idea 
to plow some of the proceeds into the legitimate corporation too. If the 
company does well on it's own it can expand and offer more laundering 
potential.
9) Your criminal money is now clean as a whistle. Pay taxes on it.

Method 2)
the loanback method:
1) a new jersey gambler has half a million dollars in profits salted 
away in a numbered swiss bank account. He buys a string of car washes
(another great way to over report potential sales) for 1 million 
financing it with 50,000 grand down and 450,000 with a legitimate first 
mortgage. 
2) He "borrows" the other half million from his swiss bank.
3) since he is borrowing his own money and repaying it as if it too is a 
legitimate loan that means he has interest charges. This charade allows 
him to pay himself the interest and deduct that same interest from his 
taxes. thus bringing the money back into the country.
4) once he has paid of his loan to himself he may relend it to himself.

Method 3)
The Money Broker shuffle
Problem:
Mr A is columbian drug lord. He has a million dollars sitting in new 
york badly in need of deodorization.
Mr B is a legitimate columbian businessman who wants to buy a million 
dollars worth of U.S. computers but his government wants 21 cents for 
every dollar he buys with his pesos.

Solution: they hire a money broker who for a nominal fee will solve the 
problem.
1) the million dollars is smurfed or smuggled overland to an account in 
a mexican bank.
("smurfing" is process of wire transfer of money in tiny chunks less 
than 10,000 dollars. this is effort intensive but necessary. Billions of 
dollars are wire tranfered everyday but only transactions larger than 10 
grand are documented by banking institutions.  transactions smaller than 
this are fully covered under banking insurance thus larger transactions 
are carefully tracked in case something goes wrong.Law enforment also 
does not possess the man power to check all these transactions and never 
will. this is an every damn minute,24 hour a day phenomenon.)
2) The broker writes a check for U.S. 1 million at a correspondent bank 
in new york city and gives it to XYZ computers.
3) XYZ computers ships Mr B. his machines from its panamanian free zone 
warehouse
4) Mr B gives the money broker a million dollars worth of pesos.
5) Pesos become sqeaky clean pocket change of Mr A. Annual loss of 
revenue to Columbian government 6-8 billion dollars.

Method 4)
The Omnibus account method:
swiss banks(and others I'm sure.) maintain what is known as "omnibus 
accounts" at american brokerage houses. This make it easy for mafiosi to 
purchase american blue chip stock anonymously. Naturally, if they make a 
profit they pay no capital gains taxes on it because there are no 
records in the U.S. tying them to the stock purchases
and the swiss banks are bound by their laws not to reveal the names of 
their investors. this enables them not only to make money but to 
manipulate the market by buying large blocks of stock through the banks 
and then exercising their proxies, enabling them to determine who will 
be on the board of directors and who will be C.E.O.
