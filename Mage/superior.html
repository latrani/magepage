   Gentlemen. Recently it has been my priveledge to go on a
    cross-country trip. And in doing so I have had an opportunity
    to meet with, and inspect a number of our Laboratoies. Some of
    the Modifications that our inventive young minds have created
    for the use with our standard Superior templates were to my
    mind astonishing. I have taken the liberty of compiling a list
    of these for our common use and I hope that they will expedite
    the ascencion war and your own research. Acreditation of the
    Doctors involved, and genetic blueprints are in the appended
    file.

  <h2>
   1) Increased Countermagick:
  </h2>
  As most of you who have
  worked in Damage Control know.The standard Superior has
  CounterMagickal Symbols drawn on the protein of the D.N.A. this
  is what gives them their magical resiliency. Of course this makes
  them resistant to further tinkering. Many of these permutations
  unfortunately require the Erasure of these symbols. However, A
  lab in tuscon,Az. has discovered a way to increase the magickal
  protection for these clones for long term spying. often a number
  of these clones can used to create a magick-proof lynch mob or
  strike team. Would that we had access to these lovely creations
  during the Burning times. The process involves ritual
  Scarification of the internal organs and scripting
  countermagickal symbols on the interior of the flesh and the
  exterior of the bones. It has been further theorized that a
  comprehensive Tattoing process could yield further Countermagick
  but this theory is unfortunately impractical and has yet to be
  tested.
  <p>
   [ I.C. clones possess 4 dice of countermagick instead of 2.
  Most other forms of enhancement will not work in conjunction with
  this one. However, Progenitors normally use I.C.clones with other
  forms of altered clones.]
  </p>
  <h2>
   2) Regeneration
  </h2>
  One of our labs in Montana has had recent
  difficulties with local Werewolves. These trials did yield some
  viable samples of genetic material. The program director has
  managed to crack the regenerative Gene with some success.
  <p>
   [ Regen Clones are capable of regenerating 1 non-aggravated
  wound level per turn. Regen clones are often fitted with other
  forms of enhancement and can occassionaly kill garou if they
  attack in swarms. Aggravated damage,asphyxiation,Decapitation and
  total systemic shock are the only ways to destroy these clones.
  Unaccountably, Regen Clones often possess bad tempers and they
  have inherited a vulnerability to silver.They suffer aggravated
  wounds against these weapons. Regen Clones cannot have counter
  magic, but do not take Unbelief damage.]
  </p>
  <h2>
   3) Increased adrenaline
  </h2>
  Often used on strike team and
  sentinel style clones, This form is often mated to a number of
  other Enhancements.
  <p>
   [ these clones possess 5 "charges" of super-charged A.C.T.H.
  Each turn that they wish to use this they must make a stamina
  roll. one success is sufficient,but the diff goes from 4 to 9 as
  each use increases the diff by one. The effect is similar giving
  the clone Celerity 2, Potence 3,and Fortitude 2 for that turn
  only. Clones of this sort are often irritable and easily
  provoked. After combat, these clones will be ravenous and sleepy
  and will be unable to initiate many actions involving heavy
  physical action. they also are unable to spend willpower. Clones
  of this sort do not have countermagick and may take unbelief
  damage if witnessed in action.]
  </p>
  <h2>
   4) Reduced Pain Receptor
  </h2>
  An idea taken from one of our
  Iterator Colleagues. This kind of enhancement is often used in
  conjunction with most types of combat Clones. This Type of
  enhancement removes pain receptors from the clones body. The
  clone can feel no pain and is thus hard to slow down in a combat
  situation. the downside of this is that often the clone will take
  damage and simply not be aware of it. There is an anecdote about
  a clone that had set itself on fire and did not become aware of
  what was going on until it's vision became obscured. In the
  process of walking around, the flaming clone destroyed most of a
  laboratory.
  <p>
   [ these clones do not take penalties from wound levels at all.
  penalties might be otherwise imposed though.(such as a clone
  attempting to sprint on a broken leg.) These clones may have
  countermagick as the Attenuation of pain receptors is a simple
  Neurosurgical process. In addition they do not take Unbelief
  Damage.]
  </p>
  <h2>
   5) Abrasive Skin
  </h2>
  often used only on Horizon realm clones.
  this was achieved by splicing in Shark D.N.A. Less than pleasant
  to look at, but they do get the job done. The Void Engineers have
  found a multitude of uses for these Clones in their Aquatic
  theater Operations. Coupled with gills, and a few of the other
  enhancements, these make excellent underwater shock-troops.
  <p>
   [ The flesh of the clone has a number of rough hook-like
  projection. Touching the flesh can do a health level of damage
  and in Hand to hand combat add +3 to brawl damage. Cm cannot be
  taken, and the clone will take unbelief damage if observed. Note
  that damage taken from these does count as aggravated.]
  </p>
  <h2>
   6) Chromatophores
  </h2>
  Of only limited use as the clone must
  be nude to be effective. This is a common enhancement for other
  non-humanoid creatures. A south carolina Amalgam has created
  Aquatic clones with this enhancement with a great degree of
  success for use against offshore targets.
  <p>
   [ the clone has dermal cells which adapt to their
  surroundings. Cm cannot be taken, the clone does not take
  unbelief damage. when in use add 3 dice to stealth pool.
  </p>
  <h2>
   7) Sub-dermal armor
  </h2>
  Used often for heavy attack troop.
  Not recommended for use with clones that are a substitute for
  people unless that person is an extreme Endomorph. Confers an
  amount of damage reduction via the introduction of Bio-silicates
  in pockets under the flesh and in the hollows of the body. Clones
  of this sort will sink in water.
  <p>
   [ this enhancement protects the clone as if he were wearing
  class four armor, Subtract 2 from dex the clone does not take
  unbelief damage and cannot have Cm.
  </p>
  <h2>
   8) Natural weaponry
  </h2>
  This covers a bewildering array of
  physical attack mechanisms that have been bred into strike
  clones, the most common variety being retractable fangs and
  claws. with a bit of de-melanization and some metabolic
  tinkering, we can make ersatz vampires and with other forms of
  enhancement, Ersatz Werewolves. Allthough, natural weaponry
  doesn't stop there. I have been informed of doctors who have
  created clones with prehensile tails,Patagia and even one doctor
  who is attempting to give a clone Quills.
  <p>
   [ Some of the clones with the wilder forms of enhancement will
  take unbelief damage,whereas others with subtler manifestations
  will not. Ersatz Garou and kindred are usually spotable by those
  races allthough they could pass to the uninitiated or to others
  outside that race. Ersatz Garou have been known to trigger the
  Delirium but this is a lesser version and has a +3 on the scale.
  Clones attacking with natural weaponry do count as supernatural
  beasts for the purposes of Aggravated damage.]
  </p>
  <h2>
   9) Emitters
  </h2>
  Doctor Nedra Sellars came up with a clone
  that had been engineered with it's own set of super-concentrated
  Musk sacs. From what I understand, this modification has been
  used against Garou and Tradition mages alike with great success.
  The effective range is 40 feet.
  <p>
   [ no Cm,No unbelief damage until exposed. effects identical
  with Vomit gas.
  </p>
  <h2>
   10) Gills
  </h2>
  A natural for underwater operators,often
  combined with Increased visual spectrum, and pressure hardening
  for a more complete package. also good to combine with abrasive
  skin and/or Chromatophores.
  <p>
   [ The gills are often hidden in the hair,the pelvis,and the
  armpits, No Cm. No unbelief damage.]
  </p>
  <h2>
   11) Poison Sacs
  </h2>
  I have seen Clones that could sweat
  virulent contacts Hemo and Neurotoxins. there are also
  modifications that enable a clone to spit contact poison up to 30
  feet and there are clones who can make their blood extremely
  poisonous to kindred. There is a research project jointly held
  between us and Iteration X to create clones that can broadcast
  non-organic compounds.
  <p>
   [ spitters cause 3 dice of aggravated damage and possibly
  blindness, they have 4 charges before they must rest to
  replenish. Sweaters andÓchalicesÓ natural replenish
  their toxins. Chalices cause 2 levels of aggravated damage to
  their drainer for each Bp drained but there is an onset time of
  several hours. Often they are in their coffin by that time and
  may never rise again.(torpor) Sweaters Cause tear gas syptoms in
  those who come in contact with them in addition to normal damage
  Unbelief damage is entirely dependent on exposure. Spitters
  sustain it most often, while sweaters rarely do and Chalices
  never do. No Cm.]
  </p>
  <h2>
   12) Carrier agent
  </h2>
  you must recieve prior approval of your
  project director before implementing one of these clones. If you
  are not very carefull, you could cause a widespread epidemic.
  this is basicaly a clone that carries powerful versions of many
  types of Virus that it is immune to. the clone retains control of
  it's own release vectors,( but unfortunately once the virus is
  passed on,the cat is out of the bag.) often these clones are
  equipped with many different types of Virus. Seducers are often
  equipped with a pheremone control package and A.I.D.S. While
  infiltrators are often equipped with anthrax,polio, or Chaos
  Agent.
  <p>
   [ this is one of the few types of clone that can possess
  countermagic,this is because the virus has a seperate life
  pattern and many are custom tailored to fit their host. Unbelief
  does not affect these clones as there is precedent in
  history(typhoid mary,an experimental subject who got loose.)
  Approval for the use of these clones is very rare and termination
  of that clone's life is personally overseen by Damage
  Control.]
