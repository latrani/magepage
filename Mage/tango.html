  <h1>
   Tango Macabre

   The Tango Macabre is probably one of the most dangerous pieces
  of music ever invented; the product of a morbid collaboration
  between an Quimbada hedge magician and a deranged cultist of
  ecstasy. Exactly when and where it was composed is uncertain, its
  origin seems to shift so much in time and location when
  researched that many scholars think it was deliberately hidden by
  someone or something.

  <p>
   According to the most common story, the cultist sought out the
  Brasilian hedge magician to get in touch with one of his lost
  lovers. The magician promised a meeting, but demanded that in
  exchange the cultist would compose a dance to unite the dead and
  living. Under the magicians tutelage, the ecstatic created the
  Tango Macabre inspired by some of the more unsavory aspects of
  Quimbada. Finally, the magician began to dance it with the
  decaying corpse of the dead lover as partner while the cultist
  played. The lifeless body stirred, and the dead and living began
  a sensous tango. Overcome with jealousy, the cultist shot the
  magician and began to dance with his beloved as the intruments
  continued to play by themselves. The cultist and his love danced
  away from this world, never to be seen again.

   Regardless of how true the story is, it correctly describes
  the use of the tango: by dancing with a corpse to the music, the
  dead can at least temporarily be returned to (un)life. As soon as
  the dance ends, the body will again become a corpse. And due to
  the unholy cooperation between a mage and a hedge magician, this
  dance can be performed even by mortals who know the music and
  correct steps.

   Originally the tango appear to have been spread among the
  darker mages of south america in handwritten copies, many of
  which were erroneous and nonfunctional. The local Celestial
  Chorus learned about it, and together with the Order of Hermes
  (and some say the Order of Leopold) they tracked them down and
  destroyed them as blasphemies. But hermetic mages have a hard
  time destroying anything written, and a few copies made their way
  to the libraries in Rio, Cordoba and Alexandria. Since then,
  other versions have appeared, possibly based on stolen material
  or carelessness on the part of the hermetics.

   What few owners of the tango have realized, is that it has
  other powers than raising the dead. If two living humans dance
  the tango, they can dance into the lands of the dead - their
  bodies suddenly fall down apparently dead, while their spirits
  continue their dance in the shadowlands. To return, they have to
  retrace their steps and dance back into their bodies, which
  return from their apparent lifelessness. It is not possible to
  return without a partner, although the partner does not have to
  be the same as one entered with...
