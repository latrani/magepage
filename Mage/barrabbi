slow, as I haven't seen it.  So I am sending it out again...

---------- Forwarded message ----------

	Someone, a little while ago raised the point of why would any 
"normal" mage, not a Widderslainte, be they Technomancer, Tradition, Orphan 
or Craft become barrabi?  How do you seduce someone to enter the Caul?  
Basically, how do you make becoming a Nephandi attractive to someone who 
does not have a poisoned Avatar to begin with?

	Here's an example:  (Please forgive the constantly shifting tenses)

	A Virtual Adept, Primordial Essence.  His creed was information 
wants to be free, and that all things were simply information 
quantified.  But the more he tries to free information, the more he 
realises the futility.  It is never "free", it is accessible, but it is 
static, it doesn't change upon being widely distributed.  It is not even 
free from subjectivity.
	He sees the same thing everywhere throughout Reality, so he 
delves into the more dynamic spirit, the Digital Web, were infromation is 
free, or so he is told, where anything is possible.  All he finds are the 
contrivances of others, which rapidly diminish the "free" undefined areas.
	Then he finds a Domain in the Web that is constantly renewing 
itself, never the same way, information becoming free, finding new 
permutations.  The Void Engineer barrabi who rules the area takes this 
young mage under his wing, telling him of the plans of the Lords of 
Oblivion to remove the hateful, constraining concepts of form, definition 
and subjectivity from the world, to return it to its natural, free 
state.  The freedom of Nothing.
	The Virtual Adept is very much attracted to this philosophy, and 
spreads it around among his contacts.  It attracts many Cultists of 
Ecstasy, who rail against censorship and enforced morality, Sons of 
Ether, looking for a theory to fill in their Tenth Sphere and Hermetics who 
seek the Forms behind all Reality.  It also attracts retribution by mages 
who recognise the true thinking behind these ideals.
	Rejected and hunted by his peers for his beliefs, the Adept turns 
to his only solace:  the Fallen, who sympathise and feel as he does.  
>From there, formally joining them in their quest to bring about the 
blessed state of Oblivion is inevitable.
