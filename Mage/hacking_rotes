        jsbrown@u.washington.edu (Order) requested rotes for use
in the digital web or with spesific spheres.  Here are a few.

Invisiblt Icon ( ** Forces )
        Common knowledge among Virtual Adepts, this rote was created early
in the web's existance as a modification of the Order of Hermes rote
Veil of Invisibility.  With this rote, the mage alters the pattern of the
energies of an icon so that it no longer has a visual existance.
        This can be used on Icons both in the Digital Web and the ones
Virtual Adepts project into the real one.
        System is as with Veil of Invisibility.

Create Virtual Duplicate (***Forces,*Matter,**Prime)
        This lets a mage make a virtual duplicate a physical item.  The
duplicate acts like the item, but is limited to the effects of forces
three.

Energetic Object Transformation (**Forces,****Matter)
        This Son of Ether magick transfers objects from relaity into
Virtual Reality and back.  Some sons use this to carry large items
from place to place on disk.

Default Form (** Mind, ** Forces)
        This rote forces an icon to reflect a character's self image
for it's duration.  A great deal can be learned by examining how someone
thinks they look, especially by those with Psychological skill.  It is interesting that many prople think they look like their mirror image, since that's
how they most often see themseles.
        Rumors persist that Life Hackers have a Mind 2 Life 4 rote that
forces Garou into a particular form and holds them there.

Snipertrace ( * Correspondance )
        This rote was recently pioneered by combat Virtual Adepts using
their HUD displays.  The rote lets thait computers track the path of
any projectile back to it's path ( even those too fast for the adept to
see )
        Time ** can be used to determine the paths of projectiles that
have already been shot. ( Was the Man in Black behind the grassy knoll or
in the building?)
        Using this rote with a video input is coincidental.
        Mind * can be used to make the rote track many lines of fire
at once.
[ Each success ceoms closer to pinpointing the source, at 3 or more
successes the sniper's location is known enough to be attacked, even
if he is invisible or concealed. ]
