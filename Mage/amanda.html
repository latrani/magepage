   Mother Amanda's Black Bottle
  </h1>

  <p>
   Among the Verbena, mother Amanda of Wiltshire has long been a
  legend. During her long and eventful life in the 18th century,
  she managed to both become one of the most powerful witches in
  the British isles and the mother of a huge family spread across
  the villages in the region, beside feats such as defeating the
  Three Knights of the Forest and finding the Ring of the Sidhe.
  But she is most famous for her bottled weather.
  </p>
  <p>
   She used to go up on top of Grey Man Hill near the small
  cottage she lived in, and gather the weather into her potions.
  She bottled sunshine, rain, mist, thunder, storms and summer heat
  into bottles made by her brother James and then stored them in
  her cabinet. Sometimes she would open up one of them to help the
  harvest or make unwanted visitors go away. And it is said that
  her liquid sunshine had the most wondrous properties.
  </p>
  <p>
   But not all weather is suitable for experiments or practical
  use. In October 1778 the Great Storm attacked Wiltshire. It was a
  hurricane filled with dark winds and hateful lightening,
  something that made the Faerie hide in their freeholds and the
  wraiths to wail in the shrieking winds. Mother Amanda went up on
  Grey Man Hill as the horizon darkened, carrying James last bottle
  - the year before he had died just as he blew the bottle, as if
  his heart had suddenly burst. The bottle was a blackened, round,
  ugly thing made of thick glass, and now Amanda attempted to force
  the Storm into it.
  </p>
  <p>
   The battle between the witch and the storm raged for hours;
  instead of devastating the countryside the winds and clouds
  gathered over the hill and lightening lit the dead ash tree on
  its top into a flaming torch. But eventually, the clever witch
  won. She forced the storm into the bottle, and plugged it and
  sealed it with black wax made by bees from the unseelie
  forest.
  </p>
  <p>
   The battle had drained even the formidable Amanda, and it took
  her several months to recover (some say she never became as
  powerful as before; there was something tired and haunted in her
  eyes the last years of her life). Despite her weakness, she
  ordered her eldest son Arthur to bury the black bottle in a
  secret place she told him about and never to tell anybody about
  it. "If anybody opens it, the Storm will get out again, thrice as
  ill and twice as bad" she told him.
  </p>
  <p>
   Long after Amanda had died the people of Wiltshire told
  stories about how she had saved the land and the mysterious black
  bottle. Arthur grew up to a strong man and a good father, but he
  never told anybody about where he had hidden the bottle. Except
  for his clever and curious wife, who wanted to learn the secret:
  One day she just talked about the bottle and Amanda, and had
  secretly made the servants and children do the same so that
  Arthur was constantly reminded of it. In the night, she overheard
  her husband mumble in his sleep the instructions old Amanda had
  given him, and she learned where it was hidden.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next day, she sneaked away to the place and dug up the
  bottle. In the clear sunlight strange reflections could be seen
  in the black and rough glass, as if there was something moving
  inside. She looked into the bottle, and nearly dropped it out of
  fear of what she saw. Frightened out of her wits she dropped it
  into its hole, filled it with earth and fled home, never to fool
  her husband again. And to this day the black bottle remains
  hidden somewhere in Wiltshire.
