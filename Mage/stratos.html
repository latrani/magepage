   <p>
    The Stratos Design Bureau is a group of Void Engineers,
  Iteration-X Biomechanics and ex-Son of Ether engineers who also
  happen to be test pilots for the experimental new Void Engines
  they create. Their designs push the envelope of static reality
  and are thus prone to paradox.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Bureau is run like a hybrid between a research lab and a
  paramilitary organization. Most SDB personnel wear blue uniforms
  with a thin grey vertical stripe down their left torso (pilots
  reverse this color scheme). All SDB members report to Dr. Anton
  Shepp, the kindly old Void Engineer who designed the SDB
  Flagship, Stratos Prime. Dr. Shepp is a brilliant designer who
  had a talent for administration. He now laments that he never has
  time to design new Void Engines, but loves to oversee the new
  engineers' creations. He has a beautiful daughter (of course;-)
  named Keiko who no one would suspect of being a NWO assassin.
   </p>
   <p>
    The SDB has a major facility in the Asteroid belt, called
  Stratos Point. The base is a sort of a space HQ, and can be used
  in case the SDB's Earth based facility is compromised. The SDB
  uses "the Point" as a center for Iteration-X's mining in the
  belt, as well as it's primary purpose of researching new Void
  Engine Designs.
   </p>
   <p>
    The SDB operates one primary vessel: Stratos Prime, which is a
  research and exploration vessel that delves into unexplored
  regions of the Deep Umbra in search of new resources of
  quintessence to exploit. It maintains a tenous gate with Stratos
  Point so it can serve as a platform for testing new designs.
   </p>
   <p>
    Several SDB designers (ex Sons of Ether mostly) are working
  well ahead of the timetable with Iteration-X to create Giant
  Mecha for use in space exploration. This project would be shut
  down violently if any high ranking technomancers discovered it.
  The designers know this and are preparing a contingency plan
  should this unfortunate situation occur.

     SDB- Gluon
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    The Gluon is a one-man minifighter about the size of a large
  motorcycle (with sidecar). It flies using advanced antigravity
  materials to render it massless and is powered by a quantum field
  linked to it's matter. The Gluon is needlelike and metallic, the
  quantum field shifts colors like the aurora borealis giving the
  Gluon a very distinctive look. The Gluon is armed with a quantum
  focus projector which intensifies the quantum field around
  objects, but leaves life patterns unharmed.
   </p>
   <p>
    The speed of this design is unparalleled, VE astrophysicists
  theorize that it can achieve faster than light velocities if the
  Quantum Prime drive is activated, unfortunately all tests
  involving the Quantum Prime drive have resulted in the loss of
  the drive, and massive amounts of paradox.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Gluon was designed and is flown by Nestor Williams, a Void
  Engineer who once considered joining Iteration-X, but decided
  that his love of flying was too great. Nestor is a fanatic Pilot,
  and will go to great lengths to get more cockpit time. He also
  has a cybernetic left arm, which replaced one he lost in a plane
  crash. The circumstances of this accident are not on record.

   <p>
    A delta-winged triangle shaped affair composed of neomatter, a
  new state of matter which can currently only exist in the Umbra.
  Neomatter is not composed of atoms, but exists in a quantum state
  that is best described as hardened gel. Being contiguous,
  neomatter can be corresponded with much less difficulty than
  conventional materials. This makes the Muon able to
    <br>
     jump across huge gulfs of space. During one test run, the Muon
  "went the distance" and made it into the Oort Belt and back.
     <br>
      <br>
       The Muon was designed and is flown by Asquith Smith, an ex-Son of
  Ether who joined the Void Engineers when his chantry expelled him
  for unauthorized use of facilities. Smith wears an odd partially
  animate translucent red suit made of neomatter. Smith is somewhat
  overweight.

     SDB- Void Dancer
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    Iteration X's creation of a highly manuverable swept winged
  craft to stress G-forces on Biomechanical elements surprised many
  Void Engineers with it's graceful beauty. The craft uses
  Antigravity power cells to allow almost any manuver, and can also
  shield any living beings contained within from excessive
  G-forces.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Void dancer is piloted by 1011-1011 a Hit MarkVI Nanotech
  assemblage programmed for higher piloting and space skills than
  most other NT-1 Hit Marks. 1011-1011 often takes the form of a
  female human.
