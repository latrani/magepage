   Progenitor Paradigm
  </h1>
  <h5>
   By Chihiro Yamada

  <hr>
   This is the Final version of the Progenitor Paradigm Page, at
  least as far as i am concerned, these things aren't sacresanct
  aferall, if you don't like my page, change it! Thank you for
  those who made comments and suggestions (Anders Sandberg, Paul
  Strack and someone else whose post I lost) I have made some
  alterations and additions to the Spheres. i have also added a bit
  on the end about the Progenitor Methodologies.
   <p>
    Those of you with the Sourcebook on the Progenitors might
  notice that although I have used the names (which I don't like
  incidentally, but that's my problem) I haven't quite defined the
  Methodologies in the same way. I should say at this point I was
  never overly impressed by that book (though it had good stuff in
  it) but I disagree with the tone of the thing.
   </p>
   <p>
    Firstly I tend to be of the opinion (with a fair number of
  others on the net - it was certainly not my "idea") that
  Technocracy "Magic" IS science just that the Technocracy has
  developed technology 50 years or so ahead of what they allow out.
  The tools and equipment they use are the focuses and talismans
  that Mages would use. I didn't feel the book emphasised that
  much.
   </p>
   <p>
    I also think that there was not enough emphasis on PRESENT
  technology i.e. the technology that The convention has allowed to
  become part of the Paradigm. There are a great many uses for the
  Science that exists today that are powerful enough, and that
  Vulgar Magickal effects are for the most part unnecessary. anyway
  if you disagree tell me, I'd be interested to know.

    <h2>
     The Paradigm
    </h2>
    <b>
     The Organism
    </b>
    : The Organism is the
  fundamental unit of Society and Reality as we understand it. The
  Organism works in a predictable and controllable manner. The
  Organism controls Reality, we control the Organism in order to
  create a Better Reality.
    <h2>
     Magick
    </h2>
    <b>
     Biology
    </b>
    . By striving to understand the
  Organism in a mechanistic manner we can develop methods to
  control it. Biology is most strongly linked to the Sphere of
  Life, but can be used to influence many other aspects of Reality
  also. It is not straightforward to assign a "sphere" to each
  Research Field but approximations are presented below. Note that
  we follow the General Technomancy Paradigm on all Science and
  respect the other Conventions superior knowledge in other
  Spheres, though our use of those spheres are often very different
  to those other Conventions.
    <h2>
     Spheres
    </h2>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <b>
       Correspondence: Microspcopy, Communications.
      </b>
      . This
    Sphere is not a fundamental part of the Progenitor Paradigm,
    but the Genegineers often use Correspondence to investigate
    Organisms at the microscopic and molecular level. (The electron
    microscope uses forces and correspondence). They also use the
    Technology and of other Conventions, in day to day
    communications. (Cellular phones, computer networks, private
    jets, surveillance vans etc.).
     </li>
     <li>
      <b>
       Entropy: Senescence (Cell Biology)
      </b>
      . The organism
    breaks down. By striving to understand the cellular mechanisms
    involved we can prevent or manipulate the senescence of the
    organism or individual cells within the Organism as we see
    fit.
     </li>
     <li>
      <b>
       Forces: Energy
      </b>
      . Not an area that Progenitors spend
    much time studying, some collaborative work can happen with
    Iteration X e.g. neural interfaces, neural networks, etc.
    Iteration X can also help with the manufacture of equipment
    used in Biological Research.
     </li>
     <li>
      <b>
       Life: Biomedical Sciences.(Genetics, Microbiology, Cell
    Biology, Physiology, Molecular Biology, Biochemistry,)
      </b>
      .
    These sciences form the backbone of the Conventions tools.
    Genetics can be used as a method of analysing life patterns, to
    identify the Organism, as well as a method of altering the
    organism, (through one of newer Rotes we have allowed to become
    part of the Paradigm, Gene Therapy), The manipulation of the
    microorganism has proved useful in many ways, from the
    production of drugs to the ability to pass on drug resistance
    to commercial plants. By analysing physiological processes that
    we have identified many ways to improve the performance of the
    organism, from drugs, diet, and lifestyle. Molecular Biology
    and Biochemistry are the tools we use to analyse these
    processes.
     </li>
     <li>
      <b>
       Matter: Chemistry
      </b>
      . The study of Inorganic and
    non-living Organic Chemistry These are useful as tools in a few
    aspects of Progenitor research, e.g. Artificial Organs, and in
    the design of Research Equipment but the ultimate aim of the
    convention is to manipulate the Organism itself rather than
    rely on crude mechanical devices.
     </li>
     <li>
      <b>
       Mind: Neurology and Psychology
      </b>
      . We strive to
    understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the Brain and
    thus find biochemical methods of manipulating it. Pharmacology
    is an ideal method of doing this.. Medicine and Health Matters
    have always been very powerful forces in society, by
    controlling Medical advances we are in a strong position to
    shape future minds to our ideals. The NWO has extensive
    knowledge of brainwashing and other techniques and the
    Pharmacopeists often collaborate and use their tools.
     </li>
     <li>
      <b>
       Prime: Metabolism, (Biochemistry)
      </b>
      . The Organism
    requires biological energy to live. We have isolated the
    biochemical unit of Energy, (ATP and other compounds) in order
    to use it to manipulate the organism. Many of our tools require
    the use of this energy to work. Understanding the flow of
    Energy also gives us greater insight into the Organism.
     </li>
     <li>
      <b>
       Time: Genetics (Eugenics, Molecular Archeobiology, DNA
    fingerprinting Developmental Genetics)
      </b>
      . Genes are
    biological Programs that create the Organism, every organism
    has copies of this program in every cell. By the mechanism of
    Inheritance we can pass our influence onto future generations
    by permanent changes to the Genome. We can also reconstruct
    organisms of the past, or past movements of living organisms by
    collecting and analysing their DNA, their genes. By altering
    the program itself we can alter the time course of the
    development of the organism from the single fertilised egg
    cell, to the complete organism.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
     Arete
    </h2>
    <b>
     Progress:
    </b>
    The use of Research and Knowledge
  to gain a fuller understanding and greater control of the
  Organism.
    <h2>
     Quintessence
    </h2>
    <b>
     Metabolic Energy
    </b>
    . The Organism uses
  energy to live, Energy passes up the food chain from Organism to
  organism, by understanding the energy flow within and between
  organisms can give us useful information about the Organism.
  Manipulating the Energy gives us greater control.
    <h2>
     Paradox
    </h2>
    <b>
     Insufficient Knowledge
    </b>
    . Sometimes
  insufficient knowledge of the organism leads to mistakes. These
  mistakes must be explained and removed quickly to maintain the
  image that Biology is an essential and desirable tool for
  Society's good.
    <h2>
     Awakening
    </h2>
    <b>
     Education
    </b>
    . Before an initiate can
  further the knowledge of the Convention she must have a thorough
  understanding of accumulated knowledge of her predecessors.
    <h2>
     Mage-specific Backgrounds
    </h2>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <b>
       Arcane: Low Profile
      </b>
      . The ability to study
    fundamental aspects of the Organism without causing undue
    adverse publicity. This allows the Progenitor to present the
    discoveries to Society when the Convention determines it to be
    the correct time.
     </li>
     <li>
      <b>
       Avatar: Insight
      </b>
      . The ability to analyse the evidence
    and invent credible and useful models of aspects of the
    Organism. It are these models that define the Paradigm and
    further the cause of the Convention.
     </li>
     <li>
      <b>
       Destiny: Success
      </b>
      . The ability to investigate and
    prove her models coupled with the ability to convince others of
    the validity of that model will allow the Progenitor to
    succeed.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
     The Methodologies
    </h2>
    There are three Progenitor
  Methodologies that have slightly different methods and mindset.
  All use the Life sphere as described as above but also use other
  spheres. They are also influenced and collaborate with other
  conventions in different ways.
    <h3>
     The FACADE Engineers.
    </h3>
    The oldest Methodology, the FACADE
  Engineers were once the researchers, but more recently have
  become responsible for the use of Progenitor Science on the
  Sleeper world. They are the Methodolgy most interested in Social
  Engineering and thus often have things in common with NWO.
    <h3>
     Genegineers.
    </h3>
    This Newest Methodology are responsible for
  most of the recent Biotechnological and Genetic breakthroughs.
  They are the most technical and esoteric of the Methodologies as
  they primarily conduct and control Scientific Research. They
  often require Cutting edge technical equipment to aid them and
  thus have links with Iteration X. They are most likely of the
  Methodologies to use Forces, Matter or Correspondence science in
  their equipment to investigate the organism more completely.
    <h3>
     Pharmacopeists.
    </h3>
    This Methodology are the most
  Industrially oriented of the three and thus have links with the
  Syndicate, They have both successfully used Pharmaceuticals and
  Medicine as a very useful product in the Market. They will be the
  Methodology who will be responsible for the marketing of the new
  Genetic Technologies that the Genegineers have developed and the
  FACADE Engineers have decided are ready to be released to the
  Sleepers - for example, Gene therapy and the Genetic Screening in
  the short term, Human Genetic Engineering in the longer term.
