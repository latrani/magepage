To the tune of "Brother Can You Spare A Dime"
---------------------------------------------
Once I built a railroad, made it run 
Using Forces and Time 
Once I built a railroad, now it's done 
Brother, can you paradigm? 

Ran on solar power, light from the sun 
Tapped Quintessence with Prime
Science in full flower, now it's done 
Brother, can you paradigm? 

Once in flying suits, gee we looked swell 
Full of that Yankee-Doodly-dum 
Half a million years in Technocracy Hell 
And I was the kid with the drum 

Say, don't you remember, my computer "Hal" 
It was "Hal" all the time 
Say don't you remember, your digital pal 
Brother, can you paradigm?
