I found this on Usenet some time ago, saved it, and promptly forgot about it.
It's deep, turgid, arcane, and probably part of a Virtual Adept's Book of
Shadows, referencing all sort of odd things from Gibson to Hesse.

I have no idea what any of it means. 

Next time your Mage players start whining about paradigms, throw this in
their faces and watch their eyes bug out. They'll probably keep *very*
quiet after that, lest you expect the same level of philosophy from them...

::Cyberspace As Glassbead Game::

Gibson captured the flash,  nearly a half century earlier,  Hesse
started design of the depths.

The "Magister Ludi" says little of the actual mechanics of the
game.  It does provide a sketch of a symbolic structure which can
link "semi-formal systems" (eg. musical notes,  alegebra, pidgen
(primitive) English sets ....).   Since his time,  we have
explored a board that can begin this task.  We call it "the
computer".

It allows masses of people to experiment with various "glass bead
relationships".

Hesses work has other elements of usefullness.  The bulk of the
bulk is devoted to analysis of bureaucratic knowlege structures
of an essentially monkish format in a mercantile society.  He
succeeds in capturing many elements in traditional systems and
their wearing on the individual pyche.

Hesses earlier work focuses more attention on the pyche.  As his
archetype "low tundra lobo" starts to interface with some
Gibsonian primal circuitry.

In looking at systems,  a common perceptual trend is to see an
imperfect "holistic vision" and then focus on detail which often
grabs all of our attention.

It sometimes helps to look at the wisdom of our ancestors.  In
the first false dawn of cyberspace (of which surrealism is an
example),  Hesse layed out a 3 level sketch.

3.  The "upper level" is a set of books which chronicle
environment against skull combined with journeys to the east. 
Water against stone in the Paz-ia (Octavio) icongraphy. 


2.  Far more sketchy.  The model of a society.  It takes detail
only in the glassbead monument.  Interesting enough his model of
intellect creates two academic schools.  One is Catholic,  the
other secular.  This provides to the debate on "The Magic
Mountain" (Manns not neumann).

1.  A few of the mechanics at the "architecturial level".  The
ability of a lectures on systems theory to employ improv tea
ceremonies.  The ability of aspiring players to tag new pieces
onto the original parts.  

There is one more system.  This is a "meta system".

0.  You,  the primal "neuron", the "free human" who can examine
the Hesseian structure and modify it while adding custom
extensions.  The following is one of many possible "negative"
(flip to new set) developments.  Note the reversal of "."

.1 One striking thing about the "German pair" (Hesse-mann) is its
"patriarchial" structure.  The "model" appears to stress males
(in different ways).  "Neo-Neutopian" thought would strive to
enact the "feminine side".  

.2 One can go into many possible levels from 0.1,    but a
Jungian approach would have some men give voice to "anima" while
some women give vent to "animo" and perhaps vice versa.  One can
strive to lay a "coed" onto the Anglo-German forms which act as
"primal paradigm-ia" of the Neu-America (el norte) university
system.  Internet is the place where we introduce and mantain
this "bureaucratic viri".

One sees the truth of the fundamental Gibsonian approach of
conflict with the medium.  Gibson is also correct in recognizing
that institutions control the "backbone(s)",  but he draws the
wrong conclusions.  Institutions have raw power,  but only
rudimentary technique.  Smaller users may benefit from some
techniques,  but the use of "wave surfers" is not to "crack" this
relatively feeble infrastructure,  but instead to "de-ice" the
"hidden structures of reality" and integrate them into the
"emerging global mind".  We are cracking our "selves" (or perhaps
our "perceptions of self"),  we "real cyberpunks"(TM) use this
space to glide into "ontology"  (psedo (necessary for finite
machines) reality).  

You may now map Jamesian (William) flows of consciousness.  This
has been a literary experiment.  Please continue it for the love
of neu neu topia.



NO CARRIER

::LOW LEVEL PROGRAMMERS DELIMITER::

This discussion (briefly extended to alt.surrealism) is part of a
"broad course" or "coarse broad" discussion centered in
alt.cyberspace for "systems analysis" and "alt.alien.visitors"
for pragmatic experimentation.

There is at least one link between this "alien paradigma" and the
Hesse-Mann model.  The conflict between "institutionalized
knowlege systems" is in Octavian terms that between religion and
philosophy.  On a larger map (with Paz partially drew),  Islam
seems to have chosen religion,  the European centered
cosmopolitianism seems to have leaned more towards philosophy. In
alt.alien.visitors these two archetypes (stone on water) are
represented by the Illuminati and Knights Templar.  The goal is
to draw prevalent conspiracy theory into a rough historical
context. 

::THE PLANNED IMPERIALISTA::

If we can build a "cadre" of "half historians",  then Knight
templar bead games can be used to enrich "alt.illuminati".

The notation is a slight extension of the original fifties

Finding the "2 strings" (d, bennett) marked by (( )) gives the
"text title" which appears after "Signed:" (which is a "title

::BEGIN CARRIER:: (

okay dear reader,  you are "on" 
          (signed: ac) begin <<pulsing>> )

::pulsing:: a referance to other texts in the "total cyberspace
introduction".  In a frequently used analogy, each human
individual is one or more "neurons".  A "post" is a "neuron
pulse",  a "thread" is a somewhat linked series of such events.  

A slightly different terminology is used.  For example a "button"
is often used to mean a "glass bead" in the lower level in the
house of hesse.  

Regular readers of alt.cyberspace might know what I mean if they
have carefully followed the "neu-coder ring"(TM) sketched in that
group.  

If there is demand, important pieces will be repeated in ac
discussion.

::ac:: alt.cyberspace, andrea chen, alternating currents (a book
of essays by the last living major associate of Breton (Octavio
Paz) and the only "classical surrealist" to win a Nobel Prize).
