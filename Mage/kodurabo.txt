Kodurabo: A system of Hedge Magick for Ninjas
By Reverend Kinesis

While the origins of Ninjustu and Ninpo are lost in antiquity, one
things is clear when one begins to read in the field of Martial arts
with an emphasis on Ninjutsu....Throw out everything you think you
know about those ancient arts because you've been lied to.
   Hollywood can't make a picture about history without tinkering with
it, can't get Batman right, hell can't even settle on who is going to
be Batman. They can't even tell the right fucking story in some
cases.(anybody see "First Knight"?)  So why should it be a surprise
that they couldn't get Ninjas right...
     Ninjutsu is hard to describe without getting all spiritual and
shamanic. because it's primarily a spiritual artform that has as it's
goal the protection of life. Ninja follow the code of Budo just as
well as samarai do. They are not bad...they are just drawn that way.
They do however believe in using every weapon or tool at their
disposal without a second thought.  And hedge magick definitely falls
into that category.
    It is the sheerest form of ethnocentristic arrogance to assume
that only europeans were capable of developping hedge magick
especially since many master of the various Ryu's may have been
Akashic Brothers or Asian dreamspeakers.
 Thus I present a form of Hedge magick ascribed to the skilled
practitioners of Ninpo.
Note, Most Gaijin characters won't have even the slightest inkling of
these abilities even if raised in the west. These secrets are guarded
jealously out of long tradition and the Koga ninja clan are particular
hardasses about this. Since many american ryus are run by frauds this
knowledge can be hard to come by.

Roll: Wits+stealth(or misdirection   Cost 1 wp

1) Sound from the Void
The user of magick may place a sound that he can make with his mouth
at any place within his line of sight. The sound may be as loud or as
soft as the caster want it to be up to the limits of his own voice.
This is almost allways used to distract or divert the attention of
targets.

2) Walk without Trace
Ninja are skilled in the art of countertracking but this ability
enables them to walk swiftly and soundlessly over a surface that
ordinarily would be a telltale.(i.e. Snow, mud, creaky floor, leaves,
etc)   Note, that ninja may use countertracking by adding the number
of their own tracking skill to the trackers Difficulty, but this is
time consuming and sometimes requires special tools. the above method
however requires willpower and lasts for a scene.

3) See without Seeing
While nearly every ninja learns to develop blindfighting techniques,
this ability enables a Ninja to "see" by using his ears and his skin
as a form of proximity sense. With this ability, ninja operating in
areas with any available light operate as if it were broad daylight
and may still roll a straight perception roll in absolute darkness or
while blinded. In this way Ninja can flee or kill in conditions that
would stymie someone with just blindfighting skills. This ability is a
surprise to almost every Lasombra who has encountered it.  This
ability last for a scene.

4) Clouds of the mind
Gives the Ninja a limited form of Arcane. When the point of willpower
is spent, the user may subtract his Kodurabo rating from the
difficulty of  any roll involving stealth for the rest of the scene.
This can even be used in plain sight as long as the ninja can create
some kind of distraction that will enable him to re-roll stealth.
Typically this is created with torinokos(little flash grenades)

5) Veil of sight
The goal of many Ninja, Veil of sight enables the user to become
completely invisible.Note that this is psionic invisibility and while
powder sprinkled on the floor or running in water will not betray you
to those who are directly observing you. the ninja can still
be spotted indirectly by Videocams,motion sensors and geophones.
