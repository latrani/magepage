Some quotes from my Mage chronicles:

(When a player gave the storyteller some Coke during a very 
dangerous game-session)
Dont give Reality Coca Cola, It kills us!

(When arguing about the similarity between technomancers and 
Order of Hermes)
Emma (OoH): Hermetics are not technomancers. Hermetics are better.

(When arguing with a technomancer)
Emma: You are truth until paradox!

Emma:  When you are doing vulgar magick anyway, why not make 
it more spectacular?

(Salvatore the Euthanatos gives his own car the Good Death)
Salvatore: 	This car has lost its posibilities and must be 
reincarnated.

(The Orphan Lizzy tries to explain that she is a nice person, 
not a cold Euthanatos as Salvatore)
Lizzy: I feel bad about all those I kill, both the good ones and the 
evil ones.

(Lizzy and Salvatore are arguing)
- You're a psychopath!
- What is that?
- Ehh... look it up.
(looks it up) -Yes... it fits quite well. 

(Salvatore wants to help)
Salvatore: 	Trust me. I'm a sociopathic knife-murderer. 

- Can I help you Doctor?
- Could you please hold this rattle a moment?

Please kill my mother, I'm your psychiatrist!

- What did the spirit look like?
- It looked like you
- Poor devil!

(Theological discussion between Salvatore and Lizzy)
Salvatore: God is not a turtle. God is a bus.

(After some very weird experiences.)
- Where have you been?
- Washing away imaginary blood in an imaginary fountain.

(After meeting the Angelic Hosts)
The Archangel stole my coat!

(After the Euthanatos a bit too nonchalantly eliminated their 
driver)
Emma: Not that we in Order of Hermes care much about humans, 
but that was unneccessary!

(Janos has maybe a bit too much faith in his friend)
Janos:  Tessin is a Son of Ether, he knows what he's doing.

(The Goetic mage is interrupted in drawing his circle and jumps into 
a corner to hide (all 119 kilos of him))
Dr Sallai:	Tessin, I'm practicing necromancy!
Tessin:	In the corner?

(The mage is interrupted again)
Dr Sallai:	Curses! Are one not allowed to practice necromancy in 
peace? 

(Discussing the leader of the chantry)
- He is lying sick and dying - is that a good qualification for a 
leader?

- How did you know?
- A little demon whispered it in my ear...

- He can rip my soul into shreds... so what?

(After realising that their target wasn't the intended victim)
- Who the *hell* have we fried?

(Discussing a Master of the chantry)
- He is cruel, but unfair.

(An upset hermetic)
- You just look at the whole, not at the parts!

- If you lie a bit every day in 600 years, it will become a quite big 
	lie.
- It will become a Tradition.

- He doesn't breathe, so we can be calm.

(The Virtual Adept is about to be questioned by the Masters)
- In just *this* case information probably doesn't want to be free...

- Everybody makes mistakes. Why should she be blamed because 
	she has made a lot of mistakes in sequence?

- Hermetic fascists!
- We are not fascists, they have just learned from us.

(The Virtual Adept is held prisoner by vampires)
- I regret I have only one life to lay down for my chantry!
- That can be arranged...

- I have smitten them with the pure flame of God!
- Why did it smell of brimstone then?
- Well, it was *almost* as pure as the Lamb of God, but I did use a 
	little bit of infernal power...

- I'll have to rob a bank to pay my rent!
- Get real! Make a pact with a demon!

- The technomancers are not hard guys. They are as wimpy as we 
	are.

(Desperate and frustrated mages in the forest)
- What should we do?
- Sacrifice eggs to some bloody god!

- You brought lunch to a commando raid?!

- Hooray, we got a drunken Son of Ether... wait, it sounds 
	catastrophic!

(The SoE tries to make the trolls friendly)
- I brought a few rocks. Lets party!

- You are going to give them a Nintendo?
- You can afford some presents for your grandchildren if you know 
	a few demons.

(Son of Ether technology)
- I can build you a computer if you look away.

(Chantry politics in a nutshell)
- Do you have the rules? Can we find any loophole?

(The Virtual Adept wants to understand Order of Hermes)
- Do you have the teachings of your tradition in a pocket edition?

-I'm crazy, not stupid!


Finally, the motto of my chronicles:

- Youre insane!
- I'm a mage.
