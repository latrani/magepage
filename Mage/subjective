Now inviting GnuBee to #VA31337.

<JOIN> GnuBee has joined #VA31337.

<DemenShun> Welcome to the channel, newbie.

<GnuBee> Thanks, good to be here. (It's GnuBee, btw)

<DemenShun> Is it?

<NICK> GnuBee is now known as Newbie

<NICK> Newbie is now known as SuchANewbie

<SuchANewbie> Hey!

<NICK> SuchANewbie is now known as GnuBee

<DemenShun> First lesson, never trifle with the elite, kid. Unless you know
+what you're doing, you're gonna get roasted.

<GnuBee> But..

<DemenShun> No buts. I owe X-Cel a favor, so I'll teach you, but step out of
+line and all bets are off. Got it?

<GnuBee> yes, sorry.
<ACTION> GnuBee looks properly chastened.

<DemenShun> OK, let's try it again from the top
<DemenShun> Welcome to the channel, newbie.

<GnuBee> Thanks, glad to be here.
<ACTION> GnuBee smiles hopefully...

<DemenShun> Much better. OK, that seems like a good place to begin...
<DemenShun> Where is "here"?

<GnuBee> In channel pound VA31337?

<DemenShun> heh, i love it so when newbies try to speak elite (or worse,
+31337-speek). It's "channel number VA31337", kid.

<GnuBee> 31337-speek?

<DemenShun> like this: 'r u m or f? I have s0me h07 31337 w4r3z 4 u...'
<DemenShun> those of us who spend lots of time here find this rather annoying.
<DemenShun> but i digress..."here" is #VA31337?

<GnuBee> um yeah

<DemenShun> But where is that?

<GnuBee> well it's...umm
<ACTION> GnuBee thinks...
<ACTION> GnuBee 's brain starts to smolder.
<GnuBee> Inside the computer network?

<DemenShun> where inside?

<GnuBee> um...hmmm

<DemenShun> Look, kid, I don't have all day. Let me make it easier (I hope)
<DemenShun> What is the direction from you to me?

<ACTION> GnuBee looks puzzled...
<GnuBee> Well, where are you?

<DemenShun> I'm right here kid

<GnuBee> No, I mean WHERE.

<DemenShun> HERE. In #VA31337.

<GnuBee> But...oh. hmm. ok, so you want me to figure out where you are?

<DemenShun> Um, no, not quite kid.
<DemenShun> Kibo, this one's gonna be harder than I expected.

<ACTION> GnuBee looks around for someone named Kibo.

<DemenShun> Don't tell me you don't know....oh just nevermind. Look, think
+about this for a few seconds while I move to another server.

<GnuBee> aha! the channel is located at the server!

<DemenShun> Um.
<DemenShun> No.
<DemenShun> Ok, I am on a certain server, and you are on a different server.
<DemenShun> If the channel was on a server, which server would it be?

<GnuBee> hmm....yours, because you made the channel

<DemenShun> well at least he isnt totally stupid. Actually no, think
+about it...
<DemenShun> If the channel existed on my server, how would YOU be here? If
+I left the channel, would it cease to exist, or would it move to your
+server, or what?

<GnuBee> Well, I'm connected to your server, soo...
<GnuBee> hmm, are you saying that the channel exists on BOTH servers?

<DemenShun> I am saying that, and more...
<DemenShun> What's the direction from you to me?

<ACTION> GnuBee smiles...
<GnuBee> The same as the direction to your server ;-)

<DemenShun> Don't be a wise-ass, kid. I'll wager that you can't tell me
+exactly WHICH direction that is, can you?

<GnuBee> sorry :(
<GnuBee> No, I can't, because you won't tell me where YOU are!

<DemenShun> THINK dammit! I'm not doing this for my own mental health you
+know. Can you truly say that I exist? I mean you are talking to me, but
+who am I? WHAT am I? Could I not be a program running on your computer
+that has fooled you into thinking you were talking to a person? Where
+would I be then?

<GnuBee> In...my computer?

<DemenShun> and what does that mean?

<GnuBee> Ah, so you are telling me that it doesn't MATTER where you are,
+because in the net there IS no place.

<DemenShun> I think he may be getting it...

<GnuBee> And since it doesn't matter where I am in the net, I can get to
+any OTHER "place" easily, since they all exist at the same spot, ie. in
+the wires and circuits and microwave beams of the network.

<DemenShun> welllll....I wouldn't go that far...but then static reality
+is a job for another person. Suffice to say, yes, space in the net is an
+illusion. The same applies for people on the telephone as well, if you
+see what I mean.

<GnuBee> DemenShun?

<DemenShun> yeah, kid?

<GnuBee> My head is hurting

<DemenShun> I expected as much.

<GnuBee> No, I mean REAL bad

<DemenShun> I know kid. It's normal at about this point. Now, to continue...

<GnuBee> WHAT??!!

<DemenShun> Chill out, kid, your head will be fine in the morning. but
+there's a little bit more ground to cover.

<ACTION> GnuBee isn't sure he can learn anymore

<DemenShun> It gets easier from here on in kid, trust me
<ACTION> DemenShun smiles charmingly

<ACTION> GnuBee fails to be impressed, being more concerned with his head
+preparing to explode.

<DemenShun> Quit whining kid, do you want to learn this or not?

<GnuBee> Ok, Ok *grumble, grumble*

<DemenShun> Now, since place is an illusion in the net, tell me where you
+are.

<GnuBee> In #VA31337

<DemenShun> No, I mean bodily.

<GnuBee> Oh, I'm in Illinois.

<DemenShun> No, I mean WHERE are you?

<GnuBee> Oh! I'm at home.

<DemenShun> Yes, but WHERE at home?

<GnuBee> In my room?
<GnuBee> OWWW! MY HEAD!

<DemenShun> WHERE IN YOUR ROOM?

<GnuBee> AT MY COMPUTER!

<DemenShun> WHERE IS THAT?

<GnuBee> WHAT??

<DemenShun> WHERE IS YOUR COMPUTER?

<GnuBee> ARRRR..MY..MY COMPUTER IS IN ILLINOIS..I MEAN ON MY DESK.

<DemenShun> WHERE ARE YOU?

<GnuBee> WHAT?
