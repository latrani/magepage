   NWO Background Report:

  <h3>
   Subject: The Installation Man
  </h3>
  One of the least understood
  threats to young reality criminals (especially so-called
  "orphans") is the Installation Man. In several recent cases in
  the NYC area, reality criminals under our observation have
  disappeared without explanation. Typically, they were residents
  of apartment buildings. When our operatives questioned building
  residents about the disappearances, no one recounted any unusual
  events.
  <p>
   Of course this is typical for NYC. In numerous cases,
  residents have failed to hear screams and shotgun blasts in
  neighboring apartments. Last summer, when our Metropolitan Slum
  Clearance Unit used powered armor suits to clear a Lower East
  Side squatter chantry, other homeless did not remember the
  incident even under special interrogation. This survival
  mechanism seems to be intrinsic to the New Urban Paradigm.
  </p>
  <p>
   We have, however, detected a correlate among the recent
  disappearances: In each case, residents recall an installation
  man having been in the building shortly before their fellow
  resident disappeared. Residents report that the Installation Man
  is a white male, 30-35 years old, with a trim beard, work
  clothes, and a tool belt. He identifies himself as Tom, Gerry,
  Troy, Dave, or Todd. The only residents who report that the
  Installation Man entered their apartment are those who lived in
  apartments directly adjacent to the ones rented by the
  disappeared reality criminals. These residents report that the
  Installation Man inspected either doors or windows, or a common
  wall with the adjoining apartment, frequently using a tape
  measure to get exact dimensions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The building superintendents in some cases recall giving a key
  to the Installation Man, so that he could enter the reality
  criminal's apartment to measure for doors or windows. In no cases
  do landlords' records indicate that such services were ordered,
  nor that payment was rendered to a contractor.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    HYPOTHESIS
   </b>
   : We conjecture that the Installation Man is
  an independent agent. His motives are unclear. It is very
  possible that he is a reality criminal himself. Perhaps his
  "installations" represent some kind of trap for unsuspecting
  novices. It is also possible that the Installation Man is simply
  a Master Builder. If his measurements and installations are
  sufficiently precise, he may unwittingly create spontaneous, if
  short-lived, Correspondence sutures between locales.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    RECOMMENDED COURSE OF ACTION
   </b>
   : The Installation Man
  should be targeted for recruitment. If he declines, termination
  is recommended.
