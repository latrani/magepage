   The Gnostics
  </h1>
  <h5>
   By Anders Sandberg
  </h5>
  <hr>
   The Gnostics are a very old group. Once they were a tradition in
  their own, but today they are almost extinct. Most of the
  remaining Gnostics are members of the Celestial Chorus and other
  traditions. Some Gnostics even argue that the Gnostics founded
  the Celestial Chorus. They have influenced several other
  traditions deeply during the last 2000 years.
   <p>
    The Gnostics have a long history as the enfant terrible of the
  Celestial Chorus. They have contributed to more schisms and
  strife than anybody else inside or outside the tradition. The
  Celestial Chorus have in fact spent much time and energy in
  eradicating this sub-tradition to the brink of extinction. At the
  same time the Gnostics have paradoxically helped create the
  modern teachings of the Chorus, and influenced the Order of
  Hermes and Cult of Ecstasy profoundly.
   </p>
   <h2>
    History
   </h2>
   The Gnostic cults were most active in the first
  and second centuries in various parts of the Roman empire, most
  notably Alexandria, the melting pot of peoples and cultures of
  the empire. Such notable mages as
   <a href="http://www.webcom.com/~gnosis/simon.magus.bio.html">
    Simon
  Magus
   </a>
   , the philosopher Valentinius and Apollonius of Tyana
  are said to have been Gnostics. The Gnostics borrowed ideas from
  almost every tradition or culture, creating a weird amalgam of
  early Christian, Greek and Egyptian philosophy and magick,
  combined with the ideas from the Hellenic mystery cults. They
  influenced (and was influenced by) the Cabalists, Order of
  Hermes, Cult of Ecstasy, Celestial Chorus , Euthanatos and many
  other groups.
   <p>
    The Gnostics were a loose collection of cults, with seemingly
  no connection. These cult ranged from orgiastic sex-cults which
  would have shocked even Cult of Ecstasy, to groups of ascetics
  more strict than even the strictest Akashic Brotherhood. They all
  concerned themselves with the mystical experience, Gnosis, as
  opposed to mere faith, Pistis. This led them to mock all
  organised religions, by writing parodies of their holy writings,
  infiltrating them and spreading misinformation and by breaking
  the taboos of the religions. The Gnostics were true anarchists of
  the spirit. They saw all other religions as encouraging
  enslavement to priesthoods and secular powers with their legal
  and moral strictures. Against these things they ranged their
  cosmological jokes, their anti-morality and their magick.
   </p>
   <p>
    As Christianity rose to power a great struggle began between
  the Gnostics and the Christian mages. They used every available
  mean against each other, both mundane and magickal. Slowly the
  Christians gained the upper hand, by using the secular powers of
  the East-Roman empire against the Gnostic sects, removing Gnostic
  parts of the scriptures and killing the Gnostics as heretics.
  Soon the Gnostic movement was almost crushed.
   </p>
   <p>
    Many Gnostics fled to Order of Hermes, Cult of Ecstasy and the
  Cabalists. Some repented and joined the Celestial Chorus. But
  many went underground, and continued to spread their teachings in
  secret sects. These sects spread to every part of the empire in
  spite of persecution by the authorities. Gnostic thoughts
  infiltrated other sects and groups. Gnostics are rumoured to have
  infiltrated the Templars.
   </p>
   <p>
    During the middle ages some of the Gnostics began to work more
  openly again. They thought that the days of persecution was at an
  end as they saw how the Celestial Chorus began directing its
  forces against the Order of Hermes instead. These Gnostics were
  behind the Cathars and the Albigensians. For a while they were
  left alone, and began to feel secure. But then the Church
  attacked with full force, and they fled or were destroyed. The
  same thing happened with the Templars and countless other groups.
  This was the last time the Gnostics tried to work openly, and the
  end of their infiltration.
   </p>
   <h2>
    The Gnostics Today
   </h2>
   Today there are very few true Gnostics
  left. The Gnostic tradition has been assimilated into mainly the
  Celestial Chorus and somewhat into the Order of Hermes,
  Euthanatos and Cult of Ecstasy. Most Gnostic mages outside these
  groups are solitary, working alone outside the Traditions with
  small groups of acolytes. Some Gnostics are rumoured to have fled
  into the Umbra or to secret strongholds in inaccessible
  locations. Lately, some Gnostics have begun adopting orphans into
  their tradition, with mixed success.
   <p>
    Still, the Gnostics have had a very real influence on magick
  today. They have subtly influenced the traditions they have been
  assimilated into. Even if many mages in the Chorus will not admit
  it, the Gnostics have influenced their thoughts very much. The
  Cabala is filled with Gnostic ideas and symbols. And the
  Cabalists have in turn influenced most of Order of Hermes,
  especially the Enochians who use a very Gnostic worldview.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are still small sects around the world influenced by
  Gnostics. Hermetic-Gnostic ideas are common among occult groups
  today around the world. Gnostics may have influenced the Islamic
  mystics and some sects in the middle east. Pure Gnostic groups
  are rare, and in Western Europe the sects have been almost
  completely crushed.
   </p>
   <p>
    In eastern Europe the Gnostic thoughts still flourish among
  some religious sects, as they have done for a long time. Most of
  these sects belong to the lunatic fringe, and have forgotten most
  of the Gnostic teachings. The Skoptsers castrated themselves to
  show their denial of the flesh, while other sects celebrated
  orgies. It is possible that Rasputin was a Gnostic, or influenced
  by them.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Gnostic Philosophy
   </h2>
   To the Gnostics, no conception of God
  or the ultimate or whatever was infinite enough. They considered
  that the supreme being was completely ineffable and beyond
  anything that could be said of it. They laughed at the
  anthropomorphic ideas of the Absolute other religions put
  forward, and endeavoured to say as little about it as possible,
  save that it was too immense to have ideas about. To them, it was
  like the Tao or the Void. They did, however, consider that there
  was a small fragment of this infinitude in man and every living
  being. Gnosis meant experiencing this primal spark within
  oneself. This may be the oldest idea about the Avatar in Western
  Civilisation.
   <p>
    Exactly how the Infinite fragmented itself and descended into
  existence with matter was the subject of unending debate among
  the Gnostics. They had many theories; Some were allegories of the
  process in sexual terms. Some were allegories for human
  psychology. Some were excuses to heap ridicule on other
  religions. Some were attempts to ridicule the idea of
  understanding the process with the mind at all. In constructing
  these theories, they produced a varied and colourful intermediate
  magickal world of various Aeons and Archons between this world
  and the Ultimate.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Ultimate gave rise to a number of Aeons, usually thirty.
  These Aeons are sometimes regarded as periods of time, sometimes
  as worlds surrounding the physical universe, sometimes as
  spiritual principles or principalities, and often as all three at
  the same time. The Aethers of the Enochians correspond with this
  idea, as does the Sephiroth of the Cabala. Each Aeon has its
  Archon, or ruler, created by internal tensions in the Aeons. In
  other systems, ultimate reality itself is the First Archon and
  from this a number of Archons, usually seven, the Hebdomad,
  evolved by a process called Ennoia. Ennoia means that each Archon
  creates another, lower Archon by projecting its thoughts into the
  lower planes consciously or unconsciously, creating an inferior
  image of itself ("And God created man in His image")
   </p>
   <p>
    Somehow from these cosmic principles the force responsible for
  this world arose. This is variously called the Demiurge,
  Ialdaboath the blind god, Sabaoth, Iao and many other names.
  Sometimes this principle is sevenfold and identified with the
  astrological planets. This force was often depicted as
  androgynous with an animal head. Ialdaboath was often identified
  with the horned god of the witches, known to the Templars as
  Baphomet and to the Christians as the Devil. It created the
  material world and the living beings, into which the Highest
  breathed the spark of life.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Gnostics sometimes contradictory attitudes to material
  life were a direct result of their Gnosis and their cosmological
  speculations. Having experienced the spark of infinite within,
  they realised that they could not be touched by anything, and
  that they were free to do anything at all. Some considered some
  forms of activities more likely to obscure the vital spark and
  other forms more likely to liberate it. Some were libertines,
  some ascetics. Often they chose to be the opposite of the
  prevailing customs. The material world was considered evil,
  corrupt and imperfect because of its impermanence. Only the vital
  spark was immortal and would reincarnate until it achieved union
  with the Infinite, either at the end of the universe or by
  liberating itself in the meantime.
   </p>
   <p>
    Many Gnostics believed that they had to understand the deepest
  depths of human behaviour in order to ascend. No act should be
  too vile to do for a true mage. It is possible that some of the
  crimes the inquisition accused heretics for, was in fact
  distorted descriptions of actual Gnostic practices. And since the
  Gnostics always thumbed their noses at authority, they tried to
  make the Church even more upset by actually doing some of things
  they were accused of.
   </p>
   <p>
    Many Gnostics believed in personal ascension, like the
  marauders (This have led mages to accuse the Gnostics of being
  crypto- marauders) The mage should devote himself completely into
  The Great Work, to free the Infinite inside him. The rest of
  humanity was unimportant or a hinder for this quest. Other
  Gnostics argued that the whole of mankind would ascend together,
  and the role of the mages was to prepare the way for this joyful
  event.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Philosophy
   </h2>
   You believe you know the Truth, just because I
  told it to you a moment ago. But that was a lie. And this is also
  a lie. Everything I tell you is a lie. Paradox is everywhere, and
  there is no way out. In the world of dust and mud, only
  contradictions are certain.
   <p>
    Now you are confused. That's good. The next step towards true
  gnosis is to understand that you are living inside a great
  illusion, which you call the universe. If you could open your
  eyes, you would see what the world *really* look like, not just
  some second rate imitation like this world. We are prisoners in a
  prison made of mirrors and smoke. If you could only for an
  instant see the Truth, the whole world would crumble into dust
  and you would ascend into Infinity. Or you would go comfortably
  insane.
   </p>
   <p>
    When you have understood that everything around you is a bad
  imitation of the higher planes created by a incompetent god, you
  will be able to enjoy it. To ascend, you have to descend. Descend
  into the nethermost depths of pleasure, pain and degeneration,
  and you will find the most sublime truths. Ascend into the
  highest aethers, and you will find rude jokes scrawled on the
  walls.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Organisation and Writings
   </h2>
   The Gnostics were never a
  organised religion, but functioned instead as a series of elitist
  cults lead by a teacher. Each teacher spread his gnosis by word
  of mouth, couching the message in a form suited to the local
  beliefs, adapting Gnostic practices to local need. They also
  wrote down much of their theories, partly to remind particular
  teachers what they had thaught, partly to sow confusion and
  dissent in the ranks of the organised religions. Several
  alternative parts of the Bible were written to put forward some
  of their speculations (Like the Gospel of Thomas). Some Gnostics
  joined other groups just to sabotage them from the inside, or try
  to convert them.
   <h2>
    Meetings
   </h2>
   The Gnostics don't have any mutual holy days,
  but sometimes agree to meet in small groups. These meetings can
  happen anytime anywhere, and tend to become informal discussions
  about philosophy, magick and religion. Some may last for weeks as
  the participants become involved in heated arguments. Today
  meetings are very rare, due to the lack of members.
   <h2>
    Initiation
   </h2>
   Gnostics often choose the most promising of
  their disciples to undergo a initiation rite, which varies
  depending on teacher, initiate and culture. Some teachers force
  their initiates to participate in orgies involving sex, drugs,
  rock-n-roll, violence and gluttony, trying to make the experience
  as shocking as possible. Other teachers let their initiates fast
  and torture themselves almost to death. And some teachers take
  their initiates on mind-blowing visionquests, showing them a part
  of the infinite, and then showing them how tiny that part really
  was compared to another part, and how tiny *that* part really is,
  and so on. The goal is to force the initiate to Awake by shocking
  his sleeper mind and body, a bit like waking someone up by
  hitting them or by pouring cold water over him. If the initiation
  succeeds the initiate will achieve true Gnosis, a moment of true
  Infinity and become Awakened.
   <h2>
    Chantry
   </h2>
   None known. There are rumours about secret
  chantries hidden in the Umbra, in underground cities in Tibet or
  old monasteries in the mountains of the Middle East, but these
  rumours seem unfounded.
   <h2>
    Acolytes
   </h2>
   Cultists, Seekers of Truth, Ascetics, Insane
  people, Libertines.
   <h2>
    Sphere
   </h2>
   Prime. Gnostics tend to study Spirit to understand
  the nature of the universe, Matter to understand the work of the
  Demiurge and Mind in order to influence people. The Gnostics have
  a tradition of excellency in Mind, which they use to gather
  followers, infiltrate other groups and to achieve gnosis. Matter
  is often regarded as a very unclean sphere, which many Gnostics
  avoid.
   <h2>
    Foci
   </h2>
   The Gnostics have never standardised their foci, and
  most mages have their own ideas. Some foci are quite common:
   <p>
    Gnosis is used for Spirit, Prime and Life. The mage must
  achieve an altered state of consciousness to use these spheres.
  Gnostics use extreme pleasure, pain, concentration, fasting,
  suffocation, fear, anger, sleeplessness, drugs, magick or other
  means to achieve this state. Most methods are quite drastic. The
  most important thing is that the mage can achieve gnosis, not the
  exact method.
   </p>
   <p>
    The other spheres are represented using small statues or
  symbols, depicting different gods, powers and spirits. These may
  be common in the culture of the Gnostic, or by a purely Gnostic
  symbol. Correspondence may be represented by a statue of Hermes,
  Time by an amulet with Ourobos (The snake that bites its own
  tail. A very old Gnostic symbol) , Forces by a statue of Abraxas
  (A god with lion-head, wings and a snake coiled around his body)
  and Matter by a statue of Ialdaboath the horned god. Clay is
  sometimes used for Matter instead of a statue. The mage forms the
  desired thing out of clay, like the Demiurge who created the
  world.

       <a name="rotes">
        Rotes
       </a>
      </h2>
      <h3>
       See the Infinite (Correspondence 3)
      </h3>
      This rote is used
      to achieve gnosis. It works just like Co-locality perception;
      the mage successively sees more and more of the whole
      universe. Instead of instantly seeing everything (which even
      the Gnostics acknowledge would be disastrous), they start
      with the things in the vicinity, slowly expanding their
      vision outwards. The mage sees more and more, and will
      hopefully begin to understand something of the idea of the
      infinite as they expand their vision. Many Gnostics meditate
      using this rote, trying to expand the vision just a little
      bit more. This practice is of course dangerous, and countless
      Gnostics have become insane or died after accidentally seeing
      too much. Some Gnostics defend themselves by combining this
      rote with Mind 3 and projecting the Infinity into the head of
      an attacker. [ Many Gnostics combine it with other spheres,
      depending on knowledge, to achieve a even more complete
      vision. ]
      <h3>
       The Voice (Mind 2)
      </h3>
      The mage give his voice a tone of
      authority and power, making it hard to resist orders or
      suggestions made. Whatever the mage says, it will be
      remembered. Many Gnostics use the Voice in teaching or to
      gather followers. [ Each success add one dice to social
      rolls. To resist an direct order from the mage the victim
      must succeed in a willpower roll with a target number equal
      to the mages willpower (suitably modified. A direct, simple
      order as "drop it!" will increase the target number, while a
      complex or dangerous order will decrease it) ]
      <h3>
       Visionquest (Mind 3 Spirit 2)
      </h3>
      (Also known as Vision
      Thing among the Hollow Ones). The mage puts himself into a
      state of gnosis by intoxication, fasting, pain or pleasure.
      As the mage sinks into a trance, he will begin to see visions
      of the world around him, the Umbra and his own mind. The
      world seems to become fluid in the perception of the mage,
      constantly changing and reforming. If the mage concentrates
      on a problem or a question the visions will begin to reflect
      this. Using a visionquest, a mage can understand the secret
      connections and symbols he normally wouldn't understand.
      Unfortunately the mage seldom remember anything about what he
      saw afterwards, and becomes very incoherent during the quest,
      which severely limit the use of the rote. Many Gnostics use
      their acolytes to write down what they see during their
      visions, and afterwards try to understand what they
      discovered. A mage undergoing a visionquest is in serious
      danger from his subconscious, which may erupt into his
      visions if it contains strong negative emotions, traumas or
      illnesses. Some spirits may also seize the opportunity to
      enter the mages consciousness as his defences are down. [
      During the vision the mages dream, intuition, enigmas,
      cosmology and occult are increased by the number of
      successes. On the other hand, willpower and all social and
      mental attributes are halved (round down). This should really
      be roleplayed. ]
