  <h1>
   A step into the Twilight Zone....Southern Style
  </h1>
  <i>

  <p>
   During an extremely bizarre game of Mage, I had one of the
  characters contacted by certain spiritual entities who were
  frightened by recent events and wanted to give the Characters
  some information. It was interesting enough that I thought
  Y’all get some use out of it.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Abode:
  </h2>
  A large blue green trailer ( a double wide at
  least with concrete reinforcement.) sets up the hill from
  middling sized yard. The driveway is took up with an old Chevy up
  on blocks waiting for the man of the house to get around to
  fixing it. As is typical, right around the area where this work
  is taking place there are patches of ground where the grass will
  never grow again. Strangely, the man of the house is never seen.
  The yard is littered with toys, a mangy yellow dog, and dog poop.
  Up closer to the trailer is an immaculately kept herb garden.
  There is a DSS dish on the roof and the property is bounded on
  three sides by ancient sycamore trees that reach high into the
  sky.
  <p>
   The Mailbox reads: "The Fates" in the same way that it might
  read "The Smiths" or "The Johnsons".
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Interior:
  </h2>
  The House is a dazzling display of fake
  wood paneling and formica and linoleum. No chairs in the house
  match and every piece of furniture shows the kind of wear that
  only children can put on it. the floor is littered with toys
  although one never sees a child. The only thing that makes the
  house livable is that there is much that is hand-made. There is a
  latch hook rug on the floor. Knitted pillows on the sofa and
  doilies on every flat wood surface. The kitchen is large and
  brightly lit and perfectly clean. The television is always on and
  tuned to some talk show or soap opera. There is a large comfy
  chair with a nearby walker and there is an end table on one side
  which has sewing notions,a stack of tabloids,like the Enquirer
  and the Globe (heavily annotated) and a KJV Bible.(also heavily
  annotated.)
  <h2>
   Carlene:
  </h2>
  The youngest and the most energetic, Carlene can
  be very mercurial. By turns she is sweet,loving, lusty,sullen,and
  just plain rattlesnake mean. Carlene has got a tattoo,and a
  pierced lip and long dishwater blonde hair. She’s
  voluptuous in a sort of White-Trash way and she comes off like
  any dumb southern girl on the Jerry Springer show might. She is
  almost always in some stage of pregnancy. She will flirt with any
  decent looking male who crosses her path.
  <p>
   Carlene will take to anybody with a sense of humor or somebody
  who is less than serious. and you should be warned that no matter
  how dumb Carlene might appear...she is not. Underestimating her
  is a sure way to earn her enmity.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Lucy-Mae:
  </h2>
  The Lady of the House. Lucy-Mae is kind of
  dowdy and is constantly working on some project around the place,
  much of the time, this involves cooking or canning preserves.
  Carlene is not allowed in the kitchen on pain of death and this
  often touches off arguments between them. Lucy’s hair is
  going grey and she hits the beauty parlor at least once a week.
  Her only bad habit is that she chain-smokes like a fiend while
  she goes about her tasks. Any character who ends up looking lost
  or at least not busy, will be put to work snapping green beans or
  peeling carrots.
  <p>
   Lucy-Mae will inevitably gravitate towards the person carrying
  around the most pain. The surest way to upset her is to clam up
  when she starts talking to you.Lucy-Mae has a lot of wisdom to
  share on many different topics but most inevitably lead back to
  relationships. Any body who thinks that they are going to be able
  to consult the Fates in this aspect without getting a home cooked
  dinner first is sorely mistaken and it is Lucy-Mae who insists
  that the Characters display patience and good manners first. If
  you’re told to set the table, By god you better do it.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Annabelle:
  </h2>
  The Old lady of the House. She sits in her
  chair, drinks her iced tea,thumbs through her tabloids and
  watches the T.V. with one eye. pets the stinky dog, Knits, and
  does little else. Annabelle is very old and grey and has that old
  people smell to her. she is constantly chuckling to herself as if
  over some private joke. She only has the inclination to talk to
  those who talk seriously and even then she’s awful
  elliptical. Annabelle never gets mad at people in the house
  because she is beyond all that. the only time that a character
  will see her wrath is if they have incurred the wrath of the
  other two women. it is at this point that Annabelle stands up
  ,without her walker, and will look the character in the eye and
  tell them to leave. The character will get the unmistakable idea
  that to push any further is to invite some ineffable cataclysm.
  <h2>
   Dinner:
  </h2>
  Green beans,mashed potatoes,three bean salad,
  fried chicken, salt water cornbread, Vegetarians will be looked
  at as if they are some kind of freaks. Dinner also features an
  inevitable argument between Carlene and Lucy-Mae.(The topic is
  not important.) The Argument is a test of sorts, Characters who
  stay out of it or who make it worse will have difficulties later
  on. Those who try to heal the breach between the two women will
  earn Fate’s good impression. The fight usually ends with
  Carlene screaming "YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND ME!" at Lucy-Mae and
  stalking off into her room, slamming the door behind her. The
  players have exactly one hour to try to talk Lucy-Mae down and to
  appeal to Carlene to come out of her room. If they do not do
  this, Carlene will emerge from her room dressed as if she’s
  going out to some bar and will slam out the front door not to be
  seen again.
  <h2>
   The Ritual:
  </h2>
  After Dinner, at some point, Annabelle will
  say, "Well...Let’s get down to brass tacks. You headed all
  this way for a purpose didn’t you?"
  <p>
   The Characters will be lead out to the backyard which is
  strewn with the inevitable toys and has a large inflatable wading
  pool in the center. They will be offered a choice; either to see
  what destiny would have them see. or to ask 3 questions and see
  what is shown in answer.
  </p>
  <p>
   Each fate must stir the wading pool with a sycamore stick. If
  Carlene is not present for whatever reason, the vision will be
  incomplete or the characters will only be able to ask 2
  questions.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you are exceptionally cruel,like myself, Have the dog jump
  into the wading pool at some inopportune moment only to get
  yelled at by everyone and then run off into the trees. The dog
  will be the ending of whatever visions there are to be had. If
  asked, Lucy-Mae will mutter about having to cleanse the pool for
  the full turn of a moon, Damnit.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Why:
  </h2>
  Occasionally, the fates choose to manifest in many
  different ways. This is but one aspect of them, why do they
  change from face to face? One could make a case that it reflects
  the basic changeable nature of Woman who the Fates are symbolic
  of. but the truth is...it is really only for their private
  amusement. Fate enjoys testing those who would know it’s
  secrets and this is but one of it’s ways.
