   The Temptress is a dangerous and subtle paradox spirit. It will
  appear as the most beautiful woman (or man) the mage can imagine.
  The Temptress will always know the secret desires of the mage,
  which it uses to seduce him. It will behave as the dream lover
  out of the mage's dreams, in the beginning. It will lure the mage
  into its grip, where it will slowly twist him and send him to his
  doom.
   <p>
    Unlike most paradox spirits, the Temptress seldom tries to
  destroy the mage using direct means. Instead it will charm him,
  fulfilling almost any dream possible and slowly bind the mage to
  itself. At first the demands are trivial, like jewelry and that
  the mage must tell it how much he loves her. Later they start to
  become heavier, as the Temptress wants her lover to stay with her
  (It is extremely jealous, and will use coincidental magick to
  break down any other relationship). Finally the mage is
  completely bound to it, doing its every whim.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now it will slowly begin to twist the mage, making it harder
  and harder for him to comply with her orders. Slowly the mage
  will do worse and worse things to please, turning his back to
  anybody but the Temptress. It will turn the mage against his
  friends, his society and his tradition. Often someone objects,
  and many victims of the Temptress have died by someone else's
  hand while the spirit laughed. If this does not work, it will
  begin to erode the personality of the mage, turning him into a
  spineless slave. Finally it betrays him, completely destroying
  any remaining humanity.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sometimes it fails in its mission. It may then shift to its
  other personality, the spurned lover. It will attack every friend
  and loved one of the mage, turning them away from him and thus
  making the victory of the mage taste like ashes.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Temptress has no fixed appearance, but tends to form
  itself out of the secret dreams of its victim. Sometimes it
  possesses someone in the mage's vicinity (his wife, lover or
  acolyte, for example) and uses them to seduce the mage. Usually
  it is very hard to detect that it really is a spirit and not a
  human.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is usually called when a mage suffers paradox backlash on
  Mind, especially emotion-controlling Mind magick. It can also be
  summoned quite easily, if anyone is stupid enough.

     Charm Attack (Mind 3):
    </b>
    The Temptress radiates an
  extreme charisma. Every affected person in the vicinity will
  behave as if they were totally in love with it. They will also
  become quite jealous, and try to destroy each other.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Sense Affection (Mind 2):
    </b>
    The Temptress can accurately
  see and understand the nature of the friendships and loves of the
  victim, thus easily manipulating the victim for maximum
  effect.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     True Love (Mind 1):
    </b>
    This effect will make the surface
  of the mind of The Temptress behave like in a normal human deeply
  in love with the victim. The Temptress will always seem to love
  the victim truly, if subjected to a mental scan of some kind.
  Unless the scan gains more successes than this effect, nothing
  strange will be noticed.
