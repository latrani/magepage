HOLLOW ONES

"Nothingness must be given from the heart of Being...."
        - Jean-Paul Sarte, from his Essays on Existentialism

For the Hollow Ones, discovery is the primal beginning of their theurgy.  As
the self-Awakened, Hollowers place magick before Tradition, and each new
style of casting, each new effect, is theurgy.

At heart, Hollowers are existentialists, even if they don't take the label.
They have seen the world through Awakened eyes, and they KNOW it sucks.
There is no meaning behind existence for a Hollow One, so there is no true
core beliefs to form a traditional theurgy around.  However, this
existential worldview ("The world sucks, and there is no reason why, it just
does.") makes the Hollowers very self-centered; Since there is no meaning
outside of them, they must find it within.  

To that end, magick becomes a grand quest of self-discovery.  Each new rote
they create, each new Sphere they venture into, and each questing they go
on, becomes a very personal theurgy.  As they strive to become one with the
meaningless around them, they define themselves and the world around them.

Theurgy is probably a bad word for what the Hollowers do; it implies a solid
worldview around which to base it.  Hollowers see no worldview beyond the
great Nothingness, so they strive less for theurgy, and more for self-discovery.
