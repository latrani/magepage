   Roleplaying Games of the World Of Darkness

  <p>
   There are more roleplaying games in the WoD than Black Dog
  Games (Lycanthrope: The Rapture, Warlock: The Pretension,
  Spectre: The Annihilation, Faeries: The Delusions, and Vampire:
  The Hidden) and Magicians on the Bay.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Sekt
  </h2>
  Sekt was inspired by a Nephandi working through
  mortal acolytes seeking to spread his dark vision among youths
  across the world. The game was intended to glorify occultism,
  cynicism, violence, destruction and gore, revealing hints of the
  real World of Darkness through a warped mirror so that sensitive
  players would become uncertain of what was real and what was
  game, eventually starting to live out their obsessions in real
  life.
  <p>
   But the Nephandi had not counted with the forces of Madness;
  he lost control of his acolytes as they slowly became more and
  more obsessed with the game and its setting, weaving a wild and
  tangled web of conspiracy, Gnostic mysticism and real magick.
  Instead of just glorifying darkness, the game subtly hinted that
  the great illusion of reality could be broken, and that Man could
  become God.
  </p>
  <p>
   The game is doing quite well, although far from the big league
  of Black Dog Games and TLA. And it has disturbing effects on
  players, who often start to notice odd things or think disturbing
  thoughts. Sometimes this turns into obsession as originally
  intended, but instead of just leading victims further into
  darkness, the game can actually Awaken them if they commit the
  gruesome rituals mentioned; they awaken as Marauders, trapped in
  a Quiet based on the game where reality is an illusion ruled by
  unseen forces and black conspiracies, and destruction of all
  normality is the only salvation.
  </p>
  <h2>
   TLA Games
  </h2>
  TLA is a huge games conglomerate partially
  influenced by the Technocracy. It is the largest manufacturer of
  roleplaying games in the world, although many criticise it for
  being conventional and not very creative - which is exactly why
  the Technocracy supports it.
  <p>
   Their best-selling game Towers &amp; Titans teaches players
  two important lessons (while draining their valets of money). The
  first lesson is that magic is all about creating fireballs,
  invisibility, enchanting weapons so that they do more damage,
  animating undead and turning people into frogs - assuming you
  have the right spells, enough mana and sufficiently high level
  (or the correct tome of spells). Magic is fictional, and highly
  restricted by lots of silly rules.
  </p>
  <p>
   The second important lesson is that rules control everything;
  nothing is possible unless there is a rule or table somewhere.
  But clever players soon learn that there is power in rules - by
  finding obscure rules they can gain immense power, and perhaps
  even wrest control from the Gamemaster.
  </p>
  <p>
   The hugely popular TLA games have a distinct effect on the
  mostly young players: they become involved in reading tables and
  rules, and most soon become adept at probability calculations.
  They also tend to become competitive, always looking for useful
  advantages in gaining more experience points - both in the game
  and socially among others.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Seraphim
  </h2>
  The Ascension War is already so bizarre that the
  Order of Hermes decided it wouldn't be that absurd to get into
  the roleplaying business too. They created the game Seraphim
  (distributed and translated in the US by Order Games), where
  players play manifestations of cosmic forces seeking inner and
  outer balance, pursued by various more or less menacing
  conspiracies. To reach balance, the characters have to discover
  and solve occult riddles according to the complex twists and
  turns in the Tree of Life and the alchemical work, thus learning
  the basics of the hermetic paradigm.
  <p>
   It is a bit too abstract and complicated for most players, who
  prefer the easy mayhem of Towers &amp; Titans or the tragically
  hip Black Dog games, but a few have become interested in the
  game's obscure hermetic symbolism and look forward to new
  supplements detailing the secret history of the world, the
  various conspiracies, the existence of lifestealing entities and
  an ultimate Grand Plan.
