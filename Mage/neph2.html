   <h2>
    Material Entities ("Gremlins")
   </h2>
   These beings lack own
  bodies, and when they manifest in a physical form, they animate
  dead matter. Using their powers, they can make otherwise rigid
  objects bend and move, and they can control machines. For
  example, a being can animate a marble statue, giving it the power
  to move and act. It is still hard marble, but the marble changes
  shape when it moves. A being possessing a car can make it move as
  it wish, override what the driver does, lock the doors and
  possibly make it crunch together. A being possessing a knife can
  make it jump through the air at a target, and burrow into its
  flesh.
   <p>
    An Entity doesn't see the world very well (except using the
  senses of the possessed object, if it has such). They see it from
  an Umbral level, noticing mostly life and magickal things but
  having great trouble distinguishing material things. They are
  attracted to strong negative feelings like fear, pain and death,
  and seek out sources of them directly. On the other hand, they
  feel Paradox as pain, so they try to avoid sources of
  paradox.
   </p>
   <p>
    Nephandi sometimes use these beings to attack their enemies,
  defend their labyrinths or just set them loose in the world to
  cause suffering. Often they appear in large schools, hunting
  together. They are not very bright, and don't understand much.
  They follow orders to the letter, often without any imagination
  at all. Subtlety is above them, and they prefer blunt, direct
  approaches. As soon as their victim begins to feel negative
  emotions (like fear when glass shards start to creep around),
  they will zoom in on the source, often causing even more negative
  emotions (like combined fear and pain when the shards pierce the
  flesh). This makes them even more active, and they will continue
  trying to cause more negativity as long as possible. When they
  cannot extract any more, they go dormant if there is no other
  sources in the vicinity. Dormant entities can remain so for a
  long time, but often succumb to the paradox they have garnered
  during the wait.

     Matter 3 Animate matter:
    </b>
    The being can animate a
  material object and make it change shape to move, or control its
  actions. Most beings can't use the more subtle functions (like
  reprogramming a computer), and prefer simple physical actions
  (like strangling a victim with the power cord).
   </p>
   <p>
    [The number of successes will equal the beings physical
  traits, modified by the nature of the animated object. For
  example, a statue will increase strength and stamina with 2, a
  car strength, dexterity and stamina with 4 and a pane of glass
  decrease the stamina with 2.]
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Mind 2:
    </b>
    The being can feel sources of negative emotions
  in the vicinity.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Mind 1:
    </b>
    The being will always understand the
  capabilities of any object it possesses. If it becomes a car, it
  will know all functions of the car (but no traffic rules).

   This being is one of the least known and understood beings
from the Deep Umbra. The few mages who have dealt with it have left
contradictory reports about it. It seems to have no difficulty
manifesting on Earth, despite its paradoxical manifestations. It
lacks any name except a strange symbol, which is its insignia. It
seems to be both mindless and coldly planning.
   <p>
    When the Nameless God manifests, it manifests as impenetrable
  darkness filled with the flutter of wings and far of cries of
  birds. When manifesting inside buildings, in darkness or confined
  spaces it doesn't have any shape, it fills the shadows and
  absorbs the light. When manifesting outside, in sunlight, it will
  manifest as a broad pillar of darkness, stretching into the sky.
  It doesn't have any limbs or pseudopodia, just darkness. It
  doesn't have any physical presence, and thrown objects pass right
  through it. Or disappear.
   </p>
   <p>
    The being has some worshippers, people who try to appease or
  serve it. Most of these were quite ordinary people who one day
  was approached by the being and were converted. They seem to be
  slightly deranged, but its hard to notice their strangeness. They
  seem also to have an intuitive knowledge of what their god want
  and what to do. According to its worshippers, the Nameless God
  (Or the Bird-Darkness) is the God of Endings. It rules over
  everything that ends, from the sudden death of a loved one to the
  end of a movie. It's Atropos, the power that cuts off the thread
  of life and existence.
   </p>
   <p>
    The worshippers build crude temples wherever they can find a
  good place, erect something to work as an altar and inscribe it
  with the symbol of their god. Many such temples are decorated
  with strange things that the worshipers feel fit, like discarded
  trash, random newspaper clips about endings, clothes from victims
  or paintings of the god. They end (i.e. sacrifice) things,
  plants, animals and humans for the god, which will appear, and
  when it disappears the sacrifices will have disappeared too. Some
  worshipers are more specialized, like one old man who acquired
  artworks from artists, and then make sure he is killed so the
  work is the last ever of the artist. It is then placed in his
  temple. Another group used a crude altar of crates in a warehouse
  to sacrifice food and magazines. The god accepted the sacrifices
  of both groups.
   </p>
   <p>
    One odd property of the god is that it dislikes circles. It
  cannot cross a circle, either drawn or implied (like drawn in the
  air with a finger). Maybe its because a circle has no end, and
  thus is resistant to the god. Badly drawn circles or just implied
  circles will not hold it for long, and soon it will leak over
  them.
   </p>
   <p>
    Another very strange thing about the nameless god is how it
  selects its high priests. The High Priest will not normally die,
  although he will age normally. The god protects the priest from
  serious accidents and physical dangers. But if somebody tries to
  kill the High Priest the god will not interfere, and choose the
  killer as a new Priest. Unlike the other worshipers, who
  voluntarily serve it, the new High Priest is very seldom inclined
  to serve it, and will most often try to escape. But this is
  impossible, since the god can appear everywhere. It will protect
  him from any large physical danger (non lethal dangers are
  ignored), and wait. From time to time it appears before the High
  Priest, in his dreams or in the real world. The worshippers often
  appear, and try to make him join them. Every time he a accepts
  being High Priest, the darkness of the Nameless God will absorb
  more of his mind. The process is finished when the High Priest
  performs his first completely voluntary sacrifice to the god.
   </p>
   <p>
    The only way of escaping priesthood is by being killed, and
  then the killer become new High Priest. Suicide is not an option,
  because the god will heal it. It will never give up, and the
  victim will never die. Escaping the Nameless God requires extreme
  cleverness, and even then its improbable.

    Manifestation of the Nameless God:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Nature: Silent

    <li>
     Demeanour: Silent
    </li>
   </ul>
   <b>
    Physical Traits:
   </b>
   None. The being never seems to
  interact with the physical world in any normal manner. It will
  move rather slowly most of the time (about walking speed), but
  can flow forward with a considerable speed if it wants.
   <p>
    <b>
     Mental Traits:
    </b>
    Probably none. The God does not
  communicate to anybody than the worshippers, and they just
  intuitively know what is expected of them.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Skills:
    </b>
    Probably none.

    </b>
    No apparent mind.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Paradox:
    </b>
    It doesn't seem to mind paradox, but never
  appears in public, preferring to meet its worshippers alone.

    Usually the god flows into a place from nowhere, probably a
  Correspondence/Spirit effect. It can also transport things which
  enter it (like a thrown knife or a car) to other places, or just
  let them disappear forever. It seems to be always aware of the
  whereabouts of its followers, and can give them intuitive
  knowledge of its wishes. It doesn't normally hurt people who
  wander into it, but they can wander forever inside the darkness
  and birdcries. Its not known if its just one being or several,
  since several pillars of darkness have been seen at the same
  time, but may be due to colocation of the being.
