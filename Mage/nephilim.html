   About The Fallen Ones, also Known as Nephilim.
   <p>
    By Frater IAM, Magister Templi of Ordo Rosae Crucis
   </p>
   <p>
    Fratres et Sorores, I will tonight speak of an odd group of
  beings, who don't seem to easily fit in with what we know about
  the rest of reality, at least from the views of some mages. These
  rare beings, variously known as the Nephilim or Fallen Ones are
  apparently independent Avatars, who move from person to person,
  capable of independent thought and magick.
   </p>
   <p>
    Their origin is unknown, although they explain themselves as
  formed out of the primal fields of Quintessence, moving through
  humanity in order to purify themselves and finally Ascend. Some
  mages believe they are the result of extremely potent magick
  which somehow has severed the link between a human and his
  avatar, maybe some form of Gilgul. Others claim the Nephilim are
  the result of mages straying so far from the path towards
  eventual Ascension that their Avatars fled to seek their own
  Ascension without their fallen hosts.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are four types of these beings, which correspond to the
  four elements and essences. Pattern and Earth, Questing and Fire,
  Dynamic and Air, Primordial and Water. The Nephilim seem to
  regard these divisions as very important, and their personalities
  often reflect their element. Fire beings tend towards violence,
  action and passion, while Earth beings tend towards stability,
  stubbornness and materialism. Its worth noting that they do not
  themselves believe in our notion of Avatar families.
   </p>
   <p>
    In most cases, the Nephilim are reincarnated into human bodies
  and spontaneously awaken either randomly or when subjected to the
  presence of strong magick. They rise to the conscious level, and
  take over the body of their host. The host consciousness seems to
  become suppressed by the power of his Avatar (they have sometimes
  been described as "inside out people"). The Fallen Ones seem to
  be unable to leave their bodies except at death, when they are
  reincarnated. Some escape their hosts by committing ritual
  suicide.
   </p>
   <p>
    Their magickal powers are roughly equal to a normal mage's,
  but they do not require foci. On the other hand, they seems to
  fear Paradox much more. It appears to cause them actual physical
  pain, and they usually rely on very subtle coincidental magick.
  Due to their long existences and close connection to magick, they
  are usually very powerful mages.
   </p>
   <p>
    The goal of the Nephilim seems to be mystical in nature. They
  appear to seek personal Ascension, mainly using mystical methods
  of meditation, gnosis or arcane study. In this matter they can
  sacrifice their current hosts, or anybody else standing in their
  way. In fact, they appear to search for enlightenment
  desperately, as if they were filled with a burning inner need for
  perfection. This supports the theory that they are escaped
  Avatars seeking Ascension on their own.
   </p>
   <p>
    How long have these beings existed? Nobody knows, but my
  research implies that they may have existed since ancient times,
  quite possibly before written history. Due to their
  reincarnation, they spend much time in an unconscious state deep
  within their hosts, and it appears that they can remain dormant
  through many incarnations. Some of them claim to have been famous
  people or even the truth behind the ancient Egyptian gods.
   </p>
   <p>
    Needless to say, different Traditions have very different
  views of the Fallen Ones. In my research I have discussed them
  with fellow scholars from the Celestial Chorus, Ahl-I-Batin,
  Euthanatos and Akashic Brotherhood. It was the Celestial Chorus
  who named them the Fallen Ones. According to their doctrines, the
  Nephilim are guardian angels who have stepped out of line,
  refusing to obey the dictates of the Highest and instead tried to
  reach Ascension by themselves instead by helping mankind. They
  are fallen, and will remain a disharmonious part of Creation
  until they realize that the only way towards Ascension is to
  follow the divine Will.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Ahl-I-Batin scholars I met called them the Watchers, the
  First Race or sometimes the Djinn. According to the Koran, Allah
  first created these beings but had later forsaken them for
  humanity, who showed greater promise and had free will. There is
  a warning in one of the suras of the Koran against any contact
  between the races, on the penalty of eternal damnation. However,
  due to the great magickal prowess of the Djinn some human
  sorcerers apparently summoned them to use them, allowing them
  access to our plane of existence. The Ahl-I-Batin apparently do
  their best to trace the escaped Watchers (so named because they
  see all of our reality from their own plane) and bring them back
  into the fold.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Euthanatos actively hunt the Nephilim. They regard them as
  one of the worst perversions of existence known, a Kia who has
  been polluted by the lower will of a incarnation and now moves
  along the wheel polluting new reincarnations. The Euthanatos
  apparently seeks to capture them and subject them to Gilgul in
  order to prevent further contamination.
   </p>
   <p>
    The scholar of the Akashic Brotherhood I discussed with
  claimed that the Fallen Ones were an almost purely western
  phenomenon and were practically unknown in the east for some
  reason. He speculated that the widespread belief in reincarnation
  somehow limited their activity, but this seems doubtful. Another
  explanation which may or may not be true, is that the Fallen Ones
  were once defeated in the east and driven west. However, nobody
  have any idea of when this happened, who did it and why.
   </p>
   <p>
    To sum up, the Fallen Ones or Nephilim, are among the most
  bizarre beings our Order have ever encountered. They doesn't seem
  to fit in with our current theories of the nature of the Avatar,
  and might even be something else all together. Their magickal
  powers are great, making them fearsome adversaries and powerful
  allies. Their single-minded seeking of Ascension is both
  fascinating and most dangerous, perhaps best seen as a warning
  against letting the Seeking overcome our humanity.
