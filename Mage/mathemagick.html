   <a name="HILL">
    Dr Robert Hill
   </a>
  </h1>
  Doctor Hill is among
  the most dangerous enemies of the Virtual Adepts in the
  Technocracy, especially because he appears to be so innocuous.
  What could a Void Engineer mathematician do against the masters
  of information? But the Virtual Adepts have begun to realise that
  he may be a bigger threat against their vision than the entire
  New World Order. Because Dr Hill is redefining reality against
  Virtual Adept Ascension.
  <p>
   Dr Hill is not even well known among mathematicians outside
  his own field, Automata and Complexity Theory. But those
  mathematicians and computer scientists who know of him, are
  generally very impressed. His theories and proofs are
  masterpieces of cold elegance, defining and exploring what is
  possible for computers to do, and what is not. Few realise that
  his theorems about the computational power of generalised Turing
  Machines also limits the abilities of the computers of the
  Virtual Adepts and Sons of Ether. He has ruthlessly demonstrated
  certain mathematical problems which cannot be solved using any
  computer, or that they cannot ever be solved faster than certain
  bounds. To most mathematicians this is just fascinating ideas,
  but to the Virtual Adepts this is a direct and deadly attack. Dr
  Hill is successively narrowing down the paradigm regarding what
  is computable and not, and apparently seeks to once and for all
  define immutable limits on all forms of computation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Naturally, Dr Hill has met with some resistance. While most of
  the Traditions, including many Virtual Adepts, don't realise the
  danger he poses, the Chaoticians fight him at every opportunity.
  They wage an abstract war against Dr Hill and his followers in
  mathematical journals, on conferences and in the computer science
  community. Dr Hill fights back, both using his dreaded precision
  and eye for any flaws in an argument, and the more subtle support
  by the Technocracy. Strangely, the Chaotician papers have trouble
  getting published while the supporters of Hill almost always get
  into prestigious journals. There have even been some direct
  attempts on his persona, but Dr Hill has an uncanny ability to
  never be where he ought to be. Tracking him is almost
  impossible.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite his intimidating reputation among the Chaoticians, Dr
  Hill is rather unremarkable when met in person. He is a short,
  middle aged man with balding hair and horn-rimmed glasses. He
  speaks fast and precisely, never ending lecturing or explaining
  things to his audience. His humour is dry and usually only
  comprehensible for other mathematicians, although he politely
  smiles to any attempts at joking. He would disappear into the
  academic crowd if it wasn't for his charisma: his presence is
  *felt*. Its not known where he lives or if he has an family,
  somehow investigations never turn up anything.
  </p>
  <p>
   Among the Void Engineers, Dr Hill is a major figure. Although
  the convention is most known for its space research, all forms of
  basic science is its domain. Dr Hill is the Research Director of
  the Mathematics Research Group (
   <a href="Mage/mathemagick.html#MRG">
    MRG
   </a>
   ,
  also called the Mathemagicians by others), which deals with the
  continued development of mathematics and related sciences like
  logic and statistics. The
   <a href="Mage/mathemagick.html#MRG">
    MRG
   </a>
   cooperates with many other groups in the Technocracy,
  most notably the Particle Physics Research Group (PPRG),
  Iteration X and the statistics department of the NWO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dr Hill is very respected among the Void Engineers, where he
  has an influential role. Although the space division isn't as
  involved in mathematics as it used to be, it realises the
  importance of Hills work. Iteration X is also interested in it,
  but a bit ambivalent (if that is possible for them) due to some
  of the limitations his theories could place upon their paradigm.
  The New World Order is quite happy with his work, especially
  since he helped them design the provably safe operating system
  for their computers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dr Hill himself is a careful man. He is very intelligent, and
  has long ago learned the risks and benefits of being an
  administrator in the Technocracy, not to mention how far the
  rules can be bent or manipulated. He is also convinced that the
  Technocracy represents the only hope for mankind; without its
  stability and efficiency, the world would degenerate into
  despicable chaos and decay. Most of the Traditions are not any
  real dangers, since their paradigms are so far from the consensus
  that very few people would seek them. But the Virtual Adepts
  represents a subtle danger. By riding piggyback on the
  Technocracy paradigm, they have managed to gain more power and
  influence than is acceptable and safe. Their visions are
  dangerous, because they could convince the Masses in the
  beginning, and eventually lead to disastrous consequences.
  Therefore Dr. Hill has embarked on a personal quest to stop them
  long before they get any chance to fight back.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chaos theory is another area Dr Hill is doing his best to deal
  with. He cannot do anything about it (his predecessor as Research
  Director of the
   <a href="Mage/mathemagick.html#MRG">
    MRG
   </a>
   let for some inscrutable reason the area develop too far
  before stepping in, and then it was too late), but he has
  appointed a research team to try to bring some control over
  chaos. Another worry is the area of Differential Geometry. Some
  recent results have disturbing implications, although so far just
  Dr Hill and some of his trusted colleagues have noticed it. These
  results show a definite Nephandi influence, implying the
  existence of strange and threatening structures both in
  mathematics and in physical reality. Dr Hill is secretly trying
  to trace the theorems to their source.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dr Hill is a frightening opponent. Although he might not be
  dangerous on the physical plane, his influence over consensus
  reality is strong. Given some time, he can disprove any theory he
  doesn't like or add defences to consensus reality against most
  effects. He is slowly sealing all holes in reality, making it
  orderly and logical. Inside it there will be no room for
  Ascension.

  <h1>
   <a name="MRG">
    Mathematics Research Group (MRG, the
  Mathemagicians)
   </a>
  </h1>
  The mathematical branch of the Void
  Engineers headed by
  <a href="Mage/mathemagick.html#HILL">
   Dr Hill
  </a>
  is little known by the Traditions, but they are a
  vital part of the Technocracy. They develop new methods for use
  in the research oriented conventions, control the academic
  disciplines related to mathematics and constantly research the
  implications of sleeper mathematics to avoid possible threats to
  the paradigm. They have strong ties to the Statisticians of
  Iteration X and the Forecasters.
  <p>
   The group is in fact quite old, among the oldest parts of the
  Technocracy. Its earliest roots can be traced back to the
  Pythagoreans, although the group mainly developed during the late
  renaissance. Originally it mainly dealt with developing the
  necessary mathematics for astronomy, helped such giants as
  Newton, Gauss and Laplace. It later diversified as the utility of
  mathematics became apparent, and different subgroups split of and
  became their own disciplines (like the Statisticians or the
  logic- theorists which latter evolved into the Virtual Adepts).
  Today its very respected and so taken for granted by everyone in
  the Technocracy that its existence is almost forgotten.
  </p>
  <p>
   Most mathematicians spend their time studying sleeper
  mathematics, writing research papers or participating on various
  conferences to direct mathematical development in the right
  direction. They are among the most anonymous technomancers
  possible, practically impossible to discover. Their various
  amalgams deal with specific areas, such as cryptography (another
  area where
   <a href="Mage/mathemagick.html#HILL">
    Dr Hill
   </a>
   fights the Virtual Adepts), topology, numerical
  analysis, combinatorics and all other mathematical disciplines.
  Its common for other conventions to approach them with specific
  problems they need solved.
  </p>
  <p>
   Their philosophy is simple: develop mathematics and
  mathematical models to encompass all of reality. When this has
  been done, everything will be essentially orderly and stable
  (although not necessarily computable or predictable). Mathematics
  is pure thought which can be given physical form. Some
  mathemagicians believe that reality itself follows from a
  mathematical basis, and try to develop a model for it.
  </p>
  <p>
   Most technomancers of the MRG specialises in Entropy, the
  study of complex systems and probability, or Prime, the study of
  structures. Other valued spheres are Mind (to gain better control
  over one's mental processes), Correspondence (the study of
  geometry) and Time (planning and optimisation). They use complex
  mathematical formalism to use the spheres, often combined with
  extensive computer simulations if the problem involves Entropy.
  They don't use any direct magick, preferring to integrate it into
  the paradigm instead. This makes them almost immune to paradox.
  They also use their mathematics defensively: they can easily
  point out how improbable certain things are or find flaws in
  coincidences.

   Relations to other conventions

  <dl>
   <dt>
    New World Order
   </dt>
   <dd>
    They need our models and algorithms more than anybody else,
    and always consult us. We are swamped in requests for
    statistics, logistical analysis, encryption and decryption
    schemes, not to mention their obsession with mathematical
    models of societies and people.
   </dd>
   <dt>
    The Syndicate
   </dt>
   <dd>
    They are unfortunately not very good at mathematics, and
    their laughably inaccurate theories complicate things a lot.
    What they need is once and for all to define their axioms and
    then stick to them.
   </dd>
   <dt>
    Iteration X
   </dt>
   <dd>
    They apply our mathematics. While some sleeper
    mathematicians see applied mathematics as something impure, we
    realise the need for it. And Iteration X has realised the need
    for precision.
   </dd>
   <dt>
    Progenitors
   </dt>
   <dd>
    They rely mainly on some combinatorics and lately on
    knot-theory. Usually they just consult us to improve their own
    models.

    Void Engineers
   </dt>
   <dd>
    We seek to plumb and fill out the last voids of knowledge,

    other parts of our convention deal with the material aspects of
    it, while we take care of the abstractions.

  "Isn't it surprising how mathematical the world
  is?"
  <h2>
   <a name="rotes">
    Rotes
   </a>
  </h2>
  The MRG develop solutions and
  rotes for other conventions. In fact, many of the most common
  rotes (like the Time-Motion Study of Iteration X) were originally
  developed by the MRG. However, most of their rotes are just used
  as integral parts of other rotes (like the Fast Fourier Transform
  or the differential geometry used by Void Engineer warp drives)
  or incorporated into consensus reality.
  <h3>
   Model Structure (Mind 1 Prime 1 Sphere 1)
  </h3>
  By examining a
  system, the mathemagician can create a mathematical model of it.
  Using this model he can then simulate its behaviour, often in
  conjunction to other rotes. He can also monitor the differences
  between the model and reality (using Entropy 1) to see if there
  are unknown factors or manipulation involved.
  <h3>
   Catastrophe Theory (Time 2 Entropy 1)
  </h3>
  By analysing a
  system, a mathemagician can predict when it will suffer any
  drastic change in structure or behaviour, usually called a
  catastrophe. This can be used to predict the exact moment
  something will fail, someone will change his mind or paradox to
  strike.
  <h3>
   Optimisation (Entropy 3 Time 2)
  </h3>
  This is so common in the
  technocracy that few realise the origin of the rote. Essentially
  it allows the user to optimise something by calculating the
  optimum way to do it, removing all random or irrelevant factors
  and making the system orderly and predictable.
  <p>
   [Each success will decrease difficulty by one or add one
  success to any task which can be optimised, such as designing a
  system, running a bank or sabotaging an installation. However, in
  order to work the task must succeed on its own.]
  </p>
  <h3>
   Complexify (Entropy 3)
  </h3>
  Often the Technocracy do not want
  others to understand the inner workings of their devices or their
  theories. It would for example be disastrous if some future
  technology got into the hands of the Masses. Therefore the MRG
  has developed a general way of making theories, objects or rotes
  more complex and harder to understand partially based on
  coding-theory. By randomly mixing the parts and introducing
  self-organising elements they can make the simplest structure so
  complicated that it will become impossible to understand, while
  still working as it should.
  <p>
   [ Each success adds two to the difficulty in understanding how
  the target works. The rote must be used when it is designed or
  constructed, it won't work on a finished system. ]
  </p>
  <h3>
   Logical Loop (Mind 3 Prime 2)
  </h3>
  This is essentially a
  computer virus developed by the logic research team and the
  psychologists of the NWO. It is a small set of postulates, which
  will quickly overload any logical system capable of understanding
  them (mainly computers, but human mathematicians or programmers
  are vulnerable) by constantly expanding itself and increasing in
  complexity without ever repeating. It has proven very efficient
  against Virtual Adepts, who often tend to think in slightly
  computerlike ways.
  <p>
   [The Loop will quickly expand and fill out all available
  processor power and memory of a computer which starts to
  interpret it correctly. Humans must understand the Loop (requires
  Computer 3, Enigmas 4 or Mathematics 3), and will then be
  partially infected. Usually it will only lead to a minor
  obsession of thinking through its implications (which never end),
  but in severe cases the victim becomes catatonic. If it
  successfully infects the mind of a victim, it will drain as many
  Willpower points as its successes as the victim can't resist
  thinking about it. After a while, the victim will get a new
  Willpower test, and if he fails the loop drains some more
  Willpower. If Willpower reaches zero the victim goes into
  catatonia until somehow freed from the Loop. ]
  </p>
  <h3>
   Coordinator Structure (Entropy 4 Spirit 4 +other
  sphere)
  </h3>
  This is one of the most advanced results of the
  complexity research team. They found, that under very general
  circumstances physical (or other) systems of sufficient
  complexity could be subtly manipulated to contain a
  self-organising mathematical structure called a Coordinator
  Structure. These structures are essentially a built-in control
  system, which can be designed to perform various actions
  depending on circumstances. For example, the semi-random
  behaviour of an ecosystem can be kept within certain bounds by
  adding a Coordinator Structure, or the fluctuations of the Market
  could in principle be controlled using self-sustaining
  Coordinator Structures (the Syndicate has vetoed this). The New
  World Order has expressed great interest in Coordinator
  Structures, and are studying if they could be integrated within
  the human mind.
  <p>
   [ The system has to be complex enough to exhibit
  self-organisation. The mathemagician carefully analyses it,
  develops a mathematical model and creates the Coordinator
  Structure using subtle manipulations. It is necessary for the
  responsible research team to know the necessary system well
  enough to control it in some aspects (Forces 2/4, Matter 3, Life
  2-4, Mind 2/3, etc.). The structure can fulfil simple commands
  within the system, like keeping it orderly, minimise certain
  factors or optimise others. Any sufficiently strong fluctuation
  will destroy it. ]
  </p>
  <h3>
   Daleth Deciphering (Entropy 5)
  </h3>
  The coding experts of the
  Technocracy and the Virtual Adepts fight each other by creating
  ever more secure ciphers and by cracking the others codes. The
  MRG has develop a series of codes based upon curves in
  Teichmüller spaces called epsilon-codes while the Virtual
  Adepts have perfected public-key codes. Both sides however
  realise that any code can be broken by using sufficient amounts
  of brute force and ingenuity. In fact, the MRG has developed a
  very general deciphering scheme named daleth deciphering, based
  on huge amounts of computing power and their most ingenious
  algorithms. It can be shown that it can decode all possible codes
  in a finite time, but the process usually takes a long time and
  requires the most acute minds of the Technocracy to work well.
  The Virtual Adepts fight this by trying to make sleepers use
  encryption too, so that their own messages are hidden by a
  torrent of other encrypted messages. The NWO and Iteration X are
  jointly developing an expert system using Daleth Deciphering to
  meet this threat.
  <h3>
   Gödel Openings (Entropy 5 Prime 4)
  </h3>
  Kurt Gödel
  demonstrated that any sufficiently complex mathematical system
  contained theorems whose truth couldn't be proved. This was at
  once a blow to the Technocracy, and an opportunity to expand its
  reach. The mathemagicians have found that by judiciously
  exploiting known holes in accepted theories, technomancers can
  use magickal effects normally not allowed while still not
  contradicting the theory (and incurring paradox). To find these
  "Gödel Openings" extensive computer simulations and tweaking
  of the model is needed, which usually requires the help of the
  sharpest minds of the MRG. In exchange, it is possible to find
  situations or methods which make certain operations permissible
  even if they are not part of the paradigm. This makes it possible
  to do some work normally done in Horizon realms on Earth instead,
  which is much more economical.
  <p>
   The desired effect must not be directly vulgar (against the
  laws of consensus reality), but doesn't have to be coincidental.
  A typical example would be the use of nanotechnology; its
  currently not in the paradigm, and its capabilities are as yet
  undefined. By modelling the paradigm and modifying the effect
  slightly, the mathemagicians can find circumstances where the
  nanotechnology would work even if its not part of the paradigm. A
  necessary part of this is to make sure the effect will not leave
  unambiguous traces if the paradigm should change so that the
  effect was never possible. In the example, the nanotechnology
  have to be possible to explain away as biotechnology or something
  similar if it later turns out that the symposium decides it
  should be scrapped.
  </p>
  <p>
   [ If the rote succeeds, a set of related vulgar without
  witnesses effects can be made coincidental. ]

   Provably Safe operating System ****
  </h3>
  Dr
  <a href="Mage/mathemagick.html#HILL">
   Hill
  </a>
  has managed to construct, together with the NWO, an
  operating system which is totally safe. It is mathematically
  proven (and verified) that this system *cannot* be broken from
  the outside; it is a mathematical impossibility. The NWO uses it
  as a defence against the Virtual Adepts, despite its drawbacks.
  Its very slow and unwieldy, and writing applications for it taxes
  the skills of the best programmers in the Technocracy. But safety
  before economics, as the NWO says.
  <p>
   [ The operating system is based upon a complex web of
  interlocking codes, consistency checks and an ingenious use of
  zero-knowledge proofs. The only way to crack it is either by
  subverting its system operator or by using vulgar magick. The NWO
  has linked it to a paradox detectors. ]
