Subject: Theurgy

I loved the Theurgy article; it was the final ingredient needed to truly
integrate the various paradigms into a role-playing-friendly format.

As you mentioned, it is difficult to come up with a theurgy for the Hollow
Ones and the Sons of Ether.  This is simply because these tow Traditions are
so individualistic in nature that a basic theurgy is different for each
mage.  However, this is my attempt; I hope you all like it.

SONS OF ETHER

"Science cannot save us unless we believe in it."
                -Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News

For the Sons of Ether, perfection of their personal scientific paradigms is
the center of their lives, and each experiment that furthers that paradigm
is its own theurgical ceremony.  

Each Etherist is different in his/her believs, so each Etherist's theurgy
will be very different.  One which believes in beta wave theory will perform
experiments to prove that all things are based off of waves, and each
successful experiment is a successful theurgy; one which believes in
particle/energy transduction will perform experiments in alteration, and
each successfull experiment is a theurgy.  

In the end, theurgy for the Sons of Ether is personal and, in a way, fun.
While Sons of Ether believe in science, they believe in a personal science,
designed for the experimenter alone.  Science is supposed to be a matter of
discovery, wonder and, in the end, fun.  When science is fun, it becomes a
unique theurgy for a unique Tradition.
