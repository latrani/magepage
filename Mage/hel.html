   <h2>
    The Wolf, The Wyrm, and The Witch
   </h2>
   "Loki had other
  children besides. There was a giantess Angrbodha, the Ill-Boding,
  from Jotunheim. Loki had three children with her, the first was
  Fenris-wolf, the second, Joermungand, the Midgard serpent, and
  the third, Hel. The gods knew that they were being raised among
  the giants and learned from prophesies that they would bring
  great evil. Thus the All-father Odin commanded some of the Aesir
  to go seize the children and bring them before him. When they
  came, Odin flung the serpent into the ocean depths where it grew
  to encircle the entire world of men, biting its own tail."
   <p>
    "Then he cast Hel to Niflheim, giving her authority over nine
  worlds, so long as she shared her provisions with all who were
  sent to her, those who die from sickness or age. She has a great
  keep there, with towering walls and gates. Her hall is
  Damp-with-Sleet; her plate is Hunger and her knife Famine. Her
  servants are the Shambling Man and the Lurching Woman. Hel is
  half black, half flesh-color and she is easily known from this.
  She looks quite grim."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Fenris, the gods raised among themselves..."
   </p>
   <p>
    (Adapted from the
    <em>
     Gylfaginningsaga
    </em>
    )
   </p>
   <p>
    Who are they really? Hel's Daughters, the Ice Maidens, the
  Winter Witches... Those few who know of them wonder, and they
  will most likely keep wondering, for the Helsdottir are as
  inscrutable as glaciers and often as inexorable. Of the
  speculators on their origins, some say they are merely another
  cursed bloodline, perhaps of Nosferatu, that inspired the myth of
  Hel, whereas others believe they are the actual Children of the
  Lady of Niflheim, asking themselves what relations these "get" of
  Hel have with their metaphorical Lupine cousins. Still others
  doubt they are Kindred at all, merely something outwardly
  similar. It's a compelling topic -- those familiar with Garou
  lore cannot help but think of the second child, the great
  serpent, the Wyrm?
   </p>
   <p>
    Sadly for the cause of knowledge, neither the Wyrm, the
  Dottir, or the Get are saying much about this strange kinship
  suggested in the old sagas, although if you ask a Get of Fenris
  about it, you are certain to get a reply. It's just that you'll
  never get a chance to tell anyone what it was.
   </p>
   <p>
    What is commonly known of the Helsdottir is that they are
  creatures of ice, and snow, and winter. Beings of the rime-frost
  and arctic blast, shadowy courtiers of death who stand between
  this world and the next, bridging the twain with abominable
  sorceries. They are as the draugar, the barrow wights, feeding
  off the living in the long dark northern nights. They can be
  hideous. From one side, a beautiful woman, from the other a
  shrivelled corpse. Even the undead feel too much of the grave
  about them for comfort. Wraiths shudder before them. The
  Wyrm-creatures? Don't be silly -- they don't bother the minions
  of the Wyrm -- they just don't have any good use for them, that's
  all...
   </p>
   <p>
    Surprisingly, this is not far from the truth.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Ways and Means
   </h2>
   Helsdottir obey Odin's proviso: By
  tradition, the Dottir never turn away those "who are sent to
  them." Though, the precise meaning of this is often a matter of
  opinion.
   <p>
    They are rarely found below the 55th parallel. These secretive
  Kindred mostly dwell in the arctic, although a minority have
  their abodes in chilly regions near the south pole. A few have
  established themselves in high mountainous regions where
  permanent snow caps are at hand. Havens are usually in remote
  areas, where they spend most of their time, although younger and
  weaker individuals must exist nearer human habitation for feeding
  purposes. It is rumored that a small number of elders have
  achieved Golconda or something like it and have settled in the
  frozen wastes of Antarctica where they explore vast and
  incomprehensible magics.
   </p>
   <p>
    Rituals are a continual preoccupation of the Dottir. Much like
  the Garou, they have rituals for every occasion, most of which
  don't really have any specific magical effect. Very often, these
  rituals are reenactments of mythological and cultic themes, and
  Dottir will sometimes go to great lengths to prepare some
  particular aspect of the recreation. Visitors and those seeking
  favors are often insistently "invited" to portray a particular
  character which they happen to resemble. On the rare occasion
  when a Lupine peaceably interacts with them, the creature is
  asked without fail to take on Hispo form to portray Fenris
  (though seldom is it informed of the role Frey's sword plays in
  the myth - ouch!)
   </p>
   <h2>
    Society
   </h2>
   All younger Helsdottir usually give their names
  as "Hel", much to the consternation and confusion of those few
  who encounter them. For some time after the Embrace, they lack a
  strong sense of individuality and often are much like apprentices
  to elder Helsdottir. Only when they get older do they become more
  independent. At some point, a Helsdottir will receive a personal
  name, usually after accomplishing some difficult task. This is
  similar to being considered an Ancilla among the Camarilla. The
  early decades (or even centuries) are important for learning the
  bloodline's intricate corpus of ritual, myth, and legend.
   <p>
    The elder members, as in most clans, coordinate any collective
  actions. When they gather, it is usually for the purpose of
  conducting rituals. Otherwise, they meet only rarely.
   </p>
   <p>
    Relations with most clans are minimal. Mostly only Gangrel
  ever encounter them, usually at a distance. When Nosferatu happen
  upon them they often display fascination with these half-hideous,
  half-beautiful creatures. Tremere are naturally curious, and
  sometimes are brought into contact with them through a mutual
  interest in the occult, although Dottir guard their knowledge,
  especially that of rune magic, even more jealously than do the
  Tremere. The necromantic Giovanni are rather suspicious of their
  abilities in death magic, but their paths seldom cross.
   </p>
   <p>
    Only on the rarest occasions may a Helsdottir actually seek an
  individual of another clan for some purpose. There is one thing
  which will always draw their attention though. Caine. Even the
  slightest rumor of him merits at least a cursory examination.
  There exist certain members of the Dottir who have learned the
  Obfuscate discipline to more easily move within populated areas
  to investigate especially promising leads. Such occasions are
  frequently accompanied by mysteriously unseasonable cold
  spells.
   </p>
   <p>
    They do not have any sort of formal recognition of the
  Masquerade and do not consider themselves part of the Camarilla,
  but their secretive ways usually don't provoke much publicity.
  Occasional human kills are usually not discovered until well
  after spring thaw, when tell-tale evidence of blood loss is long
  gone or fairly unnoticeable. Death by exposure is hardly unusual
  during the arctic winter.
   </p>
   <p>
    As the Dottir dwell far from the Jyhad (some even say that the
  mythical Hel takes steps to insulate them from it), they
  sometimes traffic a bit with the Inconnu, who have similar tastes
  in a remote lifestyle. A few of the eldest Helsdottir are said to
  be members for all practical purposes.
   </p>
   <p>
    Garou, whom the Dottir often call "Vargulfar" (Warg-wolves),
  actually see them more frequently than other Kindred, but are
  mostly unaware of what they are, frequently mistaking them for
  spirits of one sort or another. At any rate, the tundra-dwelling
  Helsdottir are hardly a great driving force of human expansion
  and so are not generally considered a significant threat by Garou
  in the know. Get of Fenris that have some idea what the Dottir
  are will ignore the presence of a Helsdottir as though she
  weren't there and may become quite annoyed with anyone who
  troubles to point her out. Oddly, Get are the only Garou in which
  they show much interest, often observing them motionless at a
  distance, camouflaged to near invisibility against the snow by
  their peculiar Discipline and disappearing at the first sign that
  any take notice.

   <h2>
    Outlooks
   </h2>
   The Helsdottir worldview is very similar to
  Norse/Germanic mythology, with a strong emphasis on magic. Magic
  is somewhere between a religion and an art form for them. They
  consequently look down upon Tremere blood magic as crude. The
  Tremere too often see it as a mere tool, they say. Tradition
  mages are little better: their problems with paradox are no
  wonder with the slapdash way they attempt to use magic. The
  essence of magic must be skillfully guided and subtly woven. It's
  an intricate dance and one who does not follow the music is sure
  to step on some feet.
   <p>
    An integral part of Norse mythology is the belief in Ragnarok,
  essentially the end of the world. Some of the details of this
  event are given in the PLAYING THE DOTTIR section. Unlike most
  WoD denizens, the Dottir do not imagine their final apocalypse to
  be imminent, though they do make ritual preparations for it.
  Hel's role in the Ragnarok is not great, though Fenris and
  Joermungand both have significant parts. All three fight against
  the gods in alliance with the giants and assorted monstrous
  beings. The general belief is that the old gods are so weak in
  this age that Ragnarok would be rather pointless. Hel, Fenris,
  and Joermungand all have maintained strong presences in the world
  and as such do not feel the need to destroy it just yet. Perhaps
  in the next age though.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Looks
   </h2>
   They frequently seem to be Scandinavian in origin
  but are by no means exclusively so. They are occasionally drawn
  from Inuits, Aleuts, Lapps, and other northern peoples as well,
  especially in the case of younger Helsdottir. These
  non-Scandinavian members tend to hold somewhat variant
  interpretations of their lore based on their native cultures.
   <p>
    Style of dress may depend largely on time and place of
  embrace, although many prefer minimalism in this respect, wearing
  little more than a cloak or long shawl, if that. Helsdottir are
  for all practical purposes immune to the effects of cold and
  generally don't need to worry about maintaining appearances in
  their usual territories. Amulets and mystical bric-a-brac are
  almost de rigueur though. Ritual costumes can be quite elaborate,
  and heavy concealing winter wear is the rule near mortal
  habitations. The invention of the ski mask was considered very
  fortunate among those who find it necessary to operate around
  civilized areas.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Estivation
   </h2>
   They frequently estivate, that is to undergo a
  kind of summer equivalent of hibernation, since the "midnight
  sun" is not particularly salubrious for their complexions. They
  rule, however, the seemingly interminable winter nights. When the
  summer nights shorten to a certain point, they simply go into a
  light sleeplike torpor in a secluded place, often in chambers in
  the permafrost or in the deep perpetual snows of high mountains.
  Their metabolisms are such that they do not use blood during this
  torpid state as would be the case with other vampires. If they
  emerge from this special torpor prematurely, however, they may
  not reenter it until the following year. Normal awakening takes
  place as many days after the solstice as days before which it
  began.
   <p>
    &gt;From the vernal equinox to the autumnal equinox (reversed
  in the southern hemisphere) they are rather difficult to wake, as
  if they had one humanity point less than they do. At Humanity of
  1, they just don't wake up for anything, unless someone carts
  them off to the opposite hemisphere.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Embrace
   </h2>
   The Helsdottir pick only women who have died
  non-violent deaths for the embrace. The Ritual of Embrace is long
  and complex. When a candidate expires and is buried, a quorum of
  nine gathers at the next new moon to watch the corpse at the
  gravesite throughout the next nine nights, whispering invocations
  to Hel, as the departed, it is believed, journeys to Niflheim to
  meet the death goddess Hel face to face. On the ninth night the
  body is exhumed and fed the mixed blood of the eldest and they
  say "Sister Modhgudh, she who crosses the Gjoell is one with us."
  After which the body is taken to a secret place in the wilderness
  and exposed to the light of the moon for the next nine nights. As
  the vigil goes on, she takes on the characteristic visage, the
  left side seeming alive and youthful, even so as to grow younger
  in appearance if she was old at the time of death. The right side
  conversely begins to wither and decay, more rapidly than it
  ought.
   <p>
    Finally the initiate awakes, fully transformed, and speaks the
  ancient formula, spoken by the trickster Loki in his guise as the
  giantess Thoekk, "Let Hel hold what she has."
   </p>
   <p>
    Neonates display very little personality or self-will, perhaps
  the result of having been dead for half a month or more. As they
  grow older and more powerful, they become more "human," if the
  term is appropriate.
   </p>
   <p>
    Only the Ritual allows the blood to work in this manner. They
  cannot otherwise embrace the long-dead. As one might expect, it
  is possible for them to embrace the newly dead, but this produces
  neither Helsdottir nor Caitiff. The disturbance of the powerful
  mystical resonances carried in their vitae shatters the soul of
  the improperly embraced and the corpse arises stripped of all
  reason and Humanity, a frothing Beast, and what's more, a Beast
  endowed with not only the normal vampiric powers but the powers
  of the first five levels of the Hel's Will discipline (very
  dangerous). It becomes a Draugr, a mindless undead beast with a
  ravenous hunger for human lives.
   </p>
   <p>
    These misbegotten creatures are not common, but when they have
  been created through some mishap, the memory of their savage
  depredations can persist in local lore for centuries after they
  are dispatched, that is when they are dispatched. One unfortunate
  case in which a Dottir who had fallen to the Beast embraced a
  mortal man in this manner was brought to an end by the
  now-legendary Danish warrior Beowulf, after an extended reign of
  terror and bloodlust.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Blood
   </h2>
   The vitae of Helsdottir sometimes betrays a hint of
  Gangrel in its taste, but there's something not quite right about
  it. Diablerie works on them but the diabolist will become a bit
  queasy afterwards. The diabolist's willpower should be rolled. On
  a botch the diabolist's blood becomes seriously tainted and the
  ghastly physical transformation of the Dottir takes hold. A
  failure indicates a crippling illness that persists for a number
  of days equal to the blood points consumed (the character is
  incapacitated). Success results in no adverse effect. When a
  Dottir diablerizes one of another bloodline or clan, a similar
  roll is made. However, in this case, a botch indicates that the
  Dottir becomes a Draugr, as after an improper embrace. (See the
  SECRET OF HEL for an explanation of this.)
   <h2>
    Moon
   </h2>
   Helsdottir maintain some supernatural connection to
  the moon. The half that appears corpselike varies depending on
  whether the moon is waxing or waning. The live side corresponds
  to the bright side of the moon and the dead side, the dark. At
  the precise moment of the full moon they appear fully human for a
  brief instant. At the new moon, they predictably become all
  corpse.
   <h2>
    Discipline
   </h2>
   Dottir practice an unusual discipline, termed
  variously cryurgy, cryomancy, or thermostasis by outsiders,
  though they themselves usually just call it Hel's Will.
   <p class="c1">
    O - Whiteskin
   </p>
   <p>
    This most basic element of the discipline allows the Dottir to
  transform her skin into a near-perfect thermal insulator. It
  becomes completely reflective such that the skin is totally white
  and smoother surfaces such as the eyes and hair are almost
  mirrorlike. The eyes still admit sufficient light to see by,
  particularly when using Auspex or Protean, but night vision is
  really not as good as in most Kindred in this state, being no
  better than a mortal's. Tactile sensation is also somewhat
  hindered and sense of temperature is completely cut off.
   </p>
   <p>
    In this form their appearance is shocking, to say the least.
  It makes them totally resistant to cold as well as making them
  nearly impossible to spot against a snowfield. In addition, it
  provides limited protection from sunlight and heat sources such
  as fire, although such things erode the vampiric power which
  produces the effect so that this protection is no more effective
  than the Fortitude discipline, providing as many soak dice as the
  level in the discipline. This heat resistance has come as an
  unpleasant surprise to those who have simplistically assumed that
  fire must be a particularly effective weapon against such frigid
  entities; water boils quicker than ice. Note that it does not
  provide other Fortitude benefits such as extra soak dice for
  other types of damage or any protection against aggravated
  damage. It's not that powerful. An odd side effect that may
  rarely be significant is that the skin is as effective an
  electrical insulator as it is a thermal insulator.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, as they are normally quite cold resistant, even
  without the discipline, they tend only to use it at lower
  temperatures, such as under -10 Fahrenheit or when other
  circumstances may make it useful. Temperatures over 50 Fahrenheit
  tend to be rather uncomfortable to them, so they are likely to
  use it in such environs as well.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    OO - Winterwalk
   </p>
   <p>
    This is a relatively simple ability. The Dottir will never
  slip on ice or break through it and can walk on the surface of
  snow without ever sinking in. They can essentially glide
  effortlessly along all manner of frozen surfaces at the
  approximate running speed of a mortal, like a ghost.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    OOO - Mask of Hel
   </p>
   <p>
    This power is at the core of their reputation for
  inscrutability. The Dottir with this level of the discipline
  becomes supernaturally impassive, unreadable. Mundane uses of
  subterfuge and perceptive skills will never reveal anything about
  the emotional state of the Dottir based on tone of voice,
  expression, posture, or other such cues. Use of abilities of the
  vampiric Auspex discipline such as Aura Perception can penetrate
  it if the perceiver has more discipline dots than the perceived.
  This operates in the same manner as the Obfuscate-Auspex
  opposition, potentially blocking Spirit Touch and Telepathy as
  well. It also adds dice to Frenzy and Roetschreck rolls at one
  die per dot in the discipline. For affect-altering disciplines
  such as Presence it adds one die per dot to the resistance roll
  if one is allowed, and actually permits an opposition roll based
  on the Hel's Will score if no resistance roll is normally
  possible (e.g. Presence - Possession). Successes on this roll
  subtract from successes on the aggressor's roll. In short, the
  more powerful Dottir are practically emotional and spiritual
  blanks. Note that the mental effects of Dominate are
    <em>
     not
    </em>
    resisted by this ability. On the down side, however, the Dottir
  cannot use the Empathy skill while in this state. Any action
  involving the Empathy score will go as if the Empathy rating were
  0.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    OOOO - Hospitality
   </p>
   <p>
    This ability allows the user to extend the benefits of the
  first three levels of Hel's Will (most definitely not the higher
  ones) to a group of companions, the number of which is equal to
  the number of dots in the discipline. It requires the expenditure
  of a blood point and functions only within the range of
  sight.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    OOOOO - Wind of Niflheim
   </p>
   <p>
    This is the first ability which actually has a direct effect
  on the Dottir's environment. She gains the ability to summon
  freezing blast of wind from the wastes of Niflheim. As one might
  imagine, this is not an easy thing to do and costs a blood point.
  The gust blows through her immediate vicinity, lowering
  temperatures by 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Just to make things
  simple, say that water will freeze if this drops the temperature
  below 10 F, naturally modified by the quantity. This is one of
  those "do what seems reasonable for a gust from the land of
  death" things. It can make things quite chilly on a cold night.
  It effectively stuns all cold-susceptible creatures (including
  vampires who will stiffen a bit) for a round and puts them on the
  road to frostbite, often even leaving a thin layer of frost on
  exposed surfaces. It's not just cold, it's a deathly chill. The
  wind may be directed at specific targets using Dexterity + Occult
  as per combat with firearms.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    OOOOOO - Ice Dominion
   </p>
   <p>
    This awesome (just like Cloak the Gathering) power gives them
  command over ice and snow. Legend tells of elder Dottir using
  whole icebergs as conveyances. This may explain occasional
  evidence of their presence in Antarctica and in temperate areas
  during particularly severe winters. In addition to pushing
  floating mountains of ice (albeit slowly) this power may be used
  to draw ice and snow storms, assuming the weather is suitable,
  and possibly even to direct them. A roll of Manipulation+Occult
  is required for this as with the Thaumaturgy path Weather
  Control. Certain effects such as rain and lightning strikes are
  not possible through this means, which merely affects frozen
  forms of water.
   </p>
   <p>
    Yet another possible use, and by far the most difficult, is
  the movement of small individual pieces of ice, such as throwing
  snowballs -- or 4-foot-long icicles. The attack roll for this is
  based on Occult + Dexterity. The maximum total damage per round
  is as the Dottir's strength. Difficulties and modifiers are as a
  melee weapon of similar form to the object (snowballs are
  difficulty 4 with a -1 damage modifier). The Dottir can
  manipulate one extra object in this manner for every dot over 5.
  Thus a 5th Generation Helsdottir might project 3 snowballs,
  really hard.
   </p>
   <p>
    A popular trick is to open ice cracks under particularly
  obnoxious interlopers. This is also useful for concealing
  oneself, slowly disappearing into the ice in a manner reminiscent
  of the Protean Earth Meld ability.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some of these may seem especially powerful, but it should be
  noted that the majority are totally useless on a warm summer
  night in Chicago.
   </p>
   <p>
    "We tried to catch her, Master, but she pelted us with
  sno-cones!"
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    OOOOOOO - Freeze
   </p>
   <p>
    The Dottir can spend blood points to instantly freeze
  something, @ 1 BP per 60 lbs. of water, roughly a cubic foot (7
  1/2 gallons or 30 liters.) A man-sized creature would require 2
  to 4 blood points to freeze completely, although partial freezing
  tends to be sufficient to disable or kill mortals. To affect
  animate beings, Wits + Occult must be rolled vs. the target's
  Willpower. Success indicates that the target freezes. Kindred may
  counter every blood point spent by the Dottir with two blood
  points spent to thaw out, if they think of it. Frozen Garou will
  remain alive until thawed if they are frozen in a regenerating
  form, but if in Homid form, they will die.
   </p>
   <p>
    The power operates within sight and can be directed with some
  flexibility, to freeze 12 square feet of a pond one inch deep,
  for instance.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    OOOOOOOO - Cloak of Winter
   </p>
   <p>
    The Dottir envelops herself in a cloak of bitter cold. The
  area within 5 feet of her drops to -100 Fahrenheit and an icy
  swirl of wind whips around adding a substantial wind chill
  factor. All freezable substances within this ring almost
  instantly freeze, water vapor and carbon dioxide precipitating
  from the air.
   </p>
   <p>
    In truth, no known Dottir has ever risen above this niveau,
  but here's what they might be:
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    OOOOOOOOO - Glaciation
   </p>
   <p>

    The Blood Mead
   </h2>
   <blockquote>
    "Kvasir is so wise that nobody asks of him a question he is
    unable to answer. He travelled far and wide to teach men wisdom
    and came once to feast with some dwarfs, Fjalar and Galar.
    These called him aside for a word in private and killed him,
    letting his blood run into two crocks and one kettle. The
    kettle was called Odhroerir, but the crocks were known as Son
    and Bodhn. They mixed his blood with honey, and it became the
    mead which makes whomever drinks of it a poet or scholar."

     <em>
      Skaldskaparmal
     </em>
    </br>
   </blockquote>
   Helsdottir brew a unique variety of mead with vitae.
  The ritual involved is moderately complex (2nd level), though any
  Helsdottir with a personal name will almost certainly know it, as
  the brewing is usually performed communally. The mead normally
  has roughly half again the volume of blood used to make it and,
  unlike most vitae, it maintains its potency indefinitely in
  storage, if kept in suitable conditions. Kindred may consume it
  for nourishment without the ill effects usually associated with
  "normal" beverages, although it does have mild intoxicating
  properties which will affect them.
   <p>
    The making of the mead requires casks, kettles, and the like,
  often hidden in subterranean caverns, which tend to remain at the
  appropriate temperature for fermentation, or occasionally in
  camouflaged above-ground structures. Sometimes ice-brewing is
  used, though this involves an extremely long period of
  fermentation. Of course, a good supply of honey must be on hand.
  The fermentation takes three to six weeks, depending on the
  temperature, type of vitae used, and concentration of honey, the
  greater the longer. Human blood is preferred, but if animal vitae
  is used, it is sometimes concentrated during the process to
  reduce its volume. After fermentation, it should be aged at least
  a year for best flavor, although it is drinkable before then. If
  the optional palatability roll is used, the difficulty increases
  by one for every three months less than a full year.
   </p>
   <p>
    The mead is important in a number of rituals and serves as a
  medium for a certain type of rune magic (see below). It also
  allows the Helsdottir to stock up on large quantities of vitae at
  one time so that frequent hunting trips are unnecessary. These
  mass brewings seem often to coincide with disastrous avalanches
  in skiing areas.
   </p>
   <p>
    Interestingly, the normal brewing process seems to eliminate
  the potential of the blood bond when used with Kindred vitae. It
  does however eliminate many of its other peculiar properties as
  well.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Greater Blood Mead:
   </p>
   <p>
    A more advanced ritual can be used to make a special brew that
  temporarily confers some skills and knowledge of the "donor" to
  those who consume the beverage. This 5th level ritual absolutely
  requires the (final) death of the victim and will confer one dot
  in any Ability, Path, or Discipline possessed by said victim at
  greater proficiency than the individual who quaffs a drinking
  horn full of it. The duration of the effect is one day. The
  statistic affected must be chosen during the brewing process, as
  different incantations are required for different types. The
  brewer must roll Occult + Intelligence at standard difficulty and
  the number of successes indicates how many effective doses are
  produced (never more than the number of blood points used.) A
  botch can produce rather disturbing toxic effects.

    With either ritual, an optional Intelligence + Zymurgy roll

   It is said that the god Odin obtained the knowledge
  of the runes by fixing himself to a tree with his spear and
  hanging there for nine days and nine nights. Helsdottir know this
  story well, and they know exactly what journey it is that takes
  nine days and nights. Hel is the goddess of Death, the ultimate
  keeper of secrets, and it was she that revealed the mystery of
  the runes to the All-father Odin, they say. It should be no
  surprise then that Helsdottir are usually well versed in these
  mysteries, in runes as well as the ancient shamanistic forms of
  sorcery known as Seidhr and Utiseta.
   <p>
    They are capable of using Rituals like Thaumaturgists and all
  are taught the Helsdottir Ritual of Embrace (a level 1 ritual).
  This ability is concomitant with the Hel's Will discipline.
   </p>
   <p>
    Helsdottir may learn and use Thaumaturgical paths as well but
  at a higher cost in experience points, namely 6 x level rather
  than the usual 4 (making them quite expensive). This reflects the
  alienness of blood magic. This being said, they do have their own
  Path of Runes which costs the standard 4 x level. Each type of
  rune inscription must be learned individually from a teacher, as
  with a ritual, and each has a level based on its power and
  difficulty.
   </p>
   <p>
    Of course, a Dottir who manages to acquire the Thaumaturgy
  discipline somehow would naturally acquire Paths normally. It is
  perhaps possible that a Thaumaturgist could learn the Path of
  Runes, but it must be a very rare occasion. Non-Dottir would
  certainly not be as adept in the use of necromantic runes.
   </p>
   <p>
    Rune magic involves several steps:
   </p>
   <p>
    1) The carving of the rune/s. They may be carved into a number
  of materials, typically with a knife.
   </p>
   <p>
    2) The coloring of the rune/s. This is to rub the runes with a
  coloring agent, vitae in the case of Helsdottir magic, whether
  the casters or someone else's.
   </p>
   <p>
    3) The incantation. This may be quite simple or it might
  involve a rather extended litany. In general it will be different
  from the actual text of the inscription.
   </p>
   <p>
    4) Ancillary rites. Rune carving often (though not always)
  involves some other action to be performed at this point. Walking
  backwards around the object counter-clockwise is one example. In
  cases where the magic affects a particular individual, such as a
  curse (known as a "nidh"), the object must usually be placed in
  proximity to the affected individual. There is also a procedure
  by which the runes are now scraped off of the object, typically
  wood, and the scrapings are mixed into mead to transfer the spell
  through consumption of the liquid. Helsdottir brew a special
  variety of mead from vitae, which they can use for this
  purpose.
   </p>
   <p>
    5) Nullifying rune magic. The spell may be broken by scraping
  off the runes, as if to be used in a potion, but the scrapings
  must then be burnt in a fire. Runes are often inscribed in less
  obvious places for this reason, as well as out of the general
  inclination toward secrecy.
   </p>
   <p>
    Inscription of a magical rune (or set of them) costs as many
  blood points as its level for the coloring, as the runes almost
  seem to thirstily drink the vitae. The actual text of the
  inscription may be a single rune, though sets of two or three are
  more common. Stronger magic may involve lengthy inscriptions
  involving various words of power such as "leek" (laukr) or "ale"
  (alu) (really!). The most powerful inscriptions always include a
  formula identifying the runemistress. Frequently the caster
  identifies herself with an occult pseudonym. She will always use
  this name with a particular spell, choosing it to be appropriate
  to the particular magic. E.g. "I, Defender-of-Stones carved these
  runes." for a spell defending a sacred stone circle. Those with
  Occult skill may be able to glean information as to the identity
  of the carver from these, although the difficulty for this tends
  to be fairly high.
   </p>
   <p>
    Using the Path of Runes requires the standard Willpower test
  and the inscription requires a test of Occult+Dexterity. After
  all, the unseen powers won't know what to do with it if they
  can't read your chicken scratching. The difficulty of this roll
  depends on the size, texture, and composition of the medium.
  E.g.:
   </p>
   <pre>
    <b>
     Medium              Difficulty to carve
    </b>
    Flat gold, lead surface   5
Smooth pine board         6
Large Bone (thigh)        6
Small bone (big knuckle)  7
Headstone                 7
Thorn                     8
Natural Granite Rockface  8
Pebble                    9
   </pre>
   Failure will often be apparent, although a botch may be a
subtle error which is not noticed until the magical properties are
called upon. This roll also includes the possibility of
misspellings and assorted "typos".
   <p>
    In general, one area in which the Dottir do not freely share
  information with one another is the knowledge of runes. Magical
  rune knowledge is jealously guarded, and such knowledge is
  something of a status symbol among them. Note that it is not
  possible to learn the magical use of a rune formula from just
  seeing it. The proper manner of inscription and incantation must
  be known to empower the runes. Complete rune rituals are seldom
  written down and must be learned from an informant, although it
  is not at all unusual to obtain such information via necromancy
  or from dealings spirits and creatures such as frost giants or
  dwarfs. As difficult as that sounds, it is usually much easier
  than prying the secrets from the cold, undead lips of other
  Dottir.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Length of efficacy:
    </b>
    Rune magic as performed by the
  Dottir tends to be strongly linked to the moon. Three-fold
  carvings, all simple 1st and 2nd level formulas last until the
  next full moon, as do most other types, unless otherwise
  specified. Runes consumed in a blood mead preparation are
  effective on the imbiber for the duration of the scene and retain
  their potency in the mixture until the full moon. Helsdottir do
  not lightly reveal this lunar time limit to outsiders.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     1 - Tyr Rune:
    </b>
    This is a common and well-known rune use,
  found frequently on the weapons of the ancient Germanic peoples.
  The rune is inscribed threefold and has the effect of improving
  the damage done by a melee weapon by one die. It can only add one
  die to a given weapon -- thus it is not possible to cover a
  dagger with tyr runes such that it becomes as lethal as a
  poison-coated flaming chainsaw. The required incantation is
  simply to invoke the name of Tyr twice. The effects will last
  until the next full moon. The weapon delivers one aggravated
  wound to supernatural creatures on a successful hit, but no more
  than one. It can only be cast successfully on Tuesday, the day
  sacred to Tyr.
   </p>
   <pre>
    /|\     Also represents the sound 'T'.  The name simply means "a god"
  |      although it can also specifically refer to the battle god
  |      Tyr (or Tiu - OE)
   </pre>
   <b>
    1 - Feh (wealth) Rune:
   </b>
   Another common one. Like the
Tyr rune, it's repeated three-fold. The effect is of general
beneficence. In game terms, it tends to produce minor serendipitous
effects such as finding a $5 bill on the street and averts minor
mishaps. The individual to receive the beneficence must carry the
inscribed object.
   <pre>
    |/
  |/   Feh
  |
   </pre>
   <b>
    2 - Thurs (Giant) Rune (also Thorn in OE):
   </b>
   Analogous
to the Feh rune, this rune carved three-fold curses an individual.
It tends to produce minor mishaps such as losing a $5 bill on the
street or tripping in a gopher hole. The target must either somehow
be induced to carry the inscribed object, or his name must be used
in the inscription (hence it's 2nd level status.)

   <b>
    2 - Haegl (Hail) Rune:
   </b>
   This rune carved three-fold
attracts hailstorms and foul weather. It is often used as a
component in more complex curse formulas.
   <p>
    <b>
     2 - Is (Ice) Rune:
    </b>
    This rune carved three-fold can
  reduce the ambient temperature in an area by around 20 degrees
  Fahrenheit. It is effective for an area the size of a small room.
  Multiple carvings have cumulative effects. Like other three-fold
  runes, its effects last until the next full moon.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     2 - Sleep Runes:
    </b>
    This is a short inscription which is
  carved onto a thorn. Upon sticking someone with this thorn, the
  rune carver's Occult + Path of Runes is rolled at a difficulty of
  the targets Willpower. Upon success, the target will fall asleep
  in a number of turns equal to his Stamina minus the number of
  successes. Botches usually result in the user pricking
  herself.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     2 - Runes of Draugr Binding:
    </b>
    These runes are capable of
  preventing the dead from wandering. In the old days, its main
  purpose was to prevent reanimated corpses known as draugar (q.v.)
  from leaving their tombs, but a more general use of restraining
  Wraiths and other varieties of restless dead is now much more
  common. Kindred are somewhat subject to this, but may make a
  Willpower roll once per day at standard difficulty versus the
  Occult + Intelligence of the caster. A simple success will break
  the binding. Runes of draugr binding are permanent until removed
  or overcome in the case of creatures that are capable of it. In
  the area of necromantic runes, Helsdottir inscriptions are quite
  powerful.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     2 - Runes of Fertility:
    </b>
    Among mortal runemasters such
  runes were quite common, as were the usual blessings, and curses.
  Dottir can use them as well, although they rarely have the
  motivation to do so. It is rumored however that certain higher
  level versions (perhaps 4th or 5th) of this are capable of making
  even Kindred or Garou Metis fertile for short periods of
  time.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Higher level runes:
    </b>
    Many of these tend to be extended
  versions of the lower level runes. Various forms of blessings and
  curses are common, although any formula over 2nd level tends to
  be especially secret. As always, feel free to invent your own.
  These more powerful inscriptions tend to be rather
  individualistic anyway.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     3 - Runes of Toughness:
    </b>
    These runes carved on an object
  make it essentially unbreakable. The runes may also be consumed
  in blood mead as described above to produce a temporary one dot
  increase in Stamina (lasts one scene). Effects are not
  cumulative.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     3 - Runes of Speech:
    </b>
    When inscribed on a piece of bark
  which is placed under the tongue of a corpse, these runes enable
  the corpse to speak and answer questions. If the corpse died a
  non-violent death (and not at sea, incidentally) it is obligated
  to answer
    <em>
     any
    </em>
    question posed by a Helsdottir truthfully.
  Other types of dead have volition in this matter. The corpse must
  not be too decomposed, at least having a tongue, and will remain
  talkative until the next full moon or the bark is removed. It is
  advisable to take care with a fresh corpse, as the vitae the
  Dottir uses to color the runes might have certain side
  effects...
   </p>
   <p>
    Vampires, garou, and other supernatural creatures which can
  speak are subject to this, although it is rare that they die
  non-violent deaths.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     3 - Runes of Restlessness:
    </b>
    These runes when carved
  somewhere around a gravesite causes its occupant to become some
  form of restless dead, typically a Draugr or Wraith.
  Unfortunately, it's hard to tell which is going to happen (ST's
  discretion). The victim is under no constraint to obey the caster
  and more often than not doesn't even realize what happened. This
  is typically used as a curse. With Wraiths, the runes act as a
  fetter. These runes remain effectual until they are
  destroyed.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     4 - Runes of the Shambling Servant (Ganglati):
    </b>
    The
  caster carves the runes on a bone of a dead person or animal and
  with a ghastly invocation of dread chthonic powers creates a sort
  of walking dead with the same physical form as the bone's owner.
  This "shambling servant" or Ganglati (see the mythical
  description of Hel's abode) retains shreds of the knowledge and
  memories of the deceased, but is not really intelligent and can
  only follow the verbal instructions of the caster, whom it will
  obey. It or parts of it will remain animated until the original
  bone (which is incorporated into the regenerated body) is broken
  or destroyed, at which time it disintegrates. They ignore wound
  penalties as do Draugar, although after they reach 0 Health
  levels, they are little more than piles of flailing parts. These
  golem-like monstrosities do not regenerate like Draugar. The
  animating runes remain effective until the next full moon, at
  which time the Ganglati falls to dust.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     4 - Runes of Hearkening:
    </b>
    By carving the name of an
  individual with this formula, the caster causes a powerful
  summons of the named creature. Unlike with the Presence
  discipline, the summonee is not bound to come or particularly
  enthralled, but will feel a constant nagging sensation that will
  cause a one die penalty on all actions after a week. There is no
  restriction of distance. The subject will start to have dreams
  and short visions of the location where the runes are. They are
  dispelled as soon as the subject looks upon them. The duration is
  indefinite and one caster can only have one set of runes in
  effect for a particular person, but several casters can join
  forces to make life rather unpleasant. If the subject chooses to
  heed the summons, he will have no problem finding the way,
  finding that he has an instinctive sense for it.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     4 - Runes of Refusal:
    </b>
    These runes carved on an object
  may be displayed to ward off Draugar, Wraiths, vampires, and
  various forms of restless dead as if by True Faith. The effective
  Faith rating corresponds to the caster's rating in the Path of
  Runes + Charisma if the caster is present or simply the Path
  rating if not. They are effective until the next full moon.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     5 - Runes of Vengeance:
    </b>
    These runes are carved and then
  mixed with blood mead, which is then poured over some mortal
  remains (anything will do) of a murder victim. the victim will
  then recorporate, becoming a vengeance-Draugr, an Aptrgongumadhr,
  bent on the destruction of its killer/s, and it will seek said
  individuals out until they or it are destroyed. They have the
  physical characteristics of normal Draugar (5 dots) and the
  social and mental attributes and abilities they had at the time
  of death and will use them considerably more often than normal
  Draugar. They can be quite violent and single-minded, whatever
  their former dispositions, but they do show some calculation in
  their actions. For every wound inflicted on a target of revenge,
  such Draugar gain one health level, even going over the maximum,
  as they are supernaturally energized by vengeance.
   </p>
   <p>
    Vengeance-Draugar may be destroyed in the same manner as
  normal Draugar (q.v.), by fire or decapitation, are immobilized
  by staking, and have the same curious habit of regenerating at
  dusk at their gravesites. Once successful, the creature crumbles
  to dust. They are often created using greater blood mead (from
  the 5th level ritual) to enhance their abilities.
   </p>
   <p>
    The creator has no direct control over this creature, though
  it won't bother her unless she gets in its way or is one of the
  killers, naturally.

   <p>
    <b>
     5 - Greater Runes of Speech:
    </b>
    Similar to the level 3
  runes of speech, these permit the same sort of access to the dead
  but do not require a corpse, only the name of the deceased. The
  runes are carven on a horse skull which speaks to the caster.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     5 - Greater Runes of Fertility:
    </b>
    These are said to tap
  the very essence of the vital spirit of the Earth, perhaps Gaia,
  and can bestow procreative power on almost anything, including
  Garou metis and all manner of undead. The runes are mixed in
  blood mead but have only a short duration of potency, a few hours
  at most, so the imbiber had better hurry about it. They always
  produce results... of some sort.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Runes of Protection:
    </b>
    This is a special class of rune
  formulas that confer protection from malevolent Rituals of
  Tremere, Garou, or others.
   </p>
   <p>
    They tend to be lengthier inscriptions and do not have a set
  text, although there are rules and formulas governing them which
  must be learned as with specific rune formula types. In order to
  create effective runes of protection, the caster must be familiar
  with the ritual to be warded against. Occult + Wits must be
  rolled to determine the proper runes to outmaneuver the magic of
  the offending Ritual. The difficulty for this roll depends on the
  level of familiarity with the Ritual:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Created the Ritual: 4
    </li>
    <li>
     Performed the Ritual: 6
    </li>
    <li>
     Seen the Ritual Performed: 8
    </li>
    <li>
     Heard of the Ritual: 9
    </li>
   </ul>
   For instance, if a friend says "I've heard they know a spell
  that can stake you from a distance," a runemistress of sufficient
  power can attempt to counter it, but the chances of success are
  slim, with a 9 difficulty. A botch in this instance would
  certainly have most distressing results.
   <p>
    The number of successes determines how many times the runes
  will counter the Ritual before they lose their power.
   </p>
   <p>
    Once an opposing formula for a particular Ritual has been
  developed, it can naturally be used again for the same Ritual. Of
  course, there's no way to know if it works until it's been
  tested...
   </p>
   <p>
    The level for a Runes of Protection formula is equal to the
  level of the Ritual which is being countered. Any attempt by a
  caster of lower level than this to use the appropriate runes of
  protection will obviously fail.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Seidhr and Utiseta Rituals:
   </h2>
   Seidhr and Utiseta are
  essentially ritual frameworks. Seidhr rites are performed on a
  high platform (a seidhhjallr) while utiseta is always performed
  in remote areas at special site such as a crossroads, a grave
  mound, or a prominence. Utiseta literally means "sitting out".
  Objects frequently used are tall poles, ceremonial spears, and
  certain plants such as the flax, the leek, and the samphire (or
  whatever you think "salu" really is). Horses and parts thereof
  are commonly used in these rituals. Also important is a type of
  flat metal amulet known as a bracteate, which will typically bear
  a cultic scene with some runes on one side.
   <p class="c1">
    Rituals of Transition:
   </p>
   <p>
    Several forms of this ritual exist; all are difficult. They
  allow the caster and some companions to travel into the Umbra and
  the realms of Hel's paradigm, through the Midgard domain.
   </p>
   <p>
    The first form requires two horses for every traveller. Each
  pair of horses must be slain simultaneously with the same spear
  while a rider sits upon one. Their spirits are magically combined
  in the umbra through the ritual to form an eight-legged spirit
  horse. Upon their deaths the rider is drawn with them into the
  umbra and can travel upon its back.
   </p>
   <p>
    The second form requires a boat or ship of some sort.
  Helsdottir tend to have a sentimental preference for Viking
  longships, but any vessel will do. During the ritual, the ship is
  launched and everyone who is to go along boards it. The ship,
  which is piled with flammable materials, is then set afire. As it
  burns it becomes umbral as do its occupants, who are not harmed
  by the fire, if the ritual is done correctly. Obviously if things
  don't go exactly right, this can turn into a rather bad
  situation. Roetschreck is also something of a problem when this
  is done with Kindred -- sometimes the less courageous must be
  lashed to the mast. It is however sometimes much more convenient
  for a large group than sacrificing a small herd of horses, two by
  two. The looks of umbral garou as a longship full of half-corpse
  women glides by through the umbra is said to be almost worth the
  trouble.
   </p>
   <p>
    The third form is much simpler to execute but tends to leave
  its subjects rather vulnerable. Each traveller must be impaled on
  an ash tree with a ceremonial spear and left hanging. His/her
  spirit is separated and sent to the umbra for exactly nine
  nights, during which the body is helpless in the physical world,
  similarly to the Auspex Astral Travel ability. The traveller
  cannot be recalled earlier and this must be performed in a remote
  open area as it is an utiseta rite. During this period, the body
  does not die or degenerate from the spear wound (if a mortal),
  although upon return the traveller will be in dire need of
  medical attention without some sort of regenerative ability. If
  the body is removed from the tree prematurely, the spirit is
  trapped in the umbra and the normal effects of having been
  impaled by a spear (often death) commence.
   </p>
   <p>
    To summarize, none of these Rituals of Transition are
  particularly easy. Some work has been done to create a ritual in
  which an automobile is used, by driving it off a cliff for
  instance, but these efforts have not been successful to date.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Skills
   </h2>
   Helsdottir almost always have Survival and Occult,
  with specializations in runology or seidhr magic. Lupine or
  Spirit Lore is not uncommon as well. In general, they tend to be
  well-versed in occult mysteries and practices. Also common is the
  brewing skill, Zymurgy.
   <h2>
    Things That Go Bump In The Northern Night
   </h2>
   <b>
    Draugr (pl.
  Draugar)
   </b>
   <p>
    This is a sort of Nordic vampire/zombie. Draugar are
  essentially reanimated corpses which guard their burial places,
  sometimes catching and devouring mortals who happen by, sometimes
  even extending the range of their depredations (a wandering
  Draugr was known as an "aptrgongumadhr," but I won't bother much
  with the term for obvious reasons.) They are similar to vampires
  in that they must be destroyed by decapitation or fire, and may
  be at least be stopped by driving a stake through the heart.
  However, they cannot embrace new Draugar and have no particular
  need of human blood to survive; they just seem to like it. They
  have straight fives for their physical traits. Draugar usually
  have the mental and social attributes they had in life, but these
  are deeply submerged by its bestial nature and mostly unused. In
  most circumstances, Draugar are not functionally very intelligent
  and should essentially be considered to be in a perpetual state
  of frenzy. It has been speculated that this is evidence that they
  are animated purely by the vampiric Beast without the benefit of
  a counterbalancing influence. They occasionally do display
  elements of their former personalities and knowledge, but these
  are usually rather warped displays.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Draugr is not harmed by sunlight, though it shuns the
  light of day as a rule. If in its burial place, it regenerates
  all damage every night at dusk, until it is cremated,
  decapitated, or staked.
   </p>
   <p>
    The occurrence of Draugar is extremely rare in this day and
  age. They only come into being in areas where the gauntlet is
  particularly low, especially near caerns and nodes. What it is
  exactly that foments the change from dead body to ambulatory dead
  body is unknown. Some have opined that the Draugar are sort of a
  "wild vampire".
   </p>
   <p>
    Helsdottir can enter the nine worlds of Hel's paradigm
  (including Hel's own, Niflheim) through certain Rituals of
  Transition. They most often do this to obtain occult secrets and
  conduct nefarious dealings with the inhabitants of these realms.
  The umbral domain of these realms is known as Midgard and to
  reach any of them requires first travelling to Midgard through
  the near Umbra. Midgard (and the realms of icy Jotunheim and
  fiery Muspellheim) was once practically joined to the WoD realm,
  but the raising of the gauntlet has cut it off almost completely.
  Some of the more common creatures of these realms:
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Aesir &amp; Vanir:
    </b>
    The old gods, the Aesir and Vanir,
  are said to be weak and decrepit in these times. They are
  sometimes encountered in their home worlds (Asgardh and Vanaheim)
  but are still much superior to mere mortals and most vampires in
  their power. They are rather hostile to Helsdottir, Get of
  Fenris, and Wyrm-creatures of any sort. Among them are Odin,
  Frigg, Frey, Thor, and Loki (who is a bit tied up at the moment).
  The gods have many powers and are often capable of shapeshifting
  or changing their appearance.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Frost Giants (Jotun):
    </b>
    These creatures, typically 8 to
  10 feet in height, are no longer found in this realm, although
  from time to time one has been known to enter it for a short time
  from its native world Jotunheim. Frost giants are often quite
  intelligent and many are gifted sorcerers. Shapeshifting is a
  very common ability. Their character creation is as with humans
  only they get an automatic two dot bonus in Strength and an extra
  health level.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Dwarfs:
    </b>
    These are similar to the traditional RPG dwarf
  (being the inspiration for them). They have their own realm like
  the frost giants, where they hoard wealth and constantly plot and
  conspire to steal others' treasures through clever and deceitful
  means. They know many secrets which are to be had for a
  price.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Playing The Dottir
   </h2>
   With supplemental character types such
  as the Dottir, there is always a question as to whether they
  should merely be non-player characters or actually playable. I
  myself, who once invented a sentient photo-synthetic organism
  with a silicate/silane-based biochemistry for a character, have
  long believed that such characters can be a positive thing in an
  RPG. Some will strongly disagree, and I can see reasons why they
  would. Those individuals can just use Helsdottir as NPCs, if they
  want to use them at all. I'm sure people will ask "Are these
  intended as PCs?" Well, yes, if you want to use them that way. It
  may not be as smooth as established character types, but I tried
  to provide a power balance, and I think I've succeeded. Looking
  like some B-movie monster severely limits one's interactions with
  normals and many of the discipline powers are quite useless in
  warm weather. These two features should offset the power and
  flexibility to the point where Helsdottir characters are not
  overly powerful compared to PCs of other types at the same
  experience level. In addition, much of the Ritual magic is
  provided with limitations, most of which were quite natural. The
  Rituals of Transition are a good example of this. The runes could
  be a little much, but I should stress that it ought to be very
  hard to find the formulas; two separate rolls are always
  required, they require blood points (though not necessarily the
  caster's), and the Path costs experience to learn.
   <p>
    Although this is intended to go with White Wolf's
    <em>
     Vampire:
  the Masquerade
    </em>
    , it refers often to
    <em>
     Werewolf: the
  Apocalypse
    </em>
    and mentions a few things from supplements. Much
  will be unintelligible without knowledge of Werewolf, but the
  other references are incidental and intended for the masses of
  people who do know them and are sure to ask things like "Doesn't
  Helsdottir necromancy infringe on Giovanni territory?"
   </p>
   <p>
    If the Dottir are to be an integral part of a Chronicle, I
  would recommend some reading on the mythological and cultural
  background.
   </p>
   <p>
    I just had an urge to make up some background that captured
  the look and feel of Norse mythological world, which in many ways
  was easily as grim as the World of Darkness; a world that was
  inhabited by malevolent beasts and wicked giants who fought gods
  that weren't really much better. A world that would ultimately
  die in an uninterrupted four-year winter followed by an
  all-consuming fire, an all-covering flood, and finally a great
  internecine battle over the charred, drowned earth in which the
  gods themselves would perish at the hands of the mustered forces
  of darkness, who would sail upon them in a ship built from the
  fingernails of corpses. That's darkness.
   </p>
   <p>
    Anyway, I tried to build some hooks in too. There's the
  Hospitality ability (Hel's Will 3) so a Helsdottir can provide a
  good enabler for arctic activity -- for a price of course. The
  sorcery aspect is always a good one too. Who doesn't need a
  little magical assistance now and again, especially assistance
  that can propel one into the Umbra or possibly even temporarily
  restore the ability to procreate in the human manner?
   </p>
   <h2>
    The Secret of Hel
   </h2>
   What practically no one knows is that
  Hel is not an Antediluvian, nor a Methuselah, nor even an Elder.
  She is simply not a Cainite at all. Neither are the Helsdottir,
  exactly. Hel was the first among the Incarna and Celestines of
  the Germanic pantheon to recognize the inevitability of the
  Christian threat to their base of worshippers. She knew the
  Kindred well, being the mistress of the northern underworld and
  used her considerable mystic connections in her old and by that
  time mostly neglected aspect as the tripartite Greek moon goddess
  Selene/Artemis/Hecate. It was most likely her experience with the
  decline of Classical Greek paganism which convinced her of the
  necessity to act to preserve her power while she still had it. As
  Hecate, the goddess of the black art, she also knew rumors which
  foreshadowed the coming of the static reality.
   <p>
    Hel discovered some of the secrets of Caine, notably the
  fragment of his avatar which burns in every Cainite. She learned
  how to replace it and substitute a fragment of her own divine
  being with a sort of spirit virus. After several dramatically
  unsuccessful experiments in the days following the fall of the
  Roman empire, she captured a powerful Gangrel of the fifth
  generation -- taking a more powerful one might attract undue
  attention. She warped the hapless creature into her own image to
  reinforce the magical signature-bond (the Doctrine of Signatures)
  so that it could accept her avatar and infected it. Amazingly it
  worked, for the most part. Disappointingly, the new creation had
  a few problems procreating. The Hel-avatar simply wasn't
  completely compatible with the Caine-avatar or else some of the
  mystical restraints on the Beast were compromised in the process.
  Whatever the case, it was clear that every neonate would require
  personal attention to stabilize the Embrace, hence the Ritual.
  The strong resemblance of the Dottir to Hel herself is necessary
  to prop up this arrangement, the price of "hacking into" Caine's
  thaumaturgical artifice for her own purposes. All along she has
  expected to find an angry Caine knocking on the door of
  Damp-With-Sleet, but he has yet to appear. And she still watches,
  intently, keeping her brood ever vigilant for him.
   </p>
   <p>
    But the project succeeded in its main objective -- to provide
  Hel a power base when her less foresighted peers had shrivelled
  up and blown away with the winds of change. The Gods were mighty,
  but the children of Loki and Angrbodha were the ones left
  standing after all was said and done.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Author's Notes: Read First, Flame Later
   </h2>
   The term
  "Helsdottir" is really an Anglo-Norse hybrid of my own creation.
  The actual Old Norse might be "Heljar dottir" (plural "Heljar
  doetr") or Heldottir (and "Heldoetr") depending on whether the
  genitive phrase or an actual compound is preferred.
   <p>
    I have represented the "eth" character as "dh." In many
  English translations this is appears as a "d." The pronunciation
  is a voiced dental fricative, as the first consonant in "they."
  Certain words such as "Odin" and "Midgard" appear commonly enough
  that I decided to use the conventional English spelling.
   </p>
   <p>
    The vowel combination "oe" represents the "o-umlaut", a
  rounded vowel which does not exist in English. (The same vowel
  appears in the names of Icelandic pop singer Bjoerk and the
  German poet Goethe.)
   </p>
   <p>
    The adaptation from the "Gylfaginning" ("the Deluding of
  Gylfi," part of Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda) contains a few
  omissions and licenses for dramatic purposes. The essence follows
  the original. View it as an alternate version of the story
  preserved in Dottir tradition.
   </p>
   <p>
    I use a number of allusions to Norse myth, particularly the
  myth of Baldr's death, which is one of the most important
  concerning Hel.
   </p>
   <p>
    The section on rune magic attempts to incorporate as much of
  the actual pre-Christian magical practices of the ancient
  Germanic tribes as I could find. There are a few other details I
  didn't bother searching out and including, such as the
  restriction to 24 types of things on which runes can be carved
  from one particular source. I think it's plenty detailed as it
  is. My primary reference for this area was
    <em>
     Runes and
  Magic
    </em>
    [1]. It's not a light read, but it's pretty solid.
   </p>
   <p>
    My vision of Hel as a goddess of sorcery as well as death is
  slightly extrapolated. The strong personification of Hel as seen
  in the Prose Edda may be of relatively late origin, perhaps ca.
  the 10th century, although the concept of the relation between
  the death and magic is clearly quite old. In Old English we see
  the word "helruna" ("hel" + "rune") for "sorceress" or
  "necromancer" and a similar cognate existed in Gothic.
   </p>
   <p>
    The section on mead brewing was drawn from a little research
  and a little personal experience. Don't have conniptions if the
  details aren't exactly right; it's only color, and, besides, the
  actual details vary enormously from one recipe to the next. I
  actually have a theory that blood was used as a yeast nutrient at
  one time, as reflected in the Kvasir myth. Honey is very
  nitrogen-poor.
   </p>
   <p>
    Draugar are an authentic and fairly important part of Norse
  legend. Most of the details about their characteristic and
  behavior are found in at least some original sources.
   </p>
   <p>
    The exact relationship among Fenris, Joermungand (the Wyrm),
  and Hel in the WoD is left vague purposefully. I didn't want to
  make too many aspects dependent on a particular interpretation,
  though I do feel that some relationship is necessary for
  Helsdottir to work. For instance, I have indicated their
  particular interest in the Get of Fenris and the peculiar
  reaction to them by the Get. One possible way to view it is as a
  response to the intrusion of a different reality paradigm into
  theirs.
   </p>
   <p>
    I also tried to avoid too many references to the Aesir and
  certain details of cosmology such as the "nine worlds" and the
  relations of the various -Gards and -Heims, partly because these
  vary greatly from source to source and partly because I wanted to
  leave room for people who might want to do other stuff with
  it.
