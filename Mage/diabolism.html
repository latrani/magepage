   True Diabolists: The Revised Rules
  </h1>
  <h2>
   By Chris Mangum
  </h2>
  Like many, I picked up the Book of
  Madness and said "cool!" And, also like others, I was
  disappointed by some sections; in my case, the section on
  Diabolism was the biggest problem. The line about "worst
  stereotypes of the gaming community" just broke the last straw: I
  got a sub- par product 'cause WW is afraid of the Religious
  Right! What a crock! It gave
  <b>
   no
  </b>
  ideas for tempting and
  corrupting player Mages, even warned against it. Plus, there
  seemed to be no build-it reason for becoming a diabolist in the
  first place. According to the rules given, a Mage didn't get
  anything out of it anyway, so why sell your soul for a
  familiar???
  <p>
   So, like many others in the past, I'm putting my money where
  my mouth is. What follows are revised rules for the Infernalist
  in your chronicle, including extensive notes on what a diabolist
  gets out of his pacts, as well as some brief philosophy on three
  general types on Infernal mages. Some may find what follows a bit
  rules-ish, but this happens to be my style for dealing with this.
  If it weren't, my "organizational" skills would have completely
  ruined it's usefulness for me. Anyway, I thought
   <i>
    BoMadness
   </i>
   had plenty of philosophy to go around.
  </p>
  <p>
   Please note that these changes were
   <b>
    heavily
   </b>
   suggested
  by the work done in
   <i>
    The Maleficium
   </i>
   , the guide to the
  infernal for Ars Magica. No copyright infringement is intended,
  and all trademarks belong to their rightful owners. This is
  strictly created as a suppliment for play, and not as a means to
  profit. So don't sue me, WWGS and WotC :).
  </p>
  <p>
   You can also distrubute this any way you like, as long as you
  don't make any profit off it...if you wanna print it out as sell
  it at cost to your friends, feel free...WWGS and WotC may sue
  you, but I won't. If you
   <b>
    do
   </b>
   make profits, though, send
  some my way:)
  </p>
  <p>
   And now, on with the show...
  </p>
  <h1>
   Section I: New Rules
  </h1>
  Infernalists don't seem to get much
  out of their ties to Hell, esp. power-wise. So, to fix this, I
  introduce the following:
  <h2>
   Hierarchy
  </h2>
  Hierarchy acts as a sort of Infernal Arete
  score. Not a true measurement of enlightenment, but a gauge of
  the mage's link to Hell. Hierarchy functions thus: When Hierarchy
  is greater than Arete, the mage may use their Hierarchy score
  instead of Arete for casting spells. They may even use Hierarchy
  when casting Vulgar magick! But, there is a catch. In order to
  gain this advantage, the mage must invoke the infernal powers
  when casting the spell. Thus, the mage may always gain this
  advantage when summoning, binding, or dismissing demons.
  <p>
   Why would a mage want to use Hierarchy? Two reasons: it allows
  for higher rolls when using vulgar magick (of course, with a
  corresponding high chance of rolling a botch, and thus gaining
  mucho paradox), and Hierarchy is easier to gain that Arete. No
  seeking, no epiphany are necessary. Just a continual exposure to
  the Infernal.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Drawbacks:
  </h3>
  First of all, since Hierarchy does not measure
  enlightenment, a mage who gives up the path of evil will find
  that they have spent years, possibly even decades, neglecting the
  search for Ascension. Many mages, realizing this fact, return
  disheartened to the infernal. At least that way they have some
  power.
  <p>
   Secondly, there is the addictive quality of Hierarchy.
  Whenever the mage with Hierarchy is exposed to an infernal text,
  or otherwise reminded of the lures of Hell, and the player wishes
  the character to avoid said knowledge, they must make an extended
  Willpower roll versus a difficulty equal to the mage's Hierarchy
  score + 3 (Max. 10), and must gain a number of successes equal to
  the Hierarchy score. Failure means they jump right in. Thus, as
  the mage falls deeper under the influence of the powers of hell,
  she finds it harder and harder to escape.
  </p>
  <p>
   The third, and most subtle, effect: Paradigm engineering
  (thanks to whoever initially suggested this...I've misplaced his
  name). As the mage continues to use Hierarchy, the infernal
  paradigm begins to subtly infect his surroundings. Neighborhoods
  get meaner, pollution gets worse, etc. This is a prime example of
  resonance in play, and, besides gaining prestige in the Infernal
  hierarchy, is the prime reason demons corrupt mortals: to create
  hell on earth.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Gaining Hierarchy:
  </h3>
  In using the Infernal, the mages gains
  infernal points. These points function much like study points,
  but with two differences: a mage can spend up to 3/4 of the
  experience cost in infernal points, and infernal points can
  <b>
   only
  </b>
  be used for increasing Hierarchy. To raise Hierarchy,
  the mage must spend current rating x 8. The initial level of
  Hierarchy costs 8 xp (Some or all of this cost can be provided in
  the initial pact of an Infernalist.) I'd suggest that Infernal
  points can be gained for the following acts (point values
  suggested only):
  <pre>
   Action                          Infernal points gained
        ------                          ----------------------

        Reading of Infernal Texts       As study points (see M:tA)
        Interaction with Demons:
                Summoning and           Magnitude of Demon*
                  Binding                       
                Learning True           Magnitudex2
                  Name
                Learning Summoning      Magnitude/2
                  Rote
        Discovering Infernal Node       Quintessence output / 4
        Creating an Infernal Node       Quintessence output / 2
        Creating an Infernal Horizon    Storyteller's discretion 
                Realm                   (ie. tons...)
        Creation of an Infernal         Rank of Talisman x 2
                Talisman
        Learning an infernal Sphere     Rating x 2

                                        *=Power / 5
  </pre>
  <p>
   The storyteller, of course, can add to this list as he sees
  fit. Anders suggested granting infernal points for evil acts,
  especially those done either as part of a pact, or for an
  infernal master, and I think this is a great idea. Point values
  for this would definitely have to be on a case-by-case basis.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Other Uses for Hierarchy:
  </h3>
  Hierarchy can also be used as a
  sense of demonic lore and, as its name suggests, a diabolist's
  place in Hell's regime. Hierarchy may also be used in talisman
  construction and the creation of Horizon Realms. Talismans
  created thus will always be subtly cursed in some way, and
  Horizon Realms will be warped in disturbing and dangerous ways.
  <p>
   Hierarchy, like Arete, can also be a measure of the maximum
  sphere ratings a Mage can possess. However, any sphere knowledge
  gained
   <i>
    over
   </i>
   Arete are termed infernal spheres, and can
   <i>
    only
   </i>
   be used with Hierarchy. If a mage gives up his
  infernal ties, he must also relearn these spheres. Cost for
  Infernal spheres is normal. Please note, this applies even if the
  mage raises his Arete for some reason while using Hierarchy. For
  example: a mage has Arete 3, Hierarchy 4, and Forces 3. If the
  mage studies to raise his rating in Forces to 4, this level is an
  Infernal sphere, and this must be noted. Now, even if the mage
  raises his Arete to 4, the 4th level of Forces is
   <i>
    still
   </i>
   Infernal, and can only be used with Hierarchy-based Infernal
  magicks. If the mage now wants a normal rating of Forces 4, he
  must spend the experience needed again, as if he were still only
  Forces 3.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Notes:
  </h3>
  Yes, the above rules can make True Diabolists
  almost obscenely powerful. But there are ways the Storyteller can
  control this. All the below suggestions are to be picked
  carefully, based on the tone and usual power level of the ST's
  chronicle. Since Hierarchy is Infernal power channeled through
  the mage, it's possible, if he angers his Master, for that power
  to be temporarily cut off. You may also want to increase paradox
  gain for infernal botches, or slip in small inconveniences and
  curse-like effects when using Hierarchy. No good can come from
  this power in the end, and the storyteller should reflect this.
  An example: a diabolist is injured in a fight with some
  Chorusers. He uses Hierarchy and Life to heal himself quickly.
  Perhaps the scars form in demonic sigils, or the flesh that
  regenerates is monstrous in some way. Just get creative.
  <p>
   Another note: Though only briefly mentioned, please re-read
  the Storyteller's notes section in the Infernal section of the
  Book of Madness. This is the only place is really lists what an
  Infernalist can get out of these pacts he signs. To restate, they
  include: Knowledges and Skills, study points for Spheres (my
  interpretation...I doubt a demon could just grant a level of a
  Sphere), Investments (per BoM), expansion of certain backgrounds,
  gaining a demonic familiar, and certain Merits (storyteller's
  discretion.) There's another possibility not really mentioned:
  service. The Infernalist may require the summoned being to
  perform some service. Examples include the location and return of
  Magickal texts or talismans, the slaying of an individual, or to
  remain "on call" for a call for help when needed. I'm sure you
  can think of a million others.
  </p>
  <h1>
   Infernal Philosophies
  </h1>
  The other serious lack in the Book
  of Madness. Three examples of the reasons why Diabolists become
  and remain tied to hell are below. Hope they spark some more
  ideas. I'd love to see 'em.
  <h2>
   Resignation
  </h2>
  <blockquote class="c1">
   "I have tried. Honestly, I have tried. But it is of no use. Too
    many years have been spent in my unlawful pursuits, to the
    neglect of the Art. It is now my only source of power, and in
    these times, to be powerless here in Doisettep is to be dead.
    May God have mercy on my soul."
  </blockquote>
  -From the diary of Poltius of the House Tremere,
  1052 AD
  <p>
   They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and
  for many diabolists, this is true. Often, mages come into
  Infernal power unknowingly, or think they're just doing harmless
  research into the enemy. Other times, they are misled by
  disguised demons (my favorite ploy, actually), tricked into
  accepting their offers of "help." And in yet other circumstances,
  the mage finds himself in a position where they only way out is
  to accept Infernal help, help which more often than not created
  the situation in the first place to force the mage into
  Descension.
  </p>
  <p>
   At any rate, there mages eventually learn the true source of
  their new-found power. Many try to give up, and then the horrors
  of Hierarchy loom in the path. Many things can draw the diabolist
  back to evil. The three most common are threats, addiction, and
  despair.
  </p>
  <p>
   The demon who tempted the diabolist in the first place, upon
  finding their charge is threatening to return to the path of
  righteousness, will often create obstacles and threats in the
  path of the mage, conflicts which (the mage believes) can only be
  solved by further diabolic involvement. The demon may also use
  threats, mentioning that the loss of reputation may destroy the
  good that the mage works for (see Piers Anthony's
   <i>
    For Love of
  Evil
   </i>
   ...my, never thought I'd use that as a serious reference
  :) )
  </p>
  <p>
   Then there is the addiction to Hierarchy. This has been more
  fully explained in the new rules section, but is often evoked by
  the demon in charge of the Infernalist's soul. Maybe he just
  leaves diabolic texts lying about all over the place, driving the
  diabolist mad with temptation.
  </p>
  <p>
   The third most common cause of a return to the Infernal is
  despair. Having learned that they have wasted years in the search
  for Ascension, many mages return to Hierarchy in a sense of
  inevitability. This is the ultimate in angst - using Evil itself
  because nothing else is left to them.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Lust for Power
  </h2>
  <blockquote class="c1">
   "Burn, baby, burn!"
  </blockquote>
  -Hot Shot, Virtual Adept Barabbi
  <p>
   For them, the path to Hell is the quest for easy power.
  Whether fueled by jealousy, revenge, or plain madness (and you
  can be sure the demon will fan these flames
   <i>
    most
   </i>
   vigorously), these mages care little for the lack of true
  enlightenment in the Infernal. Power is what they seek, and power
  is what they get. These are the diabolists who are the most
  obvious, and often the most dangerous, since their quest for
  power leads them to powerful talismans and magicks. Those who
  worship evil itself can fall into this category.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Hubris
  </h2>
  <blockquote class="c1">
   "Don't worry, I've got everything under control..."
  </blockquote>
  -Democritus, Order of Hermes (Deceased)
  <p>
   This is the path of Faust: not the Faustus of Marlowe, with
  his party tricks and low buffoonery, buy the intellectual
  everyman of Goethe. Believing they control the powers they
  summon, they fall into the trap of Hubris. Remember, even Mages
  are human: one slip, and the demon has your soul. These mages are
  often the most cunning in hiding the source of their power, and
  this are perfect as the sly, cunning, repeating villain of a
  chronicle. No one can ever quite pin down that smell...is it
  brimestone, perhaps?
  </p>

  Dek!:) )
  </p>
  <h2>
   Vengeance
  </h2>
  <blockquote class="c1">
   "Look, I tried to be a pristine, pious little magus for God,
    but one little mistake, and my powers were gone! I figured,
    there must be an easier way. So sure, I had to deal with the
    element I hated most, but now I can use them to hunt them!"
  </blockquote>
  -Travis MacLeod house Tremere AD 1016 Well known
  deamon hunter, now known to have been in league with the dark
  powers.
  <p>
   Some magi turn because of some terrible event that happened to
  them made them doubt the existence of anything better than the
  dark forces. Some turn because no matter how hard they try,
  nothing goes there way. Travis MacLeod hated deamons all of his
  life, and because of it, he became a pious mage. The life was
  much too hard for him though, and he saught the easier path of
  diabolism. (He is now thought to have a very high rank in hell,
  but to be a mad and incredibly corrupt monster.)

  </blockquote>
  -Niles - Verbena Barabbi (I think... =b)
  <p>
   Some people are just plain evil. A path with the evil one is
  just plain more fun than being a pious innocent person. When
  someone has evil in their veins, being a monster, commiting vile
  acts and the like become everyday things.
  </p>
  <h2>

  <blockquote class="c1">
   "Ah, you poor innocent thing! My name? Ah no, I think I shant
    tell you. To see it would drive you mad, to hear it would soil
    your soul for eternity and to say it would kill you."
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   Some people just figure it's cool to be bad. I dunno...
  wierd.
  </p>
  <h1>
   Even More Insidiousness
  </h1>
  While not originally in this
  writeup, during the course of response Jean-Paul Molyneaux had a
  truly diabolical thought. His suggestion was that as Hierarchy
  increased, a sort of "virtual arete" decreased. Hence, as you
  fell under the sway of greater and greater evil, your true
  understanding atrophies due to lack of use, and more and more of
  your sphere levels become infernal spheres. He also suggested
  this "drop" in arete take place when Hierarchy increased, but I'd
  say you could do it any time. He was measuring this drop by the
  number of infernal points gained. Hence for Arete to drop from 3
  to 2, you'd have to have gained 16 infernal points, the same
  amount of experience it took you to gain that level. If you want
  to thank Jean-Paul for his obvious experience with the powers of
  hell, he's at voca@access.digex.net
  <p>
   I didn't originally think this was a good idea, until Anders
  Sandberg wrote the following...now,
   <b>
    infernalists beware
   </b>
   !
  (At least in my chronicles :) )
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   Actually, if a mage starts to deal with (or serve) the demons,
    he has strayed from the path to Ascension. He will gradually
    loose the real understanding of the world, and have it replaced
    by the infernal lie (Hierarchy), which appears just as potent
    and much more enticing...
   <p>
    If the diabolist repents, he has to regain his inner
    knowledge and free himself from the lies which he has been fed
    (both by demons and by his ego). This is painful and takes a
    long time.
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   Well, I hope that was useful for somebody. Of course, the
  philosophy section was not meant to be all-encompassing. There
  are as many reasons for embracing the Infernal as there are
  Infernalists. If anybody has any comments, suggestions for
  revisions, etc, please,
