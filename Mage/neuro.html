   A Case Study in Experimental Neurophilosophy

   The needle penetrated deeper structures, and Reio shuddered
  with delight as it passed through his nucleus accumbens. But it
  continued, leaving the zone of pleasure and causing a brief
  series of ticks in his face, until it finally lodged in his
  hypothalamus. The world became red with heat and anger, and Reio
  screamed his rage at his captors like a stream of boiling blood,
  throwing himself at his restraints with no effect. Unmoved, one
  of them picked up another needle and began to attach it to the
  stereotaxic frame around his head. "Use the rostral approach for
  this one. We don't want to touch the interthalamic nuclei"
  someone behind him said.
  </p>
  <p>
   As the operation continued Reio began to drift off, to accept
  the warpings of his emotions and personality with a kind stoical
  acceptance. At least until they activated a last needle in his
  left amygdala; suddenly the situation became clear, like
  everything was frozen into a block of cold diamond. He knew and
  understood that he was strapped into an immobile metal
  exoskeleton, a stereotaxic frame screwed into his cranium, his
  brain open to the mercies of his captors and gradually turned
  into a pin cushion of thin silver needles linked to electronics.
  The worst thing was that he didn't feel anything - no anger, no
  fear, no pain, no emotions at all. Just a cold sense of
  certainty.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Feeling a bit better now?" the voice behind him asked. He
  didn't answer, there was no point in it.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Do you know what the limbic system is?" the voice said,
  moving to his right. He glimpsed a arm covered in green cloth
  adjusting some devices. "I'm controlling your
   <i>
    entire
   </i>
   emotional and motivational system now. I control your sense of
  self. Your mood. Your will. Even your urges". The hand twisted a
  dial, and Reio was suddenly filled with lust, insatiable lust. He
  wanted to reach out and fuck them all, to reduce himself to a
  rutting animal. But then the hand twisted another dial, and lust
  smoothly turned into fear. He was completely at the mercy of his
  captors, and they clearly didn't care for him more than the white
  mice he had seen in the adjoining room. When they were finished
  with him, they would just leave him here, his brain exposed
  gradually drying out starting to rot...
  </p>
  <p>
   A twist, and everything was cold and clear again. "See?
  Emotion consists of both arousal and a cognitive component. I can
  change both, and turn any emotion into anything else. I can even
  turn them off completely, although you will lack motivation to do
  anything." The voice moved, and this time he saw its source. It
  was a small man in surgical gown, with large shining eyes
  reminding Reio of a Disney rabbit.
  </p>
  <p>
   "If you were somewhat more motivated, you would ask me why I'm
  doing this". Reio couldn't care less. Why care for the surgeon's
  reasons? Knowing them wouldn't change anything.
  </p>
  <p>
   "I want to ask you a question. You see, I have always wondered
  about consciousness, the mind, emotion. Are they just biochemical
  signals and patterns, information itself, or do they exist on a
  different level from their physical aspects? How can we tell? I
  want to meet consciousness itself, my boy. I'm going to remove
  your sense of self, your emotions, your personality, everything
  except your mind and your consciousness. And when I have done
  that, you will be just Consciousness - the great, undivided
  consciousness that might be inherent in every bit or in all
  matter. Do you understand?"
  </p>
  <p>
   The researcher began to adjust the equipment. The sense of
  reality deepened, until it became almost painful. But when
  another dial marked "cing. gyr." was turned, Reio suddenly didn't
  care about the agonising clarity he felt. The sense of being
  trapped in the metal exoskeleton vanished together with the
  feeling of location. After a while the changes in his mind ended.
  Not much made any sense, but he didn't force it. He just existed.
  The ideas of the researcher were pointless, he saw that now. They
  weren't consistent, and merely an excuse to experiment on him.
  They were a part of him, like everything else. One fragment of
  the whole trying to understand another fragment without realising
  that they both implied each other; any explanation would be just
  a tautology.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Well, it is time to start the second half of the experiment.
  Remove Its cognitive processes and give It 80% motivation. Let's
  see what Reality really wants...".
