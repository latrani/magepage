  <h1>
   The Ruby Labyrinth
  </h1>

  <p>
   The Marauders seldom remain in the same mindset for long, and
  this usually prevents them from creating talismans and artefacts
  - to the relief of all other mages. But the rare marauder
  talismans that appear are often enough to cause a lot of grief.
  Some are "gifts" created to spread dynamism and chaos in the
  world, while others are complete puzzles. The Ruby Labyrinth is
  one of them, created by Master Lanach Ter Bandara just after he
  succumbed to marauderdom in the third century BC.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Labyrinth is carved from a huge perfect ruby, several
  inches across and of course priceless. In shape it is roughly
  cubical, covered with deep grooves forming an intricate labyrinth
  of swirling patterns that seem to extend from the surface into
  its interior, towards the nexus at its centre. Anybody who looks
  into it will feel their gazes drawn toward the centre, where all
  lines converge into - something. No two viewers can agree on what
  it is or how it really looks, but everybody feels strongly drawn
  towards it. Some mages claim the centre represents entropy, the
  regular ruby static reality and the labyrinth dynamism. Others
  see the centre as a symbol or correspondent of the Enigma, the
  true secret of Reality.
  </p>
  <p>
   Regardless of what its nature is, its purpose seems clear to
  anybody who handles it - to find a path to its centre from the
  eight bevels at its corners, to reach some unknowable prize. Each
  bevel is inscribed with a complex symbol, which might correspond
  to a sphere (assuming that the centre holds the ninth sphere).
  But which symbol is which sphere has not been solved. Each detail
  is yet another riddle, driving the reflective mind crazy with
  their hints.
  </p>
  <p>
   As a person tries to find the path (or paths) between the
  bevels and the centre (perhaps the solution is to find the path
  from one bevel to another?), odd things happen. Brief glimpses of
  hidden truths are revealed and tantalisingly vanish; minor
  distractions appear and hinder the solver, and an eerie feeling
  of
   <i>
    foreboding
   </i>
   fills the viewer. If the solver is tenacious
  and persists, he will break through - into the Ruby. Because the
  labyrinth is a trap.
  </p>
  <p>
   Trapped people are only trapped mentally as a pure mind, their
  bodies lie comatose by the ruby. But their minds are trapped
  within walls of blood-red ruby, where tunnels and passages swirl
  endlessly. The only way to escape is to return to the entrance
  point - or perhaps find a way to the centre. The chilling truth
  is that most victims have attempted the latter alternative,
  becoming trapped within the passages driven by hope,
  determination or obsession. If the uninhabited body is not cared
  for it will die, but the trapped minds will remain in the
  labyrinth. Through the centuries many victims have become wraiths
  within the ruby, gradually degenerating into obsessive shadows of
  their former selves.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some desperate entities (they are hardly beings any more, let
  alone human) constantly hunt the passages in search for new
  visitors they try to trick into revealing the path out. As soon
  as they learn this (and they are willing to use
   <i>
    any
   </i>
   available means to do it) they sweep off to the exit and possess
  the empty body of the visitor. If they succeed, they will then
  relish in the base pleasures of the material world more than a
  vampire in lust frenzy, deliberately selecting vices that will
  kill them in ecstasy - anything to avoid the endless state of
  mental twisting they have had to endure inside the labyrinth.
  Many also try to destroy the labyrinth itself, but it has a
  surprising habit of surviving.
  </p>
  <p>
   Adventurous mages have tried using the labyrinth as a focus
  for magick, and to their big surprise succeeded quite well. The
  labyrinth seems to work as a multi-sphere focus for all kinds of
  magick, regardless of sphere. However, there is a small twist.
  Each time paradox hits the mage there is a chance that a backlash
  occurs - a backlash that will rip the mind of the mage into the
  labyrinth. In addition to finding the correct way out, the mage
  has to identify the symbol of the sphere (?) that signifies his
  exit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Master Lanach Ter Bandara died laughing as the Mysteries of
  Hecate finally found his hiding place in the ocean and ripped
  apart his body and soul using their crude bone tools. With him
  died the only chance of solving the labyrinth completely - if
  there ever was one.
