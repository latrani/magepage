    Gibberish (Mind 1/3 Entropy 2):
   </b>
   This rote makes a mage (or
  somebody else) unable to understand anything spoken or written,
  it will just sound like gibberish. It's impossible to discern any
  content of the spoken, and no type of verbal magick will work on
  the person (this rote will immunize against Voice of Command and
  memes). It can also be expanded to other senses, to protect
  against images or gestures, or be specified to work against
  certain words or matters. Some versions even replace a certain
  word with another, making the victim hear disinformation.
   <p>
    <b>
     Osmosis (Matter 1 Mind 1):
    </b>
    The mage "reads" an object
  by holding it, and quickly learn all information it holds. This
  can take different time depending on the amount of information,
  but afterwards the mage can recite everything out of memory
  (hopefully he knows the language). Very practical for books,
  letters or computer disks. The mage doesn't necessarily
  understand the information, but he can recite it or remember
  particular parts.
   </p>
   <p>
    [For electronic media, use Forces 1 instead of Matter.]
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Quick Reading (Mind 1):
    </b>
    The mage increases his reading
  speed far over the normal.
   </p>
   <p>
    [One success doubles it, two triples it, three quadruples it,
  etc. By adding Time 3 the speed can be increased even more.]
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Subprocess (Mind 1):
    </b>
    This rote was perfected by the
  Virtual Adepts. The mage allocates a small part of his mind to
  perform a certain task, like solving a problem or guarding a
  door. The mage will then forget it until the subprocess is
  finished and reunites with the main mind. This can be used to
  hide information from the main mind or plant reminders (Time 1
  can be combined, creating a timed subprocess). Some Virtual
  Adepts have developed recursive subprocesses, which can generate
  their own subprocesses. Several of them have however fallen
  victim to runaway subprocesses which have eaten their brain
  capacity, due to erroneous programming.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Fishing in the Well of Dreams (Mind 1 Spirit 2):
    </b>
    A rote
  the Akashic Brotherhood sometimes uses. They summon their own
  dreams, fantasies, fears and illusions into the waking world so
  they can speak with them, hoping to understand them or banish
  them if needed. The Brother ceremonially washes himself and then
  starts to meditate on the part of his mind he wants to meet. He
  brings it slowly closer to the surface, step by step, until it
  appears clearly to him. This rote is quite hazardous, since it
  can release dangerous aspects of the mage into the light, and
  they might not always be content to return to their old places.
  It has happened that fantasies not only has refused to return,
  but that they have stayed in the world in physical form (so
  called Tulpas). [Using Mind 2 or 3 the mage can summon fragments
  of another present person. Some mages have even sent away their
  own fragments into the minds of others.]
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Detect Disinformation (Mind 1 Entropy 1, often
  Correspondence 3 and/or Time 2):
    </b>
    Many Rosicrucians are
  paranoid about information they receive, and seek to test it to
  see if it is disinformation or lies. This rote was developed by a
  group of especially worried mages, who were barraged by subtle
  disinformation from the Technocracy. They studied the information
  in the mental image of their showstones, invoking Mikael and
  other angels of truth to help them to find falsehoods and lies.
  By seeking internal inconsistencies, they managed to ascertain
  some of the validity. This method was later developed into a very
  efficient rote by adding Correspondence and Time. The mage not
  only studies the internal consistency of the information, he also
  compares it to the causal chains and actual state of the world.
  This might take a long time if it is complex information or
  relates to very specific matters, so the use is somewhat limited.
  However, even a brief check can reveal some types of
  disinformation.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Double Pain (Mind 2):
    </b>
    The mage increases the
  susceptibility to pain of a victim. A small cut will feel like a
  deep gash, and a greater wound will paralyze the victim in agony.
  This is sometimes used by mages in the Akashic Brotherhood on
  themselves to train their resistance to pain and their willpower.
  They just sit down in Do meditation and concentrate of the pain
  of existence.
   </p>
   <p>
    [The wound penalties are doubled for the victim. A Hurt or
  Injured will give a -2 penalty, Wounded -4 and Crippled -10.]
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Voice of Command (Mind 2):
    </b>
    The mage commands somebody
  with his resounding, commanding voice. The victim feel a strong
  impulse to obey the order of the mage. The order has to be short
  and possible to act on directly, since the victim would otherwise
  start to think for himself. The rote cannot overcome what the
  person wouldn't do on his own.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Curse (Mind 2):
    </b>
    The mage curses somebody, often very
  graphically and often using some material implement (waving a
  bone or entrails at the victim, or spitting at him). The mage
  implants a subconscious desire to get hurt. The victim will often
  become unsettled, nervous or depressed. When an opportunity
  presents itself, the subconscious mind will try to make the
  victim hurt himself (or a loved one). Some mages add Entropy to
  "give fate a hand", creating more opportunities for the curse to
  work.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Leave Feeling (Mind 2 Matter 2 Prime 2):
    </b>
    The mage
  focuses on his current emotions and diffuses them through the
  surrounding area, making tiny modifications to things. People who
  enter will feel subtle cues towards the same feeling as the mage
  left. This is often used to create rooms for different purposes
  in eastern chantries, or by the Cult of Ecstasy to enchant places
  they like.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Dominion (Mind 2 Prime 2):
    </b>
    The mage surrounds a room or
  other place with symbols of himself (for example his coat of
  arms, his monogram or something else). The mage becomes master of
  the area, making everybody inside obey him without question as
  long as they are inside. Everybody feels the presence of the mage
  intensely. The mage becomes the central point of the room.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     The Garden of Delight (Mind 2 Life 2):
    </b>
    Originally
  invented by the Cult of Ecstasy, but later used by the
  Euthanatos. They turn the doll upside down and sensually stroke
  it with their weapon. The victim will experience all pain as
  intense pleasure. A pinprick is a pleasurable tickle, a stabbing
  knife an orgasm. Some Euthanatos use the rote to make honored
  persons perform the good death on themselves.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Sight of Cerberus (Mind 2 Correspondence 1):
    </b>
    The mage
  expands his mind in all directions. Should it find another mind
  filled with enmity directed against him personally the mage will
  immediately know it, and knows the exact position of the enemy.
  As long as the mage uses this rote he is safe from ambushes.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Inner Music (Mind 2 Forces 3 Prime 2):
    </b>
    All people have
  their own inner music, but few can hear it and even fewer can
  express it outside themselves. Most people who try simply fail to
  convey the exquisite harmonies they find. However, an unknown
  Cultist of Ecstasy during the middle ages developed this rote to
  bring the music into the world. By connecting the subconscious of
  a person with the ability to create sound, the mage could make
  the mental music heard. The result was often staggeringly
  beautiful. However, the music also influenced the person who
  created it in unexpected ways. Since it symbolized the
  personality and whole mind of the person, it seemed to reinforce
  his most dominant traits. Fundamentally happy people become even
  happier when they hear their exorbitant music. Sad people become
  even more depressed by hearing their ominous music. Confused
  people become more confused while intellectuals are filled with
  the urge to study and understand.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Create Meme (Mind 2/3 Prime 2):
    </b>
    Memes are mental
  viruses which spread from mind to mind, things like rumors,
  catchy tunes, good jokes or catch phrases. Virtual Adepts have
  found them to be excellent weapons to sway public opinion and to
  influence people. Generally mages design memes by concentrating
  on the message they want to spread, and then let their creative
  juices flow. Usually they suddenly find a especially catchy way
  to convey what they want. It can be anything, ranging from jokes,
  catchphrases to pieces of music. When memes are set loose, other
  people will find them catchy and repeat them, spreading them
  quickly. They are powerful weapons, but can turn against their
  creators. Just like living beings they can mutate and evolve,
  sometimes far beyond the wildest expectations of their
  creators.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Somebody Else's Problem (Mind 2 or 3):
    </b>
    The mage dampens
  the interest of something, for example himself. The victims won't
  notice anything unless it's spectacular, and will lose it unless
  he keeps his eyes on it. A person with SEP can walk down a street
  without being noticed or remembered, but a security guard will
  probably stop him if he tries to enter a restricted area (the
  guard is on lookout for any intruder). With Mind 3 the mage can
  erase all perception of himself, which turns him invisible for
  all practical purposes as long as he don't break the illusion by
  attacking somebody, turn over something or collide with someone.
  This type of protection/invisibility is very common. Cabalists
  use the Yetziratic Sealing Rite, Rosicrucians the Rose-Cross
  Ritual, Akashic Brothers special silent Do-movements and Verbena
  wear protective amulets carved with the athame.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Inner Journey (Mind 3):
    </b>
    The mage enters a deep trance
  and enters himself mentally, as if he went on an astral journey.
  He will enter his own inner world, where all his dreams, memories
  and thoughts are represented. He can then wander just as if he
  was in a normal realm. Mages can find the most surprising things
  in the labyrinth of the mind, dreams, memories of forgotten
  persons, old hobgoblins and subconscious horrors may appear,
  speak to him or even attack. There might be portals from old
  dreams to the chimerae. To end the journey the mage has to return
  to his starting point, where he will awaken. One of the greatest
  risks with such inner journeys is that the mage may not find his
  back again (or that he don't want to, after finding a place, a
  dream or memory so lovely that he will never leave it). Some
  mages spend much time in their own or other (Mind 4) minds. With
  some extra mental magick the mage can bring others into the
  trance.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Open the Abyss (Mind 3):
    </b>
    The mage sends the mind of the
  victim down into the Great Abyss. The body will collapse in coma.
  The victim cannot experience anything else but emptiness and
  cannot do anything other than think. Most people turn insane
  after a few days (if time can be said to exist for them). In the
  beginning they just fall asleep, but then they start to drift
  between dream and wakefulness, unable to tell the difference.
  Hallucinations and delusions appear, and the personality begins
  to dissolve without any sensory impressions. Some advanced
  members of the Akashic Brotherhood meditate in the Abyss,
  sometimes for months and there are rumors of a monastery where
  several monks lived for years in the Abyss.
   </p>
   <p>
    [Each day inside the Abyss the victim has to succeed with his
  Willpower against 8 to retain his sanity. If it fails the
  Willpower is decreased by one. A botch creates a permanent loss,
  and when it reaches zero the victim is incurably insane.]
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Candace's Divination of Personal Facts (Life 1, Mind 3) by
  Deidre:
    </b>
    Allows the mage to divine personal info about a
  person. Height, age, real hair color, number of children, etc.
  One question answered per success.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Reveal the Wandering Carcasses (Matter 1 Mind 3):
    </b>
    The
  mage searches the vicinity for minds coupled to matter, not life.
  This will reveal undead beings and other non-living creatures.
  Sons of Ethers use their meters, which they direct towards
  suspects and compare their readings with standard levels.
  Choristers touch people with their holy symbol and watch their
  reactions.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Genetic Memory (Mind 3 Life 1 Time 2):
    </b>
    This rote was
  originally an ancient Verbena rote, but it has been adopted by
  many life and nature-oriented mages. The theory is that memory is
  retained in the blood (or genes) of people, and their descendants
  can access it with the proper methods. This allows them to learn
  from the experiences and mistakes of the ancients. Verbena use to
  draw a drop of blood with their athame and then meditate on the
  subtle nuances of the taste.
   </p>
   <p>
    [Each success will double the number of generations backwards
  the mage can feel. One success allows the study of the memories
  of the mage's parents. Two reaches the grandparents, three
  reaches back to the great-great-grandparents, etc. Note that only
  memories up to conception are available from the father and up to
  birth from the mother.]
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Test the Traitor (Mind 3 Entropy 1, sometimes Time 2):
    </b>
    This rote is used to test initiates of the Rosicrucians to see if
  they are possible traitors. It is often used during the
  initiation ceremony just as the initiate is shocked or is busy
  concentrating on something else, since the psychological defenses
  will be weaker. The users (often several older Rosicrucians
  working together in secret) try to find weak points in the
  devotion to the Rosicrucian ideals and possible treasonous
  thoughts. They watch the mind of the person with their
  showstones, comparing it to the purity of their seals. The mages
  also use Time if they can, to see if there is any chance the
  tested person will become susceptible to such ideas or have been
  subjected to them.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Mental Similarity Detection using Consciousness Resonance
  (Mind 3 Correspondence 2 Life 1):
    </b>
    A Son of Ether once wanted
  to find out if somebody else was keeping a defector from the
  Technocracy under surveillance. He built an electronic device,
  which connected electrodes on his head and a sensitive antenna to
  a resonance circuit. His theory was, that if somebody was
  watching the defector, the mental patterns of the other would
  match his own as he was watching the defector. This would cause a
  resonance in the detector, which could be measured. He also added
  a biofeedback monitor to the system, to be able to find out some
  physical characteristics of the other person. The device turned
  out to be both efficient and almost paradox free, and now is
  standard equipment in many of the local mental experiments.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     See Through Borrowed Eyes (Mind 3 Correspondence 2):
    </b>
    The mage "borrows" the senses of another person. The victim will
  notice that he is experiencing things a little differently, but
  not how.
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Floodland (Mind 3, Entropy 3) Sons of Jupiter, by
  Jack Dracula:
   </p>
   <p>
    A great delaying tactic, this rote was invented by Yomphana
  (yoyo), one of the Sons diametrically opposed to the Euthanatos.
  It floods the target's mind with all sorts of random thoughts
  from everyone in the area. This makes it virtually impossible to
  concentrate on anything.
   </p>
   <p>
    [For every success the Mage makes in the roll, take away one
  dice from the target's dice pools.]
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Read the Akashic Records (Mind 3 Correspondence 3):
    </b>
    The
  mage expands his mind into the Subconscious of the vicinity,
  seeking the answer on a specific question or the solution of a
  problem. The mage can coordinate information from all minds
  around himself, and find the solution even if no individual can
  solve the problem. Masters of the Akashic Brotherhood sometimes
  use it on their disciples to gain insight themselves. Some
  Choristers expand their minds enormously, so that the encompass
  millions of minds, as a form of meditation. This is a bit risky,
  since they risk loosing themselves in the mass and let horrors
  from the Collective Unconscious possess them.
   </p>
   <p>
    [Each success will work as one point dream during the
  scene.]
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Visionquest (Mind 3 Spirit 2):
    </b>
    (Also known as Vision
  Thing among the Hollow Ones). A rote used by gnostics,
  dreamspeakers and hermetics. The mage puts himself into a state
  of gnosis by intoxication, fasting, pain or pleasure. As the mage
  sinks into a trance, he will begin to see visions of the world
  around him, the Umbra and his own mind. The world seems to become
  fluid in the perception of the mage, constantly changing and
  reforming. If the mage concentrates on a problem or a question
  the visions will begin to reflect this. Using a visionquest, a
  mage can understand the secret connections and symbols he
  normally wouldn't understand. Unfortunately the mage seldom
  remembesr anything about what he saw afterwards, and becomes very
  incoherent during the quest, which severely limits the use of the
  rote. Many Gnostics use their acolytes to write down what they
  see during their visions, and afterwards try to understand what
  they discovered. A mage undergoing a visionquest is in serious
  danger from his subconscious, which may erupt into his visions if
  it contains strong negative emotions, traumas, or illnesses. Some
  spirits may also seize the opportunity to enter the mage's
  consciousness as his defenses are down.
   </p>
   <p>
    [During the vision the mages dream, intuition, enigmas,
  cosmology and occult are increased by the number of successes. On
  the other hand, willpower and all social and mental attributes
  are halved (round down). This should really be roleplayed.]
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Mental Bomb (Mind 3 Correspondence 2):
    </b>
    This rote is
  originally a Marauder rote, used to harass the Technocracy. The
  mage simply connects all the minds in the vicinity to each other,
  allowing them to share their thoughts and feelings. The result is
  usually total, self-enforcing panic which can turn normal people
  into a stampeding mob in seconds. Using Mind 4, the mage can
  control the mob, and use it as a crude but very deadly
  weapon.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Transplant Skills (Mind 3 Correspondence 2):
    </b>
    In some
  cases a mage might need a skill or ability he doesn't know. To
  ameliorate this problem, someone invented this rote. The mage
  simply reaches into the mind of somebody with the necessary
  skill, and taps it. The donor doesn't notice anything except that
  he tends to think a lot about the skill for no apparent reason,
  and that he gets strange glimpses of the situation of the mage.
  The mage, on the other hand, can use the skill for the duration
  of the rote, but caution is advised. The minds of people are tied
  closely together, and one cannot just grab a single skill without
  expecting other things to follow. Mages who use the rote report
  that their personalities sometimes temporarily change towards the
  personalities of the donor, and that they sometimes get strange
  impulses or memories from the other person.
   </p>
   <p>
    [Each success will allow one skill level to be borrowed from a
  donor. The borrowed skills will completely replace the mage's
  own, but may be supplemented with Dream for a truly dangerous and
  psychedelic effect. However, if the mage gets more than two
  successes his Demeanour will change to the Demeanour of the donor
  of the skill for the duration of the rote. If he gets four
  successes, his Nature will change too. Mental quirks and insanity
  may also be transmitted in this way. If the mage is searching for
  a rare ability, Correspondence 3 may be used.]
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Predictive Psychological Profile ( Mind 3, Entropy
  2, Time 2, sometimes Correspondence 3) by Michael M. Moolick
  (moolick@shrsys.hslc.org):
   </p>
   <p>
    When the New World Order needs to counter an individual's
  actions badly, they often order a Predictive Psychological
  Profile to be compiled. They gather all known information about
  the subject. This includes all NWO records (which often extend
  back to birth), and any records they can obtain from other
  conventions. Any information they can find will be incorporated
  into the profile.
   </p>
   <p>
    The statistic formula of the rote make a paper "simulation" of
  the person studied (they try to avoid using computers, many of
  them feel the mind is better than a computer anyways). The
  person's personality, motivations, and random events are taken
  into account to determine the person's goals and what actions he
  will be likely to take in order to reach them
   </p>
   <p>
    The NWO mage will include Correspondence three to predict not
  only what and when the actions will be, but where as well. The
  agent can then send Men in Black to intercept or ambush the
  victim.
   </p>
   <p>
    [Creating a Predictive psychological profile is a lengthy
  process. The mage is allowed to roll one die every two hours the
  data is sorted through and organized. Fortunately the rote is
  considered coincidental in most cases.
   </p>
   <p>
    The base difficulty is five for a sleeper and seven for a
  mage, as being awakened makes someone considerably more
  unpredictable (the sole known exception to this is It X mages,
  who are often tremendously predictable). A victim's Arcane rating
  is added to the difficulty, so a mage with Arcane 4 or 5 is such
  a mystery man that a profile can't be created without extreme
  effort (quintessence and a
    <em>
     long
    </em>
    time), there just isn't
  enough correct data on the mage.
   </p>
   <p>
    NWO investigators who use this rote are almost always put
  under surveillance. As the rote requires the mage to examine the
  subject's world view enough to understand and predict it, it's
  use has been known to cause doubt, confusion, and even defection.
  They do not hesitate to pull an investigator "off the case" if he
  gets too involved.]
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Oath (Mind 3/4 Correspondence 2 Prime 3 Matter 2/3):
    </b>
    Another way of keeping their members loyal is the binding oaths
  used by the Rosicrucians. When a initiate swears his Neophyte
  Oath, this rote is used in some lodges. It creates a link between
  the oath, the mage and a material object (sometimes a drop of the
  initiate's blood, or his signature or a symbol fashioned during
  the ceremony). If the initiate ever breaks the oath, the link
  will shatter, causing some kind of change in the material object
  (the blood will burn, the signature fade or the symbol shatter).
  By using more powerful mental magick, the link can remind the
  mage of his duty if he ever thinks something contrary to the
  oath. Some groups have developed a more fearsome version, which
  will attack the oathbreaker (often using Forces, Life or Spirit,
  depending on the casters).
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Program Bio-Expert System (BES) (Life 3 or 4, Mind
  3 or 4 Prime 2) by (moolick@shrsys.hslc.org):
   </p>
   <p>
    Virtual Adepts researching biocomputers have made some
  progress. They have developed this rote, which allows them to
  make a computer inside someone's brain/mind and program it as an
  expert system. Mind and Life 4 are needed if the mage wishes to
  create a BES in someone other than himself.
   </p>
   <p>
    The mage first prepares a generally unused portion of brain
  cells with life, and programs them with mind while balancing the
  necessary prime. The system is programmed with abilities,
  downloaded as memories from a donor and placed in the recipient's
  mind as a program.
   </p>
   <p>
    The result is a small autonomous computer system within the
  recipient. The abilities the system is programmed for will kick
  in automatically whenever the recipient tries to perform actions
  they would normally be used in. The BES gives the recipient no
  knowledge of the process, which occurs in a manner similar to
  automatic writhing, tasks are performed without knowledge of how
  or sometimes even what is being done.
   </p>
   <p>
    For example, a person with a Brawling BES might have no idea
  how to fight, but the system will cause their strikes to hit
  appropriate areas of the enemy without their even considering
  it.
   </p>
   <p>
    One "Dirty Virtual Adept Trick" arises from the fact that the
  BES kicks in automatically. A VA can program a person with a BES
  which has less dots in a skill than the recipient. Every time the
  recipient tries to used the skill, the BES takes over and
  prevents him from reaching any potential higher than that of the
  BES.
   </p>
   <p>
    [Each success gives the BES one dot in an ability taken from a
  donor. No BES can have more than four dots in any one skill, more
  dots in an ability than the donor, or abilities from two or more
  donors.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unless the mage succeeds in making the BES permanent, it will
  eventually degrade, possibly causing seizures or psychological
  problems. Trying to use the Dream background has unpredictable
  effects. It has been totally successful in some cases, caused
  deep quiet in others, and cause mental damage in the
  unfortunate.
   </p>
   <p>
    No person can have multiple BES' These systems have been known
  to implant personality traits of the donor into the recipient and
  cause amnesia when running.
   </p>
   <p>
    All in all, Adepts feel a very great deal more of research can
  go into the BES field. Some are even working at simulating a
  Trinary Computer in their own mind so they can do magick with no
  external focus (they haven't come close yet).
   </p>
   <p>
    Paradox can strike a BES programmer easily by possessing the
  BES and taking over the recipient.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unconfirmed rumors report Progenitors are working on BES and
  other biological computers as an alternative to Iteration X
  hardware. They also hint the New World Order is considering
  establishing "Monitor" BES systems in sleepers to control
  them.]

     Deep Programming (Mind 4 Prime 2, sometimes Spirit 2):
    </b>
    The mage enters the mind of a person (often while the person is
  asleep or in trance) and reprograms it in secret. The most common
  use is to place suggestions or ideas into the subconscious, where
  they will trickle to the surface. Other possibilities are deep
  hypnotic suggestions giving the mage control over the actions or
  thoughts of the victim, mental blocks of certain memories,
  placing "trapdoors" which will give the mage a way around mental
  defenses or even the creation of full-fledged sub-personalities.
  The last use, often called Invocation of Thelemic Beings, is
  sometimes combined with Spirit too. Such sub-minds will be
  independent from the main mind, and may influence it, read its
  thoughts or do other things on a mental level, as programmed by
  the mage. This is a subtle way to sneak around enemy mental
  scanning.

     Uploading (Mind 5 Correspondence 1):
    </b>
    This rote is the
  holy grail for many Virtual Adepts, the final escape from the
  flesh into pure information. By connecting the brain of a person
  to a very powerful computer, they can read it into the machine
  and create an Upload, a total copy of the person complete with
  memory, personality and avatar. An uploaded person will continue
  to exist indefinitely inside the computer as a AI-program, and
  can move around and work magick as usual. Its not uncommon to
  increase the mental speed and capacity of uploads once they are
  inside the web, and many have integrated themselves with
  semi-autonomous programs to function better. They have no ties at
  all to their old bodies, which tend to die fairly quickly anyway.
  Uploads exist only in the web, and must interact with the
  physical world through interfaces and devices connected to the
  web. It is also possible to download a mind into a body, but this
  often causes problems with the mind already present. Blank
  clone-bodies work very well for this use, and according to rumors
  the Virtual Adepts, Iteration X and Progenitors work together in
  secret to perfect the processes of uploading/downloading.
