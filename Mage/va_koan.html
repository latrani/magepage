    Once a student asked Moore: "If all objects we see are parts
  of the user interface, then why not regard their graphic
  representations as part of the model?". Moore answered: "are
  their coordinates arbitrary?". "Yes, of course". "Then the model
  is arbitrary". The student was enlightened.

     A master once asked Moore: "What is between the one and the
  zero". "Line noise".

      When a thunderstorm hit the system, several terminals broke
  down and had to be repaired. "This wouldn't have happened if we
  had had a voltage surge protector", one electrician pointed out.
  "Does the voltage surges need to be protected?" asked Moore. "No,
  the terminals". "Well, protect the lightening instead, it is much
  more general".

       A student had created a clever pattern in Game of Life, and
  proudly showed it to Moore: "I can prove that it's behaviour is
  undecidable, since it is equivalent to the Halting Problem".
  Moore ripped out the power cord from the computer, and the
  pattern vanished. "It has halted" he said. The student was
  enlightened, but the pattern was lost.

        "Why do we have to learn about electronics when we seek to
  become software engineers?" an impatient person complained. Moore
  overheard it and plunged a soldering iron into the complainer's
  workstation: "So that the software has somewhere to live".

         One day a student asked Moore: "Does Marvin Minsky know what
  he is talking about? Is the mind really a society of independent
  agents?". "Why did you ask?". "Because if that is true, then
  there is no
         <i>
          me
         </i>
         ". "Is there a Minsky?". The student was
  confused, and told Minsky about it; Minsky smiled and said:
  "No".

          When a virus attacked the system, Moore was unperturbed and
  didn't try to remove it: "It is not proper to do it before
  observing the correct signs". "What are they?" asked a fellow
  master. "To watch the network load grow, to sacrifice the root
  partition to nothingness and to see the users learn fear."

           "Is there
           <i>
            anything
           </i>
           other than information in your
  world?" an ironic philosophy graduate once asked Moore. "No. That
  question was never asked".

            A student was struggling with his project, but with no
  success. Finally Moore asked him what the problem was. He
  answered: "I try to make this distributed database automatically
  migrate to unused nodes, but my processes deadlock since they
  cannot synchronise over the net?". "Are they all running in the
  same direction?". "Yes, of course". "Well, backtrack randomly in
  time then". The student was enlightened, and the program ran.
