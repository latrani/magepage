     The Technocracy have many spies among the Traditions.
  Following the old intelligence acronym MICE (Money, Ideology,
  Coercion and Ego) they have convinced many traditional mages to
  serve them in various ways. Although many mages won't admit it,
  power and wealth can be tempting even for the Awakened, and the
  Technocracy has plentiful of both. Other mages are convinced that
  it furthers the interests of their own tradition, cabal or
  chantry to support the Technocracy, usually against their
  enemies. The Technocracy is of course well known for its coercive
  methods, ranging from Syndicate extortion to Progenitor clones.
  And finally, there is the most insidious trap of all: the
  Ego.

      Vance
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Vance is a young Orphan. He awakened in a car accident when
  his entire family was killed; the entire car and its contents
  just dissolved into blinding light and he ran away unscathed. For
  several years Vance grew up on the streets, slowly learning about
  his powers through trial and error. When he attracted the
  attention of a cabal of other mages, he grudgingly accepted their
  promises of training and protection. He never really fitted in
  with the traditional mages, and usually felt they dragged him
  along more as an interesting experiment than a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then the Technocracy struck. The cabal had been investigating
  the ties between a local politician and a group of drug-dealers,
  and this alerted the Syndicate. The cabal found itself under
  attack from every direction, and they sought to cut their losses
  and flee from the city. Vance was left behind as the rest escaped
  in a van, perhaps by mistake, perhaps because he realised they
  had no chance. The van was destroyed in an "accident" on the
  highway. At the same time he was approached by a smiling man in
  an expensive suit, who invited him to come to his limousine to
  discuss a business proposal. Vance, ever the survivor, naturally
  accepted and began working for the Syndicate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Vance is no more loyal to the Syndicate than he is to anybody
  else. He knows he is expendable, but as long as he provides them
  with interesting information and minor services, he will get paid
  and appear useful. He is drifting between various groups of
  mages, mainly the Cult of Ecstasy and the Hollow Ones, never
  remaining long enough to arouse suspicion. He sells various
  titbits of information to the Syndicate in exchange for money or
  Tass. He is constantly on the outlook for interesting
  information, and would not hesitate to dig a bit if he finds
  something really juicy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Vance isn't very impressive; a skinny, rather pale youth in a
  worn leather-jacket and faded jeans carrying a rucksack with his
  belongings. He isn't very social, but usually remains just
  outside groups of people, listening and looking vaguely
  uncomfortable. Somehow, people always feel sad for him and try to
  introduce him into the group. His magick is almost always
  coincidental, mainly Mind and Correspondence.

            Doctor Jonathan Terman
           </span>

        </br>
       </br>
      </br>
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     Dr Terman is a respected Son of Ether, involved in several
  projects to bring true Science and Technology to the Sleepers.
  His most notable contribution has been a method to turn waste
  from the food industry into a light and strong plastic,
  "Bioplast", more versatile than normal oil-based plastics.
  Naturally he has had a few problems getting it into the Paradigm,
  but he is generally optimistic. Other areas of his research has
  been radio-projection, where radio can be transmitted using
  "virtual antennas" projected into the air (its untraceability has
  interested the Virtual Adepts) and a system of beamed powerlines
  not unlike the work of Tesla.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, he has recently begun to worry about the other
  traditions. In his contacts with environmental groups among
  Sleepers and mages when he tried to interest them in his plastic,
  he noted many environmentalists who dislike all advanced
  technology, regardless of how ecological it is. They apparently
  wants to return to a more "natural" lifestyle, somehow removing
  all the unnecessary gadgets and banning all "non-appropriate
  technologies". As a true etherite, Dr Terman was appalled. And
  the worst thing was that these groups got much of their
  inspirations from hardliners within the Dreamspeakers and
  Verbena, who definitely wanted to end the "decadent technomantic
  western civilisation".
    </p>
    <p>
     Dr Terman realised that even if the other mages belong to the
  Traditions, they constitute a threat against the more
  technologically oriented Traditions. They would certainly try to
  stop them from advancing if they got a chance. So he decided
  to
     <br>
      do something about it. Using his skills of manipulation of
  radio-waves, he found a frequency and coding scheme used by the
  Technocracy. From time to time he sends information about the
  activities of the hardliners within the Traditions to the
  Technocracy using his untraceable radio-projector. The
  Technocracy apparently approves of his initiative, and he has at
  least once got a "Thanks. Keep up the good work." message
  back.
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     Dr Terman certainly don't see himself as a traitor or spy. It
  is the "econazis" who are traitors against the Traditions, trying
  to sabotage the work of the Etherites and Virtual Adepts. He
  would absolutely never transmit anything he thought could hurt
  anybody else, and the thought of receiving payment for his
  information is alien to him. He prefers to think that he is
  balancing the situation a bit, so that he and his tradition can
  help the Sleepers undisturbed.

    <p>
     Patricia is a member of the Cult of Ecstasy, who once had the
  misfortune in participating in an ill-planned attack on a
  technomancer stronghold inside an office building. Her entire
  cabal was captured as the elevator car they were in was
  filled
     <br>
      with a strong narcotic neurotoxin before they were even close to
  the technomancers (if they ever existed). After months of
  gruelling interrogations and reprogramming, the New World Order
  released her with a new set of memories. She no longer remember
  how they reprogrammed her, but now she has complete memories of
  how she was kept prisoner by the Technocracy, resisted their
  horrible torture while her friends slowly broke down, and finally
  escaped using an ingenious Time effect. The whole experience has
  filled her with an unrelenting hatred for the Technocracy and
  especially the NWO.
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     She is currently doing her best to coordinate other mages into
  attacks on the Technocracy, finding weak points in their
  defence
     <br>
      and tracking down and eliminating their allies. Her hatred has
  however not made her stupid, and she will not take
  unnecessary
      <br>
       risks. After all, dead mages cannot fight. Other mages regard her
  with a bit of unease due to her fierce hatred, but everyone
  accepts her dedication and trust her. And everyone agrees she has
  an uncanny insight in the methods of the Technocracy.
      </br>
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     What nobody knows is that the she also works for the NWO. "The
  best way to learn about a conspiracy is to start it yourself".
  Since Patricia is actually behind the attacks, the technomancers
  will know about them beforehand and can prepare. Usually they
  remove key personnel and important experiments, but sometimes
  they set up ambushes to capture and neutralise important or
  dangerous mages. They just make sure she from time to time appear
  to win an important victory.
    </p>
    <p>
     Patricia is controlled using special code words. If she hears
  a certain sequence of words embedded in a sentence, she will turn
  into a loyal (if somewhat impersonal) servant of the Technocracy.
  She will then answer any questions or report what she has
  learned. A second sentence will return her to normal. She has
  been conditioned to regularly dial her beloved "parents" (her
     <br>
      real parents are dead), who will debrief her. There is also a
  another group of code sequences which will activate some of her
  real memories. If they are just activated to a sub- or
  semi-conscious level, she will feel intense pain, fear and guilt.
  If they were revealed in their totality, its quite probable she
  would turn completely insane.
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     Patricia is a smallish woman with extravagantly coloured hair
  in original hairstyles and an otherwise incongruous vaguely
  British appearance. While she is usually smiling and polite, her
  eyes reveal her hatred for the Technocracy: every time the
  subject is brought up they harden into pools of darkness and her
  left hand will make snaking, aggressive motions. Her magick
  reflects this too: her usually beautiful and fragile webs of
  magick turn into killing shards against her enemies, without any
  trace of elegance
     <br>
      or remorse.

        OPEN FILE

      </b>
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     Open is one of the more influential Cypherpunks among the
  Virtual Adepts. He has a solid reputation for the brilliance and
  flexibility of his encryption schemes, not to mention his style.
  Everybody admires him for his skill in hacking the computers of
  Iteration X, where he frequently has found very exciting
  information, including secret passwords or control codes. What
  nobody have even guessed is that he actually is working with the
  Technocracy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Open learned everything he knows from his mentor Core 1, an
  older Adept who was one of the minds behind their defection from
  the Technocracy. However, Core told him that the real reason for
  the defection was quite different from what the rank-and-file
  Adepts thought. The leaders of the Technocracy had realised that
  the Adepts were becoming more and more uncomfortable within the
  bureaucratic framework of the Technocracy, and sooner or later
  this friction would cause real trouble. Therefore they developed
  a brilliant plan: they would let the Adepts defect to the
  Traditions. In this way the Technocracy could use the resulting
  chaos to purge itself of useless or disloyal members, force many
  departments to rationalise and become more efficient to meet the
  new threat, leak enormous amounts of misinformation and most
  importantly: gain a foothold within the Traditions. Outside the
  Technocracy, the Adepts would continue their research, apparently
  in conflict with It, but secretly allied. They would gather
  information about the Traditions and relay it back, until the day
  when the Technocracy would strike a decisive blow against the
  Traditions with the help of the Adepts, who would then yet again
  become a convention in the victorious Technocracy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Open has succeeded Core as the informal leader the secret
  cabal, Exit(0), which is coordinating the Adepts in their
  clandestine mission. Exit(0) gathers information from the entire
  Tradition (quite easy, due to the freedom of information in their
  nets) and relays it to the Virtual Adepts still inside the
  Technocracy. They also manipulate their tradition in various ways
  to make sure it serves its real purpose. They carefully list
  various members and their loyalties, influence internal politics
  and recruit the best and brightest for their cause.
    </p>
    <p>
     Open is especially involved in making sure the Cypherpunks
  won't become too dangerous. He reports about any new encryption
  schemes developed, and has created several systems himself with
  secret trapdoors for the Technocracy to use. He is also involved
  in spreading misinformation by pretending to hack into Iteration
  X systems and revealing false data.
    </p>
    <p>
     Open is proud to be a part of the secret leadership of the
  Virtual Adepts and working for its real goal. He suspects that
  there might be other, similar cabals, but it doesn't bother him
  since he realises the gravity of their mission. Some secrecy and
  redundancy is always needed. From time to time he despairs at the
  huge task he has undertaken, and secretly wonder how the
  Technocracy ever will manage to complete Its plan. But he quickly
  forgets his doubts and turns to the important work at hand
  instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     Open's icon in the net is a humanoid shape created out of
  thousands of file icons, which open to reveal their contents as
  he moves. Few other people have met him in the flesh, where he is
  an apparently normal man around 30 years old. In the net he
  usually speaks in a flowery language interspersed with
  cryptographic terms and odd allusions to programming. His many
  friends usually joke about it as "Open Dictionary".
