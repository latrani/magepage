     The Speech of the High One:
    </h3>
    <i>
     I know I hung on that
  windswept tree,
     <br>
      Swung there for nine long nights,
      <br>
       Wounded with my own blade,
       <br>
        Bloodied for Odinn,
        <br>
         Myself and offering to myself,
         <br>
          Bound to the tree
          <br>
           That no man knows
           <br>
            Wither the roots of it run.
            <br>
             <br>
              None gave me bread,
              <br>
               None gave me drink,
               <br>
                Down to deepest depths I peered
                <br>
                 Until I spied the Runes.
                 <br>
                  With a roaring cry I seized them up,
                  <br>
                   Then dizzy and fainting, I fell.
                   <br>
                    <br>
                     Well-being I won
                     <br>
                      And wisdom too.
                      <br>
                       I grew and took joy in my growth:
                       <br>
                        From a word to a word
                        <br>

    From the Poetic Edda
    <hr>
     <h2>
      History of the Asatru
     </h2>
     The Verbena have always been
  regional, and differ much from area to area. In Scandinavia, the
  Verbena have been the protectors of the old religion and the old
  ways against the tide of Christianity and the Technocracy.
  Actually, the Verbena was behind the Old Faith of Asatru which
  ruled before Christianity. Asatru means the "belief in the
  Aesir", the old pagan gods.
     <p>
      During the pre-Christian times they were the priests and
  counselled the leaders about the will of the gods. Their magick
  was devoted to practical things like helping the crops, fishing
  and hunting, protecting the people from wild animals and worse,
  controlling the weather and protecting the universe from the
  forces which sought to bring about Ragnarok, the destruction of
  the world.
     </p>
     <p>
      During this time magick was more common than today, and most
  people knew a few minor magics. These were often of a simple
  protective nature and used to protect against spirits, the
  faeries, the dead, injuries, accidents and bad luck. These magics
  consisted often in inscribing a special rune (The runic alphabet
  was regarded as magical, and to be able to inscribe runes was
  regarded as a kind of magic), or singing the galders, songs sung
  in a high-pitched voice. These rotes were passed down through
  generations, or given to people by the priests or sibyls. All in
  all, minor magic seems to have been quite common, a bit like how
  most people today know a few tricks with technology.
     </p>
     <p>
      Year 829 AD a monk named Ansgar arrived in Sweden. He was sent
  out by emperor Ludwig to convert the Vikings of Sweden to
  Christianity (perhaps to lessen their raids and make them easier
  to trade with). The attempt failed, but soon other missionaries
  arrived. The Celestial Chorus were probably among them, and a
  struggle ensued between the pagans and the Choristers. The
  struggle continued for several centuries, but Christianity slowly
  became the religion of the kings and leaders and later the rest
  of the inhabitants. Both groups adapted to each other, and it
  seems as the Asatru went underground and continued its activities
  with support from the people, while the Choristers left them and
  their beliefs more or less alone as long as they weren't visible.
  Then came the Technocracy, which defeated the Celestial Chorus.
  Asatru remained hidden.
     </p>
     <h2>
      Asatru Today
     </h2>
     Today the Asatru has survived in remote
  corners of Scandinavia. During its long persecution by the Church
  and Technocracy its members have become adept at hiding, often in
  plain sight. Much of the old faith has survived as old
  superstition and local customs, and the secret priests have
  carefully protected the faithful. Most of the believers live in
  rural or wilderness areas far from civilisation. They live in
  small settlements in the forests of Sweden, in small fishing
  villages in Norway or in the remote corners of Iceland (their
  current stronghold). Some of them emigrated to America during the
  1800s and built their own small communities there, far from
  civilisation. They often keep to themselves, and avoid outsiders.
  The belief often goes in the family, tying the tradition together
  with bands of blood.
     <p>
      While their enemies control the political world and society at
  large, the believers in Asatru work on the local scale, with
  practical methods. They promote their own and similar beliefs,
  often spreading the old superstitions to undermine the new faith.
  They have succeeded very well with spreading respect and affinity
  to nature among the masses in Scandinavia. They infiltrate
  agricultural organisations and influence their work, often using
  them as tools to strike at the projects of the city-dwellers.
  They promote a healthy xenophobia to protect their old customs
  from the influence foreigners and city-dwellers. In fact, many of
  them are supporting local low-level nationalism and racism to
  encourage the sleepers to become more tied to their roots and to
  mistrust anything else.
     </p>
     <p>
      Their relations to environmental organisations are a bit
  ambivalent. On one hand they support them, since the protection
  of nature is one of their own most important tenets, but on the
  other hand they regard the environmentalists as do-gooders from
  the city who doesn't know anything about the real problems and
  only care about cute seals or flowers, not the uglier aspects of
  nature. In fact, many of the believers work against the
  environmentalists, seeking to protect their land and way of
  living against environmental laws or restoration programs which
  they regard as yet another way for the masters to try to wipe
  them out.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recently some New Agers have begun to worship the old gods and
  form different groups more or less based on Asatru. The real
  mages view this with scorn, and generally dislike them. The New
  Agers have just borrowed much of the names and myths, and then
  turned them into yet another fuzzy and nice mythology. The real
  Asatru believers scornfully remark that most of them don't even
  sacrifice blood on the blots. However, some of the real believers
  have begun using these groups as places to recruit people and a
  way to gain a foothold into the cities. Since most of the New
  Agers are so easily manipulated, they provide quite useful pawns.
  The same is true about neo-nazis, which the believers subvert by
  their magick and their grasp of ancient myth. They can be used in
  a similar manner, and are a very good method of harassing their
  enemies or diverting the attention of media and government from
  their own activities.
     </p>
     <h2>
      The Faith
     </h2>
     Asatru revolves about the worship of the old
  gods, the Aesir. They represent the forces which have formed the
  universe, and still uphold it. By worshipping them the believers
  help upholding the universe against chaos and destruction, and
  may also gain help from them. Unlike modern monotheistic
  religions, does not demand that the believers should serve the
  gods. Instead the gods will help those who ask them for help in
  exchange for following their ideals and respecting them. This
  doesn't have to be much, a salutation or a small sacrifice of
  some food and drink is often enough to make the gods friendly.
  Anyone can perform the small acts of devotion to get the help of
  the gods.
     <p>
      However, the mages are more advanced than this. They are the
  priests of the cult, and arrange the larger celebrations, the
      <a href="ftp://io.com/pub/usr/mimir/asatru/blot_ritual">
       Blot
      </a>
      .
  Blot are by tradition held at the Sabbaths, especially at the
  four equinoxes. The blot are mostly held in remote places, where
  the worshippers can meet without suspicion. In Sweden the
  cult-places are often glens with one or more oaks around it, on
  Iceland old stone-circles are used. The blot generally involve
  the ritual sacrifice of animals whose blood are used to ensure
  fertility, harmony and the old ways. The priests collect the
  blood in the hlautbowl, consecrate it to the gods and sprinkle it
  using evergreen twigs at the trees, on the idols of the gods and
  on the participants. Afterwards the blot turn into a feast where
  the
      <a href="ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/religion/neopagan/Asatru/Sundry/animal_sacrifice">
       meat from the sacrifices is eaten.
      </a>
     </p>
     <p>
      The tree is a sacred symbol to the, symbolising the World Tree
  Yggdrasil. Yggdrasil is a great ash, which grows through the
  worlds of the dead (Hel), the living (Midgard) and the gods
  (Asgard) and upholds creation. It must be protected from the
  forces which seek to kill it, because if it dies the world will
  be destroyed. That's why the priests carefully water it with the
  blood of the blot, and seek to heal any damage to it they are
  able to heal.
     </p>
     <p>
      The gods are not representations of abstract forces, but
  powerful beings which happen to be good at different things. They
  are not the ultimate lords of the universe, merely the creators
  of it and the currently most powerful beings. They might be
  powerful, but they have a human side and can become angry, drunk,
  fall in love or otherwise behave like normal humans, just on a
  higher level. The most important gods are:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Odin
      </b>
      is the oldest and most powerful god. Together with
  his brothers Vile and Ve he killed the giant Ymir and shaped the
  universe out of the dead body. He is the god of wisdom, magick,
  war, death and leadership, riding on his eightlegged horse
  Sleipnir to oversee battles together with the valkyrias. If he
  throws his spear Gugner over somebody, that person will die in
  the fight. Odin has two ravens, Hugin and Munin, who spy on
  everything that happens and whisper it into his ears. He is also
  one-eyed, since he gave his right eye in deposit in the Well of
  Wisdom.
     </p>
     <p>
      The sacred animals of Odin is the horse and raven, and he is
  also the god of the hanged ones (because he voluntarily hanged
  himself on Yggdrasil as a sacrifice to himself to gain the secret
  knowledge of the runes). At blots in his honour in the autumn the
  priests hang horses and people in the trees as sacrifices. They
  are left hanging so the ravens can gorge themselves on the
  carcasses.
     </p>
     <p>
      The god of thunder,
      <b>
       Thor
      </b>
      , is rather well known. The red
  bearded god races across the heaven in his chariot drawn by
  goats, throwing his hammer Mjolnir at the trolls and giants,
  protecting mankind and gods from the forces of evil. He is the
  god of strength, fighting provess and the forces of nature,
  especially lightening, but also farming and marriage. The sign of
  his hammer scare away the trolls and elves, and give protection
  from lightening.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Frey
      </b>
      and his sister
      <b>
       Freya
      </b>
      , are the gods of
  fertility, growth and love. Both are extensively worshipped to
  ensure the harvests, good weather, health and virility. Both are
  described as blond and fair, and Frey is often depicted as a
  sitting figure with a drinking horn and large phallus. The sacred
  animal of Frey is the boar and of Freya the cat. They are the
  most often invoked gods at the blot, and while Odin and Thor are
  generally mentioned first, Frey and Freya are the ones that most
  worshippers really love. The Blot of Spring is celebrated in
  honour of Frey, so that he will bless the crops and livestock and
  make the weather good during Spring and Summer. Horses and boars
  are sacrificed in his honour, and usually the worshippers select
  a young, blond man who will represent Frey during the
  celebrations. The god is then carried around with great
  adoration, and he blesses the fields and worshippers. The Blot of
  Midsummer is celebrated to Freya, so that she will make the men
  virile and the women fertile. The participants sing bawdy songs
  and engage in ritual sex.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Balder
      </b>
      is the god of light and peace. He is said to be
  the most beautiful and shining of the Aesir, and both wise,
  eloquent and helpful, although a bit impractical. His sacred
  plant is the mistletoe, because he was killed by an mistletoe
  arrow fired by his blind brother Höder (who was fooled to
  fire by the treacherous Loki). It is to his honour the Blot of
  Midwinter is celebrated, so that the light will return to the
  world.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are many other gods revered by the worshippers.
  Heimdallr is the perceptive sentinel of the gods, standing watch
  at the rainbow for any intruders into Asgard. Skadi is the wild
  goddess of hunting, roaming the mountains in the winter with her
  bow and her wolves. Her husband Njord is the god of the sea,
  fishing and travel. Loki is the god of fire, deceit, wits and
  theft who causes and solve problems. Idun is the goddess of
  health and longevity, and her husband Brage is the god of poetry.
  Frigg, the wife of Odin, is the goddess of home and motherhood.
  Tyr is the god of war and bravery. Hel is the dark goddess of
  death. And so on, there are many lesser deities revered in
  special situations.
     </p>
     <h2>
      Philosophy
     </h2>
     "Once upon a time there was only the great
  void of Ginungagap. When the ice from Nifelheim (the world of ice
  and mist) and the fire from Muspelheim (the world of fire and
  heat) met in the void, they created the immense giant Ymir. The
  three brothers Odin, Vile and Ve, the grandsons of Bure, killed
  him, and formed the world out of his body. His blood became the
  seas, his bones became the mountains, his flesh became the earth
  and his skull became the sky.
     <p>
      However, Bergelmer, one of the sons of Ymir, survived the
  cataclysm of his fathers death. He swore revenge against the
  gods, and his descendants, the giants, still seek the undoing of
  the gods and to destroy the world. They are helped by the giants
  from Muspelheim and Nifelheim, the traitorous Loki and his three
  children Hel, the Fenris wolf and the Midgard serpent. One day
  Ragnarok will come, when the world and most of the gods will die.
  Before it there will be the great Fimbulda-winter, three winters
  in a row without any summer between. War and violence will spread
  across the world, and the three roosters will signal the final
  day to the gods, the giants and the dead. All bonds break, the
  dead invade the world, the gods and giants kill each other in
  battle, the sun darkens and the World Tree Yggdrasil catches fire
  and falls, taking the world with it. But from the wreckage a new
  world will emerge, with clear waters and lush vegetation. The
  fields will bear crops without any planting and Balder will rule
  with peace and light.
     </p>
     <p>
      That is why we must protect the world as long as it stands. We
  must fight the forces that seek to bring it down, be they
  supernatural or mundane. We must keep Yggdrasil healthy and
  strong, heal its wounds and fight its enemies. We must keep the
  giants and the dark forces at bay. We must protect the old
  traditions of the blot and the runes, so that the people will not
  forget the gods entirely and the gods will not forget us. We must
  strengthen the people so they will fight bravely against the
  forces of death and destruction, or the giants will surely
  win."
     </p>
     <h2>
      Organisation
     </h2>
     The believers congregate around sacred sites
  and are led by their priests. These priests are generally equal,
  although the oldest and most respected of them lead the others.
  Different groups have little contact, but sometimes priests
  contact neighbouring groups to discuss mutual problems.
     <h2>
      Meetings
     </h2>
     Mainly at the equinoxes, especially Midwinter,
  Spring and Midsummer. Also some ceremonies at the other Sabbaths
  and at special occasions (often just to celebrate and thank the
  gods for success, or to ask them for help). Beside the blot, many
  worshippers hold small "prayer meetings" where the participants
  toast the gods, sing the ancient songs and sacrifice some food.
     <h2>
      Initiation
     </h2>
     The initiates are mostly chosen among the
  faithful. One common way to awaken the initiate is to
  ceremonially hang them in a sacred oak, and let them hang there.
  The delirious initiate will undergo the same visions that Odin
  saw when he hung himself, and will thus become awakened, or the
  initiate will die and become a sacrifice to Odin.
     <h2>
      Chantry
     </h2>
     Asatru has no true chantries. There have been no
  real chantries in Sweden since the burning of the temple of
  Uppsala around year 1100, and probably no others in the rest of
  Scandinavia. Instead the believers often form small isolated
  communities, where they can practice their religion in peace. The
  acolytes most often come from these communities.
     <h2>
      Acolytes
     </h2>
     Farmers, survivalists, neo-nazis, fishermen and
  hunters.
     <h2>
      Sphere
     </h2>
     Life. The priests especially devoted to Odin
  generally learn about Mind and Prime, while the priests of Thor
  learn Forces and Matter. Female priests tend to concentrate on
  the preparation of potions,
     <a href="ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/religion/neopagan/Asatru/Customs/make_mead.gz">
      mead
     </a>
     and the singing of galders, while male priests learn the
  art of the runes. The völvas are the only mages who deal
  mainly in Spirit and Time (see below).
     <h2>
      Foci
     </h2>
     <h3>
      Blood: Life, Prime
     </h3>
     This is the most important focus. The
  blood of the sacrifices is especially powerful, and the
  sacrifices from the blot is the best. Human blood is naturally
  powerful, and the blood of voluntarily sacrificed believer have
  amazing power. The bloodline is important, and royal blood is of
  course the most powerful (in the old days the priests used to
  sacrifice the king to stave off famine if it looked really bad).
  In using the blood, it is important for the mage to give at least
  some to the gods to show respect, otherwise they might become
  angered. However, in Life magick other bodily fluids can be used,
  especially in magick regarding to the giver.
     <h3>
      Bowl: Entropy, Spirit
     </h3>
     This is known as a hlautbowl, where
  the blood or drink is first poured and consecrated by the priest.
  It is often a wooden or silver bowl with intricate ornaments.
  Hlautbowls are often inherited through generations in families of
  believers, and regarded as sacred.
     <h3>
      Herbs: Matter
     </h3>
     This works as normal for Verbena, but
  substances from the animal or mineral kingdoms are sometimes
  used. Some specially important substances are oak leaves,
  mistletoe, salt, yeast, earth, iron, snake venom, ice and
  poisonous mushrooms.
     <h3>
      Hammer: Correspondence, Forces, Time
     </h3>
     This is the hammer
  of Thor, Mjollnir. Most often it is a small stylised hammer worn
  around the neck. Currently this is rather popular fashion in
  Scandinavia, so it is easy to hide. In earlier times the mages
  sometime used crosses to hide their true faith.
     <h3>
      Circlet: Mind
     </h3>
     This circlet imitates to the Brosingamene,
  the silver necklace worn by Freya. According to
     <a href="ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/religion/neopagan/Asatru/Stories/brosin_myth">
      one myth
     </a>
     , she has to let Loki wear it half of the year after
  he stole it and tricked her into his debt. During this time
  nature vanes and darkness reign, but in the spring she will wear
  it again and become happy, thus ensuring spring and summer. It
  thus represent both the allurement of Freya and the cunning of
  Loki, a fitting symbol for Mind.

       Rotes

     </h2>
     <h3>
      Heritage of the Blood (Time 2 Life 1)
     </h3>
     In ancient time,
  the god Heimdallr travelled the land, and sired the thralls, the
  bards, the farmers and the jarls (the leaders). The trace of the
  god is still upon the people, and a priest knowledgeable in the
  ways of the blood can still see it. By feeling the force in the
  blood, the mage can follow the lineage back through time to its
  source, and see which group someone really belongs to. This is
  also used to trace the lineages, and find those special
  bloodlines which contain the life of the people.
     <h3>
      Brew Venom (Life 2 Prime 2 Entropy 1)
     </h3>
     While the Vikings
  regarded poison as foul, some of the modern mages use it in the
  defence of their homes and traditions. By boiling together a foul
  mixture of blood, salt, yeast, earth, iron, ice and some drops of
  snake venom under invocations of the powers of death, they create
  a potent and untraceable poison. The poison can be applied in
  food or drink, placed on weapons or even on surfaces. The poison
  will seek out the weakest point of the victim and make him very
  sick or kill him.
     <p>
      [ The poison works as an infection or other disease,
  completely coincidental. Typical effects can be heart attacks,
  allergic reactions or food poisoning. It will find the weakest
  point in the body of the victim using an effect like Dim Mak and
  then strike. It does three times the number of successes damage
  levels. ]
     </p>
     <h3>
      Magic Mead (Matter 2 Prime 2 Mind 2)
     </h3>
     By adding special
  herbs and some blood to mead and then brewing it together, the
  priestess can create a mead which will infuse the drinker with
  the emotions of the her choice. This is used to create the mead
  drunk during the blot, or a subtle way of influencing people.
     <h3>
      Mead of blood (Life 3 Prime 2)
     </h3>
     This rote may have started
  as a kind of travesty of the Catholic Mass. By pouring mead into
  the bowl and adding a few drops of blood, the priest can turn it
  into blood. However, it doesn't have to look like blood or taste
  like it, the priest can make it appear to be normal mead.
  Afterwards, the mead can be used instead of blood as a foci, be
  imbibed as a source of strength or even used as sustenance for
  vampires (although practically no modern kindred know about this.
  Only the oldest Scandinavian Methuselahs have tasted such mead).
     <h3>
      <a name="GALDERS">
       Galders
      </a>
     </h3>
     Galders are magickal songs
  sung in a peculiar high pitched voice, with simple and practical
  effects. These were the most common type of personal magick
  during the old days, and were completely coincidental. However,
  as reality became more rigid, they became harder to sing with
  effect, and today only the priests can use them. They have some
  peculiar advantages and disadvantages; on one hand they do not
  require any foci except the song itself. However, the only
  galders which work today are those which have been sung since the
  old days, and it is impossible to create new galders with power.
  It seems as if they have become locked into static reality and
  cannot change anymore. Naturally, the mages have spent much time
  preserving and researching the old songs, but unfortunately only
  a few are known. Here are some typical examples:
     <p>
      <b>
       Ettergalder (Matter 1)
      </b>
      This galder was used by the
  legendary Egil Skallagrimson when he suspected that his drink was
  poisoned. He sung it to the mug, and it shattered, showing that
  the contents were poisoned.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Frostegalder (Life 1)
      </b>
      This galder protects from cold
  and freezing. The mage sings the galder to his flesh and limbs,
  making them liven up and get warm again.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Runegalder (Prime 1)
      </b>
      This galder makes the runes in the
  vicinity of the singer to shine with their light, making them
  easy to read. By the intensity of the light the mage can se how
  powerfully they were inscribed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Gastegalder (Spirit 2)
      </b>
      This galder protects from ghosts
  and other denizens of the night. By singing it the mage can scare
  away most of the lesser unbeings.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Bragdegalder (Mind 2)
      </b>
      This is a rousing galder which
  inspires frenzy and bravery among those who hear it.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Giljegalder (Mind 2)
      </b>
      This galder evokes loving feelings
  from a person of the opposite sex.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Lösegalder (Matter 3)
      </b>
      This is a galder which helps
  mages who have been imprisoned. The mage sings the galder to the
  bonds, which will release him.
     </p>
     <h2>
      <a name="RUNES">
       Runes (Prime 3)
      </a>
     </h2>
     The art of carving
  runes is one of the best kept secret of Asatru. Even Odin had to
  pay dearly for the secret. Once anybody who knew how could carve
  the magical runes, but today they require quite powerful magick
  to create. The physical shape of a rune is no problem, but
  creating the secret pattern inside which gives it power is hard
  today after the activities of the Church and the Technocracy.
  Each rune has to be consecrated with a drop of blood by the
  carver while he whispers its secret name and concentrates, and
  the inscription must be charged by tass. However, when finished,
  the text of runes will work as a kind of talisman, retaining its
  powers as long as it is charged. If they are recharged or placed
  on a place where they can recharge from the environment they will
  last nearly forever. (like on the runestones, which are often
  placed on ley-lines or nodes. Many retain their power even today)
     <h3>
      Vigrunor (Entropy 1 Mind 2 Prime 3)
     </h3>
     These are runes which
  are inscribed on a weapon under invocations to Tyr, and will give
  the wielder success in battle. He will be able to see the
  weaknesses of his enemies, become brave and fearsome to his foes.
     <p>
      [ The Entropy effect will make the user notice the weaknesses
  of his foe, while the two Mind effects will make him brave and
  fearless while his foes will become nervous. ]
     </p>
     <h3>
      Bränningsrunor (Entropy 2 Prime 3)
     </h3>
     These runes
  protect ships at sea from accidents and wreckage. They are
  inscribed on the bow and on the helm.
     <p>
      [ The runes will protect from all random accidents and give
  the helmsman a subconscious ability to find the best course
  through storms and reefs. Each success will add to his skill.
  ]
     </p>
     <h3>
      Lemrunor (Life 4 Prime 3)
     </h3>
     These runes are the most potent
  way of healing somebody there are today in Asatru. Once this type
  of healing was quite simple, but it has turned hard. The priest
  writes the runes on the bark of a tree, usually with the blood of
  the patient. This creates a potent healing force that will seek
  to heal the patient continuously, thus overcoming and hindering
  even the most serious diseases as long as the runes are inscribed
  on the tree. However, the runes can also be used to curse,
  causing wounds or sickness in the same way as they can heal. By
  adding or deleting a rune, the inscription can be turned around,
  which makes it important to keep them secret from enemies.
     <p>
      [ The runes will seek to heal any wounds and sickness of the
  person they mention. Each time he is hurt or become sick, the
  runes will get a chance to heal him. If they cannot heal him
  completely, they will at least prevent any worsening of the
  condition.]
     </p>
     <h3>
      Protection Runes (Varies, Prime 3)
     </h3>
     These runes are
  inscribed on the runestones marking and protecting the old nodes
  and ley-lines. Usually they consist of nasty and powerful curses
  (generally the most powerful the present priests can invoke). If
  the runes are destroyed, the flow of power through the stone is
  disrupted or somebody moves it, the curse will activate. This has
  given the Technocracy in Sweden a lot of problems in the past
  when they have wanted to move the ley-lines. Currently they
  simply let the stones stand (and actually protects them, to avoid
  having any spurious magick getting loose) and lead new ley-lines
  around them.
     <h3>
      Edsrunor (Varies, Prime 3)
     </h3>
     These runes are used to seal
  oaths, deals and curses. When finished, they force the parts to
  obey to the text. If any part breaks it, he will suffer the
  effects described. These are usually the worst possible curses
  the priest can do, and it is not uncommon to add curses beyond
  the ability of the mage just for effect. In the case of pure
  curses, the victim is forced to obey the caster or suffer the
  full curse. These texts are usually inscribed on stone or wooden
  boards, and then often placed in sacred places for safekeeping.
  The only way to remove a curse is to find the runes and erase
  them, but some really cunning mages write them on pine-needles
  and scatter them in the forest.
     <h2>
      Seid (Spirit, Time)
     </h2>
     The magick of the Asatru does not
  deal much with the world of spirits or advanced forms of
  divination. That was the realm of seid, a kind of magick not done
  by the normal priests and mages. It was originally a type of
  magick of the Lapp shamen of northern Scandinavia, and it was
  regarded with suspicion and fear. Today it is more accepted, but
  still it remains a slightly separate tradition. However, some
  elements has been incorporated into modern and is used by
  specialised priestesses, known as völvas. They are
  respected, but a bit apart from the priesthood of the Aesir. They
  are recognised by their magickal rods (völva means literally
  female bearer of a rod), which are their unique foci for Spirit
  and Time. Some völvas are even said to fly on their rods, or
  on wolves. Their link to this rod is so strong, that they are
  said to protect it even after their own death.
     <p>
      Seid involves ecstatic trances, where the völva can
  communicate with the spirits and see the future and past. These
  are achieved by her sitting on a special settee singing certain
  ancient galders (or having acolytes sing them at her). These
  galders are reputedly both beautiful and terrifying, but seems to
  send the völva into trance. Now she can go out into the
  spirit world, summon the dead, see past and future or reveal the
  hidden secrets.
     </p>
     <h2>
      Talismans
     </h2>
     <h3>
      Idols (Talisman 1)
     </h3>
     Iron or wooden idols of the gods are
  placed around holy places or in shrines in the homes of
  believers. Some are enchanted and have special powers. They are
  often offered small sacrifices in exchange for working, and some
  believers even thank them with blood if they have done especially
  well. Most popular are idols of Frey, which promote fertility and
  virility when kept in the house and good crops when placed by the
  fields. Instead of a humanoid idol a phallus is sometimes used.
  Idols of Thor protect against lightening, faeries, ghosts and
  evil forces (sometimes just a stylised hammer is used). Idols of
  Odin are rare and regarded as a bit spooky, and most are placed
  as guardians around sacred places (especially where oaks grow).
  They will somehow alert the worshippers that somebody is coming.
  Idols of Heimdallr are used similarly, but are often placed in
  the home too. Idols of Skadi gives good hunting and Idols of
  Njord helps sailing and fishing. Idols of Frigg are placed by the
  beds of children to protect them and keep them healthy.
     <h3>
      Bolverk (Talisman 2)
     </h3>
     This is an old Viking sword, with a
  dull and dark finish which won't go away regardless of any
  attempts of polishing it. When it is drawn from its scabbard it
  emits a hissing noise, like a snake. Its name means "Bringer of
  pain/evil", which is also one of the titles of Odin. According to
  the myth, the sword was forged on the autumn solstice by a priest
  of Odin, who had turned to the dark aspect of his god. It was
  later wielded by the infamous Ingjald Two-Tongue, and was
  reputedly buried with him. But it has reappeared since then,
  according to the legend wielded by the Wraith of the cruel
  Ingjald. Besides being eternally sharp, regardless of how dull it
  looks it has the nasty effect of causing excruciating pain from
  any wounds. There are also rumours that it actually seeks contact
  with living flesh to cause more pain, and will cut through the
  skin of anybody touching it carelessly just to cause pain.
     <p>
      [ A Matter 1 effect keeps it eternally sharp. A Life/Mind
  effect doubles all wound penalties made by the sword, and bruised
  is at -1. ]
     </p>
     <h3>
      Spawn of Draupnir (Talisman 2)
     </h3>
     One of the most prized
  possessions of Odin was the ring Draupnir, which every ninth
  night spawned eight similar rings. Some of these rings also had
  the power of multiplication, and a few seems to have been
  accidentally given to humans (or stolen). These rings look like a
  heavy Viking ring of pure gold, artfully ornamented into three
  dragonsnakes braiding together and biting their tails. If left
  alone, it will spawn eight similar rings every ninth night. It
  was originally made by the dwarves, and no dwarf can resist any
  chance of getting the ring, by whatever means.
     <h3>
      Rod of the Völva (Talisman 3)
     </h3>
     Some of the
  völvas enchanted their rods so that they could be used more
  easily. By holding the rod and going into a trance (or being
  sleepy, drunk or something like that), the wielder will get
  visions of the past, present and future. These visions are
  partially random, partially controlled by what the user want to
  see (not only consciously, but also subconsciously), and may be
  dangerously biased. Some rods are still strongly influenced by
  their makers, and will be biased towards their views. The link
  between the rod and the original owner is often so strong, that
  it is possible to communicate with her soul in the realm of death
  (note that most völvas have no grasp of modern languages).
  How she reacts to the mage who disturbs her sleep depends much on
  how she is treated and what he asks her. Some völvas are
  happy to help in any way they can, while others trick and curse
  people seeking help.
     <p>
      [ The rod uses a Correspondence 3 Time 2 rote to show distant
  places and times for the user, and a Spirit rote to contact the
  dead völva. ]
     </p>
     <h3>
      Mead of Poetry (Artefact)
     </h3>
     The gods created a man called
  Kvaser as a part of a peace treaty after a civil war. Kvaser was
  the wisest man who has ever lived, and was able to answer any
  question. He travelled around the world giving advice and helping
  people, but one day he was invited as guest by two dwarves called
  Fjalar and Galar, who killed him. To the gods they explained that
  Kvaser had gagged on his own wisdom, since nobody could ask him
  enough. The dwarves brewed the Mead of Poetry out of his blood,
  which was able to turn anyone into a great poet by drinking it.
  After many adventures the mead was finally stolen by Odin, who
  drank most of it and gave some to his fellow gods and some
  humans. There may still be some mead left somewhere, and if
  anybody find it and drink it they will gain the gift of poetry.
