It makes a great deal of sense, to me, given that Mages tend to route
powers/effects (and hence Talismans) into items/ideals specific to their
paradigm -- and what is that for a Virtual Adept if not computer
software?  (Well, maybe computer hardware, but don't sharpshoot me here)

If done with sufficient subtlety (and, obviously, coincidence), I could
see these programs being Talismans usable by Sleepers.  I even have a
real-world example (see below, though it's more a Meme than a Talisman).

Obligatory Story:  OxDEADBEEF (Talisman oo)

                   Once upon a time, in that apocryphal 1950s-1970s time
                   in which all computer-scientist folklore takes place,
                   there was a programmer (perhaps even a team of
                   programmers), and a computer.  Some say it was an
                   antiquated IBM-series mainframe with 3270 terminals.
                   Others insist it was an early Apple.  Still others 
                   steadfastly maintain it was a high-end HP server.
                   The truth has probably diverged into a multiplicity
                   of individual stories.  But I digress.
 
                   This computer, as do many such machines, displayed
                   many of its error messages as hexadecimal numbers
                  (for the uninformed, hexadecimal is 0123456789ABCDEF).
                   It was, therefore, somewhat inconvenient to the
                   designers when, at a nationwide convention, their
                   exhibition mainframe went down (crashed), screen
                   displaying only the string "OxDEADBEEF" ('Ox'
                   meaning 'hexadecimal,' DEADBEEF being the actual
                   error number (a number just over 4 billion, possibly
                   a memory address but more likely a nerd-in-joke).

                   Anyway, OxDEADBEEF seems to have worked its way into
                   consensual Sleeper reality, as a sort of idea-virus,
                   which I have found to have the following effects:

                   Sense Computer Literacy (Mind o)

                             When 'OxDEADBEEF' is mentioned, either as
                             part of this anecdote or by itself, the
                             caster is able to sense general computer/
                             programming aptitude (likely Computer ooo
                             or higher, if the listener even understands
                             what the caster is talking about).

                  You're a Geek (Mind oo)

                             Those computer-elite who find themselves
                             able to understand what OxDEADBEEF means
                             immediately find themselves overcome with
                             shame, revulsion, and self-loathing ('I'm
                             a geek!  I have no life!  I can't BELIEVE
                             I'm so obsessed with computers that I 
                             understood what OxDEADBEEF meant!').

                             This generally lasts for a few moments, or
                             until dispelled by a change of subject.
