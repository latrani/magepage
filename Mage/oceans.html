  The true World of Darkness exists beneath the
  surface of the sea, inaccessible and unknown. Less is known about
  the oceanic depths than about the planet Mars, a place which
  appears almost familiar compared to the alien life and
  environment of the deep oceans.
  <p>
   It is an important fact that very few people actually live or
  move across the oceans, compared to the dry land. Ships usually
  follow the main routes and the large majority keeps within
  sighting distance from land; those ships who do not are alone on
  the ocean, usually without any other human being or man-made
  artefact in sight. And very few humans have ever travelled
  through its real depths, most keep to the surface. Actually,
  mankind has a very tenuous grip on the oceans and their reality.
  While the Gauntlet on land and in the air are kept strong by the
  collective beliefs of people, the oceans are immense weak spot in
  the Gauntlet. It is no wonder that seamen still tell tales about
  strange beings or bizarre events they have witnessed, and that
  superstitions still abound on the sea. Of course, the reasonable
  land-crabs quickly discount all this as the result of boredom,
  natural phenomena and alcohol.
  </p>
  <p>
   While the Gauntlet is weaker across the oceans, it becomes
  even more frail in the depths. Mankind have never visited many
  places in the deep ocean, and outside these reality is still
  original and alien. In fact, large volumes are immense openings
  in the Gauntlet, huge threats to the stability and sanity of the
  surface world. The beings who live here are even strange by the
  bizarre standards of the depths, and they swim freely between the
  oceans of the Umbra and Earth. The real reason creatures from
  these depths die when they are brought to the surface is often
  not the pressure or temperature difference, but simply paradox.
  They are things that should not be.
  </p>
  <p>
   The surface layers are usually quite safe, at least as deep as
  sunlight dares to penetrate (at depths beneath 100 meters the
  only light is dark indigo, slowly fading into black). In the
  nights the Unknown creep closer to the surface, only to return at
  dawn. Certain kinds of shrimps and squids seems to follow these
  movements, perhaps feeding on the flows of Quintessence, and
  occasionally the black predators of the deep also gather to feed
  on the surface dwellers. Perhaps surprisingly the ocean floor is
  also relatively safe, the real danger is in the unmapable volumes
  of darkness above them. Here the darkness is only broken by the
  eerie glow from the few luminescent creatures, and most of them
  are predators preying on each other or the scraps from the
  surface. The sparse life here is strongly affected by the close
  presence of the Unknown, and many beings might even originally be
  from the outside. Most are grotesque but fairly inconsequential,
  but among them are some real threats.
  </p>
  <p>
   The giant squids are some of the least understood denizens of
  the deep; only a few cadavers have been found, and all of them
  quickly decompose into ammonia-stinking piles of flesh in air.
  They can become at least 18 meters long, and cachalots and other
  whales are often seen with scars from their suckers. It is widely
  believed that toothed whales feed on the squids, but nobody knows
  for certain.
  </p>
  <p>
   The truth is darker: the giant squids are actually not from
  our reality. They are intruders from the Deep Umbra, perhaps
  scouts from the Things Beyond, perhaps trying to establish a
  foothold (tentaclehold?) in our oceans. They are darkly
  intelligent but so far limited by the paradox of the surface
  world and the attacks of the whales. They are able to use their
  unknown senses to manipulate other squids and octopi (which might
  actually be descendants of their old servants), watching through
  their eyes and feeling through their tentacles.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, they are strongly opposed by the true rulers of the
  sea, the cetaceans. Apparently the cachalots are involved in an
  immense war against the squids in the black deeps, driving them
  back to their own reality and guarding the openings to beyond.
  While whales and dolphins certainly aren't intelligent in a human
  way, mages who have had mental contact with them report that
  their minds are both agile and complex, but their alien
  environment and senses makes actual communication very hard; we
  simply have very little in common. However, they have abilities
  which sometimes seems to be very close to magick; at least the
  great whales are able to break through the Gauntlet into the
  Umbra, and many reports claim dolphins sometimes seems to have an
  uncanny knowledge (or control) over the weather, currents and
  geography around them, not to mention some kind of empathic
  powers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ironically, these abilities caused the tragedy of the whales.
  When the Technocracy began to understand in the 1700s how they
  could swim between realities, it was horrified and quickly
  decided to put an end to it. They strongly encouraged whaling,
  and through advances in technology they began a wholesale program
  of extinction against the great whales. It was very successful,
  and the technocrats congratulated themselves to a victory against
  the dangers of the Outside while the giant squids grew in power.
  Finally, in the 1960's a young Oceanographer realised the awful
  truth about the increased incidence of reality instability on the
  oceans and the extinction of the whales. His impassioned speech
  and irrefutable evidence stunned the symposium, and the Syndicate
  quickly made whaling uneconomic. Today the Technocracy seeks to
  understand the cetaceans better, in a late attempt to win some
  allies or at least find out what is really going on.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the dolphins may have their own dark designs. While
  they certainly appear friendly and playful, a few people have
  begun to worry about their presence and empathic abilities.
  Dolphins are appearing more and more as symbols, and many
  aquariums have been forced to close after the number of visitors
  have dropped inexplicably. Are their black eyes and toothy grins
  hiding something?
  </p>
  <h2>
   Other Powers
  </h2>
  However, there are many other dangers in and
  on the oceans. Nowhere else are the natural forces as strong as
  here, and even the Technocracy has to admit that it is far from
  harnessing their power (yet). Even modern ships have a hard time
  handling a tropical hurricane or the winter storms of the
  Antarctic ocean. The elementals of air and water found at sea are
  much more powerful than their domesticated cousins at land, they
  are wild and free and quite able to wreak havoc to mages unwise
  enough to summon them when they feel playful or angry. Marine
  nature spirits are less human than the spirits of the land, and
  often have very different perceptions and goals, which often
  makes dealing with them much harder. Some just want to flow as
  they always do, according to the wind, the currents and the
  tides, while others want to churn and crush and foam.
  <p>
   However, there are other beings at home in the sea than
  spirits. The faeries have always had a strong tie to the oceans,
  and the underwater courts use the ocean itself as a protection
  against banality. The faeries of the sea mostly keep to the
  bright upper layers, where they build their castles out of coral
  or explore underwater forests of kelp. Mermaids, sea monks and
  tritons roam these enchanted worlds, blissfully unaware or
  uncaring of the surface world and its banal inhabitants.
  </p>
  <p>
   But the sea is cruel too, as many wraiths know. The border
  between life and death is thinner here, and during storms it can
  open completely in some places, as the crew on Marie Celeste
  found out. The spirits of all those who died at sea whisper in
  the waves, and the servants of Oblivion constantly seek to lure
  ships to their doom or into the frequent maelstroms. Some marine
  wraiths use their arcanos to inhabit sea birds, especially the
  albatross (giving rise to the myth that the spirits of dead
  sailors become albatrosses) The Flying Dutchman is just one of
  the best known ghost ships on the ocean.
  </p>
  <p>
   There are also rumours of something else, something immense in
  the deepest depths of the ocean, both in the Umbra and physical
  world. Nobody knows what it is, but its awesome presence is said
  to be felt across the world by those attuned to it. Some mages
  call it Leviathan. Maybe its the incarnation of the unknown sea
  itself.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Technocracy in the Oceans
  </h2>
  The Technocracy is aware of
  the dangers below, and the conventions are frantically seeking to
  build a better defence. The Void Engineers and Iteration X are
  the driving force in this project, the Ocean Development Program
  (ODEP). The Void Engineers have by tradition always upheld the
  Gauntlet, but they also have been the explorers and
  cartographers. The marine environment is just as alien and
  hostile as outer space, and many of the technologies developed by
  the space programs are applicable here, and vice versa. The
  Oceanologists, the methodology involved in the ODEP project, are
  studying all aspects of underwater exploration and colonisation.
  They develop new submarine crafts and habitats, study the
  hydrology, geology and ecology of the oceans (in close
  association with the Progenitors) and plan for the eventual
  large- scale colonisation of the oceans by the masses, which will
  once and for all make their reality static and provide immense
  living space to mankind.
  <p>
   Iteration X on the other hand sees the oceans as a vast
  untapped potential for industry and technology. They map mineral
  resources and encourage their exploitation in collaboration with
  the Syndicate, they develop robotic vehicles to visit the most
  extreme and dangerous depths, and discreetly plan for a total
  industrialisation of the oceans. The mineral nodules they have
  found across the ocean floor are making the syndicate really
  excited and could provide the boost necessary to make deep ocean
  mining economic. There are already plans for robotic underwater
  mining vehicles or deep sea factories, and the difficulties the
  Oceanographers have with scaling up their life support systems
  only encourages the use of machines instead.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Progenitors have always been interested in oceanic life,
  but either the interest have been practical (as in increasing the
  efficiency of fishing or sea-farming) or purely theoretical (like
  the study of the deep ocean vents). They gather data and
  specimens from the other conventions, slowly developing a model
  of the ecologies of the deep. One area they have been very
  interested in is dolphin intelligence; are the dolphins truly
  intelligent, and do they share the abnormal abilities of the
  whales? Together with the NWO they have made various attempts at
  communication, with mixed results. Today they are fairly certain
  that dolphins are not as intelligent as humans but might provide
  a useful partner for exploration (some gengineers have suggested
  bringing dolphins to full human intelligence, but so far this has
  not been approved).
  </p>
  <p>
   The New World Order does not care for the oceans in a physical
  way, they are just a lot of water. But they also provide cover;
  just about anything could be hidden down there. The nuclear
  submarines developed during the cold war provided an interesting
  way to study the psychology of small, closed communities, and NWO
  sociologists are quite interested in the ideas for underwater
  colonies.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Syndicate is so far not very interested in the depths
  except for their mineral resources. Their main interest in the
  sea is simply shipping. And maybe for disposing their
  enemies.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Traditions and the Oceans
  </h2>
  A bit surprising, the
  Traditions have never truly explored the oceans, perhaps because
  they are more interested in the beliefs and powers of the
  land-dwellers.
  <p>
   Coastal Verbena (sometimes called the People of the Mists) are
  probably the most knowledgeable tradition mages when it comes to
  marine secrets. In many fishing villages the old superstitions
  still survive, and fishermen rely on the skills of the wise
  people to ensure good weather, bountiful catches and safety.
  Marine Verbena has learned to speak with the denizens of the
  deep, to intercede with the spirits of the waves and divine the
  weather, often using very different methods than their inland
  cousins.
  </p>
  <p>
   Most other traditions have very little to do with the sea. To
  most of the high mages of the Order of Hermes and Celestial
  Chorus the sea is just an abstraction, a symbol for the
  subconscious or primal. The Cult of Ecstasy might enjoy cruising
  in the Caribbean or diving in tropical waters, but that¹s
  it. The Sons of Ether have a certain fascination for conquering
  the sea, and a few etherites build more or less bizarre
  exploration crafts.
  </p>
  <h2>
   <a name="ARS1">
    Abyssal Research Station One
   </a>
  </h2>
  This is a
  Technocracy construct located on the abyssal plains in the West
  European Basin, around 1200 kilometres west of France at a depth
  of 6637 meters. Its main purpose is oceanographic study of the
  north-eastern Atlantic, the development and testing of new
  underwater crafts, and research into geothermal energy. It is
  manned by 100 people, making it one of the largest undersea
  constructs. Much of the research is done from mobile research
  stations (or workshacks as the Void Engineers call them) which
  are towed to their work areas from the main station.
  <p>
   At the construct there are four research teams: Team Blue,
  which is a Oceanographer team devoted to surveying the
  north-eastern Atlantic, Team Green, which is a
  Progenitor/Oceanographer team studying deep sea biology, Team
  Red, which is an Iteration X/Oceanographer team testing new
  submarine crafts, and Team Yellow, which is an Iteration X team
  studying geothermal energy. Each team is led by a coordinator
  (Team Blue and Green are rather democratic, while Team Yellow and
  Red have a fixed command structure), and the coordinators work
  together with the station manager as a ruling council.
  </p>
  <p>
   The construct is built out of cylindrical modules, 15 meters
  across and 20 meters high, which are linked together into a
  hexagonal pattern by airlocks. Currently there are ten such
  modules at the main construct, and two modules which are used as
  workshacks (one near the mid-Atlantic ridge where Team Yellow
  drills for geothermal energy, the other around 100 kilometres to
  the north where parts of Team Blue are doing studies of the
  Gauntlet). The outside is covered with searchlights, airlocks,
  girders and large tanks. The interiors are cramped and have a
  distinct submarine feel despite the best efforts (?) from the
  Iteration X designers. Outside the ocean floor forms an infinite
  reddish-grey plain, strewn with the occasional boulder and
  instrument package.
  </p>
  <p>
   So far the research station has done well. It has mapped a
  large portion of the seafloor, catalogued the life in the area
  and begun some serious work on geothermics, although the last
  project have been somewhat hampered by unexplained equipment
  failures (Team Yellow is has noted some incidences of reality
  instability near the midatlantic ridge, but so far the matter has
  not been studied well enough). There is even talk about adding
  two modules more to the station to house a fifth research team to
  study deep ocean mining. However, the station manager Gordon
  Westing (A graduate from the Ivory Tower) is secretly worried
  that something is amiss. It could be his usual paranoia, but he
  is certain that there is something out there watching the
  station. He has stepped up the security measures just in case,
  and have scattered secret sensor packages over the ocean
  floor.
  </p>
  <h2>
   <a name="PRO">
    Proteus 5
   </a>
  </h2>
  This is a Son of Ether
  exploration craft/chantry, built by the Gerault brothers (a pair
  of quite successful French Son of Ether engineers). It looks like
  mixture between an immense tank, a submarine and a building,
  which is quite close to the truth. It has immense MHD propulsion
  units which can drive it forward in the sea (although it is quite
  slow and hard to steer) and threads allowing it to crawl along
  the ocean floor. Its armoured hull (made out of a black alloy
  originally devised by Jules Verne) can withstand immense
  pressures and most forms of attack. On the top there is a pyramid
  of windows (made out of a similarly strong transparent material
  which can also be covered with armoured sheets) which allows the
  crew to look out. In addition the Proteus is armed by two big
  electromagnetic cannons, able to send electrical discharges
  through the water against an enemy.
  <p>
   The whole construction requires a crew of two to function, but
  there is room for another 10 persons (although it will be
  extremely cramped). The interior is decorated in a mixture of
  industrial romanticism (lots of bulkheads, pipes and decorative
  cast-iron statues) and futurism (abstract paintings of machines,
  chromed instruments and slashes of red, white and black). The
  laboratory forms the central room, with the pyramid windows
  allowing 360 degree vision of the sea (which can be lit by
  immense searchlights or bio-fluorescent radiation). Around it are
  crew quarters, the control room, a small pantry and the airlocks.
  Beneath this level is the machinery, powered by a ether
  generator.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Gerault brothers travel around the world, exploring the
  oceans, sometimes sabotaging Technocracy activities like Captain
  Nemo did (it is rather obvious to anyone who has met them that
  they have read far too much Jules Verne). They are not
  particularly interested in ecology, and don't think twice about
  blowing up oil tankers if they get the chance (fortunately the
  range of the cannons is somewhat limited). Recently they have
  begun to become more and more obsessed with finding out what is
  going on in the real depths, exploring the deepest trenches. What
  they might find there could destroy them.
  </p>
  <h2>
   <a name="CLEAR">
    The Clearwater Institute
   </a>
  </h2>
  The
  Clearwater Institute was founded in 1971 by Janosh Kazensky, a
  Polish-German industrialist and philanthropist quite interested
  in oceanography and ecology. Its purpose is to "study the ocean
  and the life therein, and find ways for the oceanic biosphere to
  co-exist with mankind". So far it has spent a great deal of
  energy tracking down sources of pollution, developing new ways to
  clean water (which incidentally have brought in a lot of new
  money) and several ingenious methods of measuring the health of
  marine organisms. Its research stations are spread world-wide,
  especially in the tropics and near the polluted rivers of Europe.
  <p>
   One of the lesser known projects is about dolphin
  communication. The institute owns the research vessel Delphinus
  2, which it uses to meet the dolphins in their own environment
  and record their sounds. The ship is filled with advanced
  computers used to build databases of dolphin sounds and
  behaviour, applying sophisticated cryptographic algorithms to
  understand them. On staff are two biologists, a linguist and a
  cryptographer. One technique they have experimented with is
  leaving hidden recorders in the sea to listen when no humans are
  around. So far the project has yielded some intriguing
  information about the social life of the dolphins and a lot of
  data about their migrations.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the project is slowly moving towards a revelation.
  Within the computer memory are some songs which should never have
  been recorded by humans. If they are cracked by the team, the
  communications barrier will be broken. But they will also learn
  some secrets the dolphins would never have revealed voluntarily,
  and will do *anything* to keep secret. Anything.
  </p>
  <h2>
   <a name="STORIES">
    Story Ideas
   </a>
  </h2>
  The ocean represents
  the primal unknown, the collective unconscious, the watery womb
  of reality. In its depths everything is born, and everything
  sooner or later returns to its darkness to be reborn or
  dissolved. Stories involving the ocean always have elements of
  mystery and primordial myths; civilisation, technology, even
  mages, all are powerless against its might.
  <h3>
   Vendetta
  </h3>
  Proteus accidentally encounter the Abyssal
  Research Station One. The Gerault brothers jump to the chance of
  wreaking havoc, and the technomancers will strike back with all
  their underwater might. The ensuing battle will take place in
  darkness and cold, where the enemy can strike from anywhere and
  vanish into the darkness again. The PCs could either be
  technomancers desperately trying to defend the construct from
  unseen attackers, or tradition mages onboard the Proteus. In the
  latter case the construct is not the only danger, as the Gerault
  brothers are slowly slipping into insanity and Quiet fighting
  their enemies. This could be a underwater techno-thriller like
  "The Abyss" or "DeepStar 6", or a darker tale about destruction
  and unreasoning hatred.
  <h3>
   Exploration
  </h3>
  The mages are exploring a coral reef where
  they have indications a powerful node lies hidden inside a
  underwater cave. What kinds of beings live there? During the day
  the reef may be an exotic but beautiful place, but what about in
  the night? This gives the ST a chance to explore the weird and
  wonderful world of underwater life, but also the gritty and
  dangerous problems with scuba gear, wet suits and unknown
  currents.
  <h3>
   The Thing From The Depths
  </h3>
  After a storm the PCs find an
  unusual object washed ashore, completely different from anything
  they ever have seen. The most sensitive of the PCs start having
  unsettling dreams and visions, all relating to the sea and its
  dark mysteries. Something down there draws them towards it, but
  what? And why does people who rely on Dream suddenly behave so
  strangely, almost as if *something* was influencing their
  actions? Is something awakening that should sleep forever, or is
  this the beginning of a new era? This story could be a horror
  story a la Lovecraft, or a modern myth about the subconscious.
  <h3>
   The Island
  </h3>
  For some reason (maybe searching for a lost
  tome, following a vision or fleeing from the Technocracy) the PCs
  arrive at an isolated island somewhere in the north sea,
  constantly surrounded by fog and seabirds, yet strangely silent.
  The inhabitants seem to be all gone without a trace from their
  homes, except for the sullen keeper of the lighthouse who just
  tells then to mind their own business. If pressed he just answers
  that the sea took the others. There is no doubt that there is
  something out there, and it definitely has something to do with
  the reason for the visit of the PCs. This story could be anything
  from a detective story in an unusual setting to a symbolic quest
  for Ascension.
