  <hr>
   Dorothy Symms was a promising member of Order of Hermes, very
  devoted to linguistic research. Her initiation took place under a
  powerful conjunction between Mercury, the Sun and the Moon in
  Aquarius, making her mentors to expect much from her. She
  fulfilled their expectations admirably, unearthing hereto unknown
  secrets about the structure of Language itself, and how this
  structure reflects reality around us. While some mages was a bit
  worried at her liberal use of psychological terms from the
  Technocracy and her quite radical theories about the nature of
  language, most hermetics were deeply impressed and tended to
  regard her more outr√© concepts as just youthful folly.
   <p>
    After a writing her magnum opus "De Lingua Arcana", a well
  known tome about the magickal languages of humanity, she began to
  study nonhuman languages. At first she communicated with
  dolphins, dogs and cats, and later she began experimenting with
  insects. After becoming convinced that there existed some kind of
  underlying language common for all beings, she began to study
  Spirit with zeal. She started to travel into the Umbra, trying to
  communicate with the entities out there. On one of her
  expeditions she disappeared, and is generally considered
  dead.
   </p>
   <p>
    Actually she was contacted by something, a kind of entity
  completely alien to normal reality. These entities take the form
  of strings of symbols or sentences. In effect, they are living
  language. To fulfil their potential, they must use intelligent
  minds. They reproduce by spreading themselves to other minds, but
  unlike ordinary beings their progeny isn't similar to themselves,
  at least not in any obvious way. It is hard to say if two
  different sentences are different entities or different
  representations of the same entity.
   </p>
   <p>
    Dorothy's mind is filled with these entities, and she is only
  partially human today. When she talks she will often suddenly say
  complete nonsense, jumbled or meaningless words. The really
  spooky thing is that people who listens to her often themselves
  begins to talk like her as the entities enter their minds.
  Fortunately the entities cannot survive for long outside a mind
  with the right environment for them, so this is temporary.
  Dorothy is their servant, vehicle and home. It is possible that
  she only behaves normally, that her mind has merged with the
  strange linguistic life that inhabits her. When she talks, it is
  a society of alien beings that speaks (she have started to use
  "We" instead of "I").
   </p>
   <p>
    The entities goals are inscrutable. Human standards are not
  applicable to these beings, since they are too alien. To some
  extent, they seems to be interested in spreading themselves into
  more minds, but they also seems to be just curious about reality.
  But they also seems to do certain very specific actions, which
  seems to have some purpose. All in all, they are frighteningly
  unpredictable.
   </p>
   <p>
    The linguistic entities are constantly trying to spread from
  Dorothy's mind, perhaps involuntarily. When she speaks or writes
  nonsense, entities are trying to spread into other minds. A text
  written by her will contain encoded entities, and when someone
  reads it the entities will enter his mind. But the entities
  fortunately seems to require a very special type of mind to
  inhabit, since they cannot exist long in a normal mind. But
  Dorothy is doing her best to supply the entities with more
  suitable minds. If a person is subjected to the entities for a
  long time, they will start to modify its pathways and make it
  more hospitable. A knowledge of linguistics or expression seems
  to make entry much easier, so she have mainly tried to infect
  linguists or artists.
   </p>
   <p>
    But the entities seems to be bent on spreading far and wide.
  They seems to want to spread themselves using mass media, slowly
  reforming the minds of humanity into suitable homes. To this end,
  Dorothy is trying to spread them into advertisements, television
  scripts and by converting people involved with mass media.
   </p>
   <p>
    The entities seems to be interested in different aspects of
  reality. They are fascinated by the idea of space. Dorothy and
  her acolytes can spend hours just looking and feeling at an
  object, delighting in its shape and three-dimensionally. Dorothy
  tends to become awed by large things, and often spends much time
  looking at buildings. However, this awe is not apparently
  emotional, just an intense (sometimes dangerous) curiosity. The
  victim just must understand a spatial relationship, and can look
  at it from every conceivable angle. Interestingly enough, the
  entities find the mind of anyone with Correspondence abhorrent,
  and refuse to inhabit it.
   </p>
   <p>
    The entities sometimes seem to perform certain actions, as if
  they were parts of a great plan or perhaps magickal ritual.
  Suddenly Dorothy will stand up and start to make complex gestures
  in silence. Her acolytes will sometimes rush out to straight to a
  certain place, stand there and wait. After a while they will walk
  back. Some acolytes buy ordinary goods like toys, food or
  furniture, look them over, paint symbols on them and then put
  them at specific places or give them away. Perhaps this makes
  sense to the entities, who after all are living in a radically
  different universe than us.

   Dorothy is a likeable lady, and generally spread a feeling

  and ideas, she would be the perfect grandmother. She has a
  tendency to start to enthusiastically talk about deep questions
  in linguistics, magick and philosophy while serving tea and
  biscuits, sometimes interrupted by sudden non sequiturs and
  nonsense.

   Language (all spheres): She seems to use

  entities (which may help her magick). She don't use the Seal very
  much anymore (due to high Arete).
   <p>
    Her countermagick against Mind is a bit special. All attempts
  to contact her mind will automatically succeed, but the other
  mage will be subjected to the entities and their magick directly.
  Is someone is trying to attack the entities inside her, both her
  countermagick and the entities countermagick will resist it,
  making it extremely hard to influence them.

    "Have you read about the deep-structure theory
  about language? If the proponents of nimiziddimiddi are right,
  there exist the same language-structures kokkallareb umutzin
  somewhere in the mind of all of us. These structures reflect, and
  are reflected in, the structure of reality around us. Sandbag in
  Andes order of heroes, fry fire get green. In effect, Prime flows
  along linguistic patterns. We think we have some evidence of
  this."
   </p>
   <h2>
    The Acolytes
   </h2>
   Dorothy's acolytes are all intelligent
  people with a background in linguistics, art, media or magick.
  They are on the surface quite normal, but sometimes tend to talk
  nonsense like Dorothy. They can be quite disturbing sometimes, as
  they suddenly start to babble incoherently. This has been a
  problem for several of them, but most of them can interact
  normally with society.
   <p>
    Dorothy and her acolytes (or rather, the entities in their
  minds) keep in touch using phone, mail and e-mail. They also
  actively seek to spread the entities, often using subtle means.
  One acolyte, a psychologist, is using entity-infested nonsense in
  his studies of memory, where participants try to learn
  meaningless information (and thus become infected). Another
  acolyte, a painter, paints entities into his paintings.
   </p>
   <p>
    The acolytes like Dorothy, and are quite controlled by the
  entities, but would not really die for her. At least their human
  parts would not sacrifice themselves, but the entities have
  somewhat different standards. An entity which has spread does not
  care whether a few copies are destroyed, as long as other copies
  remain. That may lead to that the entities sacrifice the acolytes
  or Dorothy in a crisis.
   </p>
   <h2>
    The Entities
   </h2>
   The Entities do not have any physical or
  mental traits. They are not even beings in any sense, just
  information. They can however work magick when they are in
  contact with a linguistic system (generally a mind, but certain
  computer systems could be influenced). If anybody hears an entity
  as a sentence, read an encoded entity or think about it, it can
  make magickal effects against the mind of the victim. These
  effects are completely alien in nature and form. Most are felt as
  sudden weird thoughts and visions. They are generally in the form
  of weird hallucinations, utterly strange but hardly impossible.
  The effects are purely mental, and have no physical effect in any
  way. A mage with Mind will immediately realize that he is
  subjected to magick, but since the magick is from the "inside",
  countermagick is not possible (or rather, it is impossible to
  tell if it was successful or not).
   <p>
    A typical example is when someone reads a text written by
  Dorothy, he will suddenly glimpse a vision of the shape of
  grammar and believe the thought "Pyramids are handout into groan"
  for a moment. Afterwards, he will have flashbacks every time he
  sees aeroplanes. A mage will realize that some kind of mental
  magick or other strange effect has taken place, but will be
  unable to identify the source (since the magickal act was done by
  the interpretation of the entity inside his own mind.)
   </p>
   <p>
    Note that if an entity is part of text, it will do almost the
  same thing when it is read again. Some entities seems to be
  created solely for the purpose to do some magickal effects. And
  remember, it is practically impossible not to read a visible
  text!
   </p>
   <p>
    Generally, the collective of entities in Dorothy's mind have
  an effective Arete 5 for countermagick. They have Mind 5. The
  entities in her acolytes have Arete 4 and Mind 4. The transient
  entities of other people have Arete 1-2, and equal Mind.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Entity Rotes
   </h3>
   [These are not really rotes in the ordinary
  sense. The entities
   <em>
    are
   </em>
   the sentences and magick they
  perform. It can even be discussed if they really do magick, or
  just play with the minds of their victims like ordinary sentences
  do on a smaller scale. Each time one of these rotes succeed, the
  difficulty for that rote is lowered one step.]
   <p>
    <b>
     Suggestion (Mind 2):
    </b>
    The victim will be suggested to do
  something, either now or when triggered by some stimuli. Often
  these suggestions are quite weird, and serve no apparent purpose
  (like yelling "Hehro fy!" each time the victim sees a cab, or
  trying to throw apples at a certain television show). This is
  used to condition the mind of the victim slightly to the presence
  of entities.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Hallucination (Mind 3):
    </b>
    The victim will see some kind
  of weird hallucination, often with synestetic elements (the
  victim hear colors, see the taste of space or feel the shape of
  grammar). This is used by entities to modify the mind of the
  victim slightly, so that they will be able to exist in it
  longer.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Take Control (Mind 4):
    </b>
    The entity can take control over
  parts or the whole of the mind of the victim, and start to
  control his thoughts and behavior. When a entity manages to do
  this, it will remain in control as long as the duration of the
  effect. After that time, the entity will dissolve since the mind
  of the victim is unsuitable. If it manages to get five successes,
  it is permanent.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Story Idea:
   </h3>
   One of the players (or a friend of them) sees
  an advertisement in a paper and becomes infested with entities.
  Tracking the infection backwards, they find an acolyte who is
  busy spreading entities through the papers. From the acolyte that
  can find out about Dorothy, and perhaps meet her. What to do with
  her is another question.
   <p>
    To complicate things further, the Technocracy may become
  interested in the case. The Syndicate will certainly note if some
  of their pawns start to talk nonsense, and want to stop further
  spread. The New World Order and Void Engineers would become
  interested in learning more about the entities, perhaps to use
  them for their own purposes.
   </p>
   <p>
    Note that Dorothy hardly is the "servant of Nameless Things
  from the Outer Darkness" the players will expect. She is a nice
  lady, who serves tea and biscuits while her language is trying to
  take control over their minds.
