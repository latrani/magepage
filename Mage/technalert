Stimulus and Response:
 
A System for Determining the Reactions of the Technocracy
 
 
 
Some Tradition mages believe that the Technocracy knows all and sees all, 
that it monitors everything everywhere in the world, and responds as it 
sees fit.  This is an exaggeration, but the Technocracy does check for 
supernatural activity in many different venues.  The following rules are 
to help determine exactly what the Technocracy does and does not see, and 
how it responds.
 
 
 
Monitoring Priority
 
Even the Technocracy has limited resources, so it prioritizes what is 
does and does not monitor.  The priority system ranges from 2 to 10, from 
the most vital Technomancer installations, to completely unknown areas 
like the Deep Umbra.  It is rumored that priority 1 sites exist as well, 
but no one other than the innermost circle of Technomancers knows for 
certain.
 
Priority Level
1   ???
2   The most fundamental Technomancer installations or people
3   An important Technomancer installation or leader (Masters)
4   A typical Technomancer installation, a vitally important mundane 
    person (such as the President of the United States), or advanced 
    (Adept level) Technomancers
5   A minor Technomancer installation, or very important mundane person 
    or place (corporate research centers, US Senators and Governors), 
    low level Technomancers or high level Technocratic servants
6   Important mundane places (government offices, science labs, or a
    corporate headquarters), low level Technocratic servants
7   Public areas in major cities.
8   Most cities and towns.
9   Rural areas.
10  Deep wilderness.
 
Note:  You may assume that the Penumbra is being observed at a Priority 
Level one higher than the nearby physical area.  That is, the Umbra 
nearby an minor Technocracy installation is being monitored by Void 
Engineer equipment at a Priority Level of 6.
 
 
 
Activity Level
 
The amount of supernatural activity is another factor in determining 
whether or not the Technocracy notices a particular incident.  Activity 
Level is also rated from 1 to 10.
 
1   Simple observation
2   Minor trespassing or conversation
3   Threatening but non-violent interaction, or evidence of sensory 
    magick
4   Mundane violence, evidence of coincidental magick, or slight 
    supernatural activity
5   Extreme levels of mundane violence, non-threatening vulgar magick, 
    hostile coincidental magick, or significant supernatural activity
6   Multiple castings of vulgar magick, hostile vulgar magick, or major 
    supernatural activity
7   Multiple castings of hostile vulgar magick, a single large vulgar 
    effect (like opening a node), or extreme supernatural activity
8   Massive and invasive workings of vulgar magick or warpings of 
    reality
9   Full fledged reality invasions from the Umbra
10  Immediate and dire threats to reality itself
 
Note:  Add 1 to 3 to the Activity Level for actions that are repeated.
 
 
 
Technocracy Response Time
 
To determine whether or not the Technocracy responds to a particular 
incident, roll a number of dice equal to the Activity Level against a 
difficulty rating equal the Priority Level.  The number of successes will 
determine how quickly the Technocracy responds.
 
Successes
0   No response.
1   The incident is recorded, but there is no further investigation, 
    unless there are additional related incidents.
2   The incident is noted, but not until several days after the fact.
3   A monitoring flag is thrown, and the event will be noticed within a 
    few hours.
4   The activity is overt enough that there's a response within minutes.
5   Nearly immediate response.
 
For example, if someone tries to steal supplies (Activity Level 3) from 
minor Technocratic construct (Priority Level 5), roll 3 dice with a 
difficulty level of 5 to determine whether it was noticed or not.
 
If a mage mind controls (hostile coincidental magick - Activity Level 5) 
a banker into giving him money (Priority Level 7), roll 5 dice with a 
difficulty of 7.  If a 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10 are rolled, some servant of the 
Technocracy will check into the incident within a few days.  If the mage 
tries this trick several times in a row, the Level of Activity will go up 
(and the Priority Level may go down).
 
 
 
Response Level
 
To determine how the Technocracy responds to an incident, roll dice equal 
to the Activity Level again, with the following difficulty:
 
4   Nephandi, Marauder or Virtual Adept involvement suspected.
5   The Technocracy itself is the target of the activity.
6   The event threatens Sleepers.
7   The incident involves no mages.
8   The incident is a conflict between supernaturals only, that seems 
    not to threaten Sleepers or the Technocracy.
9   The incident does not involve any supernatural creatures.
 
Add +2 to the difficulty if the event was not noticed until several days 
later.  The number of successes determine how much force the Technocracy 
will bring to bear on the situation.
 
Successes
0   Deemed unthreatening.  Monitored only.
1   Mundane investigators sent.
2   Well armed but otherwise mundane operatives sent.
3   Enhanced operatives (MIB, Hit Marks, etc.) sent.
4   Enhanced operatives accompanied by several Technomages or one or 
    more pieces of heavy equipment
5   Full fledged assault force, including numerous enhanced operatives, 
    multiple Technomancers and large equipment (such as high-tech tanks 
    or helicopters and advanced weapons).
 
 
 
Foiling Technocratic Observation
 
Many tradition mages make an effort to cloak their activities from the 
eyes of the Technocracy.  Increase the difficulty for the detection roll 
by +1 to +3, depending on how effective the mages are at masking their 
actions.  A mage may add half their Arcane rating to the difficulty, in 
place of (not in addition to) other precautions.
 
Note that using magick to cloak the activity of an otherwise mundane task 
can be self defeating.  If a mage wants to steal something (Activity 
Level 3), he can cloak his actions with invisibility and raise the 
difficulty of detection by a point or two.  However, his level of 
Activity is raised to 5 for the use of vulgar magick, meaning more dice 
are rolled to detect him, and any response is likely to be more severe.
 
Mages may also try to "draw out" Technocratic forces with some sort of 
diversion prior to any major activity.  At the Storytellers discretion, 
response teams might be committed to investigate the diversion, and are 
therefore unavailable to deal with the true assault.
