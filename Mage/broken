...and I'll break all your stereotypes for $49.95.




The Akashic Brother video game junky...yeah...you've seen this guy...
he's 14...he beat "Mortal Kombat 3" the first day it was out...he knows
the secret codes to every Nintendo game ever made...he annoys the
Virtual Adepts because he can beat everything they design for him that's
even remotely fair..."The machine doesn't care about you or what kind of
day you've had or any of your problems...anything you see on the screen
is what you've brought to the game...anything you get out of the game
you get out of yourself."...he's always in the 'zone' in pinball where
you simply _can't mess up_ even though you've won 15 free games and the
place is about to close...Ascencion on "Asteroids"...He's got the Nine
Lives Merit, but he's only got Three...His special Do move is leaping onto
people's heads...

The Verbena schoolteacher...she's in her mid-forties...she's frumpy...
she wears flowerdy dresses and plastic glasses...she teaches primary
grades...she's incredibly popular with the kids, the parents and the
school..."Life isn't in books, in test tubes, or in smearing animals
over some tree out in the forest.  It's right beneath the skin of these
seven-year olds, and they shout it out through their mouths."...no pagan
agenda...a very balanced view of science...the good and the bad...a very
balanced view of nature...the good...a unit on "Our Friends the Plants"...
kids come home from school: "We talked to a bird in school today, Mom."
"That's nice, dear."...long-term paradigm warrior...looking past her lifetime
..."This kind of work isn't going to accomplish a single thing, while I'm
alive.  Maybe next time around I'll see something of the results."

The Order of Hermes debunker...the Technocracy's worst nightmare...a
Hermetic that's on their side...There's no psychics...there's no UFOs...
there's no vampires...there's no mages...there's nothing supernatural
at all...targeting the Sleeper fakes...the Technocracy is paralyzed: can't
work against him without shooting themselves in the foot...building up
for a worldwide blow-the-top-off-your-paradigm explosion and retaliation...
and there's nothing they can do about it...


The Celestian Chorus sleazy televangelist politician...Pat Robertson on
crack...the Traditions half-wish he would roll up and die...but darnit,
there's just something appealing about hundreds of screaming Sleepers
carrying signs like "Death To The Godless Secular Conspiracy" and
"John 3:16" lying down in front of NWO officials' cars and smashing the
windows and getting a little crazy and killing a few...a massive fanatical
army...taking the Technocracy's "conservative" viewpoint and giving it
teeth, claws and a bad attitude...shrieking fights at conclaves over
whether to stop him or encourage him...his face on every billboard...
headlines across the nation...Phill Collins sings "Jesus He Knows Me"...

The Virtual Adept roleplaying game designer...hey, he's designing a new
world, right?...one inside people's heads?...absolutely, 100%...computers
can't be as complicated as the human brain and they can't be as creative...
a savagely weird NPC..."Over The Edge" plots anyone?


More to come....
