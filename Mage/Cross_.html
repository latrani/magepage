    Spoiler alert: This character and story is taken directly
  from the novel Dark Matter by Garfield Reeves-Stevens. It is a
  very good book, with many ideas useful for Mage, which I heartily
  recommend. However, the following text contains lots of spoilers,
  so do not read it if you don't want to spoil your fun.

   Dr. Anthony Cross is probably one of the most
  dangerous marauders on Earth today. Dr Cross is a genius. He is
  also quite insane. He is hunted by the desperate Technomancers
  who unleashed him, and anybody coming into their path is risking
  his life.
   <p>
    Cross' childhood was traumatic. He was an isolated child
  prodigy, with no support from his single mother. She and her
  lovers beat him up repeatedly, and he spent most of his time
  reading and playing mental games to flee from the harsh reality.
  He learned how to take apart his toys to learn how they worked,
  and he repaired them when they didn't work already when he was
  four. Later, he vivisected two cats to learn how they worked and
  why one of them was sick. When he was five he took apart his
  mother and her lover to see how they worked and why they were
  bad.
   </p>
   <p>
    He had already learned how to hide his real feelings and
  thoughts, and he made the psychiatrists proclaim him cured, and
  he was adopted by a new family. The old records were sealed. Here
  he got encouragement, love and a good material standard. He
  became known as a prodigy, and he devoured the endless supply of
  books and teaching he got in a record time. When he was 11, he
  began to study at Harvard. At about the same time, his foster
  parents tragically died in a car accident. Nobody suspected that
  the apparently grief-stricken Cross had sabotaged the brakes,
  since he felt that his foster parents no longer were useful.
   </p>
   <p>
    His scientific career became exceptional. When he discovered
  the Cross Correlate to Bells Theorem (for which he and his
  research team won the Nobel Price), the Void Engineers became
  interested. He had found a loophole in their theories, and had
  neatly removed it. The result was elegant, useful and completely
  consistent. The Engineers quickly realized that Cross was at
  least partially awakened, and definitely a first rank genius.
  Unfortunately he was far too unstable to be allowed to join them,
  so they decided together with the New World Order to place him in
  a safe environment, where he could continue his research (subtly
  manipulated by the Engineers) while the Technocracy could keep
  him in control. The persuaded him to work at SHARP, Shannon
  Facility for Advanced Research in Physics, a think tank
  officially controlled by Shannon Industries, located in Los
  Angeles.
   </p>
   <p>
    At first, everything seemed to work fine. The Technocracy
  carefully kept the lid on Cross' "Inspirational Murders", and he
  rewarded them with more interesting results. He refined his
  theories using the mini-accelerator at SHARP and its
  supercomputers. But what the Engineers didn't realize was that he
  was creating new theories too, much more advanced. He was
  pursuing his own Grand Unified Theory of Quantum Gravitation.
  When he first demonstrated how he could create a vortex of
  relativistic electrons which could bend a laser beam somewhat
  with its gravitation, the technomancers became at first
  enthusiastic, until they began to realize the implications. Cross
  had found a big bug in their theories. Or had he created one?
  They realized that they had to find out, regardless of the
  price.
   </p>
   <p>
    By now Cross had advanced his theories immensely. Another
  demonstration destroyed the accelerator and nearly created a
  black hole. It was clearly a Paradox effect. But the worst thing
  was what the technomancers found in the accelerator, a dead cat
  connected to it with complex copper wires. They began to realize
  that they had lost control over Cross and that he had become a
  rogue Son of Ether, at least in some aspects. But before they had
  the time to act, Cross demonstrated his new theories. He
  demonstrated how he, with the help of some utterly weird
  technology, could create and manipulate the quantum fields. In
  essence, he could manipulate the basis of existence. After the
  demonstration, which killed several people, he just
  disappeared.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Technocracy was furious and terrified. Cross was on the
  loose, using his knowledge and power completely as he wished.
  They decided he had to be stopped by any means. While Cross
  travelled across the nation looking for the Beginning, the New
  World Order planned an ambush at Harvard, where their experts
  were certain he would appear sooner or later. They were right. At
  least ten students were killed, and twice as many Men In Black.
  The technomancers found out that Cross no longer needed his
  gadgets, and could project quantum fields as he wanted. He was
  also almost impossible to terminate. He left them and
  disappeared.
   </p>
   <p>
    Today the Technocracy is doing its best to track him down. He
  is extremely dangerous, both to consensus reality and to anybody
  in the vicinity. What makes him even more scary is that he is
  advancing
    <em>
     fast
    </em>
    . He seems to learn more and more about
  the universe every day, and has already understood far too much
  about the metaphysics of magick. Of course, he doesn't view his
  methods as magick, or even science for that matter. He just
    <em>
     knows
    </em>
    how things fit together, and he knows that he soon
  will understand both the Beginning and the End.
   </p>
   <p>
    Cross is a genius, and quite insane. But he is very good at
  hiding his insanity from most people. Most of his insanity is
  apparent in his long poetic reveries on the fundamental structure
  of reality, and his often quite eccentric jokes and theories. It
  is often quite hard to distinguish these two, and maybe there is
  no difference. Cross has an affinity for cats, who he often
  kidnap and kill, or use as "batteries" for certain experiments.
  He tends to view other people as empty shells whose only purpose
  is to help him understand. Sometimes he tries to explain what he
  is doing (often with much skill), and become very irritated if
  the listener don't understand him. It is not uncommon for him to
  demonstrate what he means quite graphically, which has cost many
  people their lives.

   He no longer uses foci for these spheres. Earlier he used
  Copper Wire for Forces and Prime, Cats for Prime and Electronics
  for Correspondence and Time. Whether he really needed them is
  unclear, but he sometimes uses them just for the fun of it.
   <p>
    Cross views the spheres in a quasi-scientific manner. He has
  realized that space and time is an illusion, merely a convenient
  ordering of events. He can simply reorder them. Matter and Forces
  are just the large scale fluctuations in the quantum fields,
  patterns which can be viewed in many ways. Cross can simply scoop
  up energy from the quantum foam. Finally, Prime is in his model
  the underlying quantum world, the true basis of reality. It can
  be manipulated by simply choosing what to observe or not. If
  Cross chooses to not observe something, it won't exist (Prime
  4).
   </p>
   <p>
    When Cross accumulates paradox, he will start to see reality
  more and more as a beautiful mesh of forces and mathematics. He
  will become caught in the beauty of it all, and try to impart it
  to others. He is also quite immune from paradox flaws and
  backlashes, which instead attack his surroundings. Usually they
  take the form of coincidental cases of physical mass destruction,
  like fires, gas explosions or electrical failures caused by
  technical failures. Cross is never hurt by these, and just
  happily wanders as the centre of the storm.

     Ally: Charis Neale
    </b>
    Charis was a graduate student when
  she met Cross on a research project in the Nevada desert, where
  they studied some of the properties of the fallout from early
  nuclear test sites. They became lovers, and Charis more or less
  adopted the brilliant but impractical scientist. She saw herself
  as his protector, and tried to protect him from academic intrigue
  and other problems. That suited him just fine. Her link to Cross
  is strong, and although she was at first horrified when she found
  out about the murders Cross had committed, she soon started to
  discreetly help him by giving him alibis, removing evidence and
  making sure nobody suspected him. Over the years she has learned
  more about him, and is probably the only human who has the
  slightest understanding of his mind.
   </p>
   <p>
    When the Technomancers employed Cross, she went with him. She
  became instrumental for the cover up of Cross' killings, and she
  tried to act as an intermediate between the technomancers and
  him. After his disappearance and the disastrous confrontation at
  Harvard, she escaped herself. Now she is searching for him,
  knowing that her fate is linked to his.

    <b>
     Destiny:
    </b>
    There is something strange with the rapid
  advancement of Cross. It is almost as if he was a natural force,
  quickly evolving towards something far above mere humanity. He
  has awakened and learned the spheres on his own, and now his
  Arete seems to increase at a frightening rate as he realizes more
  and more of the true nature of the universe. His destiny seems to
  be linked with extreme power, but also destruction.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Dream:
    </b>
    Cross gets his greatest inspirations through
  murder. Usually he spends some time befriending the victim, using
  his charm and attractive personality to gain the trust and often
  the love of him or her. Then he carefully immobilizes his victim,
  and using local anaesthetic surgically opens up their skulls
  while they are conscious. He carefully explains the problem that
  is bothering him, and finally plunges his hand into the living
  brain of the victim. In that moment of transition between life
  and death, Cross and the victim gain Understanding.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Talisman (Cross Gauntlet):
    </b>
    This is a gauntlet made of
  copper wires, meshed together in a complex network. The network
  seems to be random, but there is a hint of some underlying order
  in the patterns. It will fit uncomfortably tight to a forearm. At
  the elbow there is a bracelet-like connector, which connect to a
  circuit board with some electronics. A little blue light marks
  its state. When worn, it will react to the gestures of the
  wearer. At first, when the wearer makes a fist, the gauntlet will
  activate. It will shimmer, like it was behind some hot air, and
  then it will become completely black, darker than anything.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Gauntlet can make the hand of the wearer "slip through the
  mesh of the quantum", as Cross calls it. When in its black mode,
  it is completely immaterial and can pass through anything. The
  wearer can will it to become material again. This can be used as
  a dangerous weapon, if the gauntlet becomes material inside
  someone's body. The interference between the quantum fields will
  burn and destroy the tissues of the victim, while the wearer will
  be unharmed. It can also create interference on the quantum level
  creating electric discharges, and permit the manipulation of
  quantum mechanical processes. All in all, it is versatile and
  extremely dangerous to use. A final problem is how to turn it
  off. It is powered by the consciousness of the wearer, but when
  it is activated the "off-switch" become immaterial and cannot be
  reached by the hand. Cross apparently knew how to do it, but
  nobody has replicated it.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Prime 1:
    </b>
    Using the gauntlet, the wearer can feel the
  sea of quantum possibilities and the lattice of reality. Most
  users don't understand this power.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Forces 2:
    </b>
    It can manipulate light, mostly just
  absorbing it but it can also bend it around itself to become
  invisible.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Forces 3:
    </b>
    The gauntlet can create powerful electrical
  discharges by "scooping up the energy of quantum fluctuation".
  The user simply points it towards the target, and points.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Correspondence 4, Matter 3:
    </b>
    By "slipping through the
  lattice of reality" the user can move his hand through patterns
  as if it was absent. He can also make it material again, causing
  horrible damage to structures it appear inside due to quantum
  interference, or let it interact more carefully so it will not
  damage anything. For example, the user may reach into a sealed
  box and take out an object, rip the heart out of a person or make
  the hand material inside someone's head (quite fatal).
   </p>
   <p>
    Cross used the gauntlet instead of surgical procedures to gain
  inspiration from quite a few people, but now he no longer needs
  the talisman, and left it behind at the Harvard
  confrontation.

     Roleplaying tips:
    </b>
    You see everybody as empty shells
  created to help you learn the final secrets of the Beginning.
  They are amusing, simpleminded little creatures, and it is simple
  to fool them. Just act a bit shy and otherworldly, hide behind a
  facade of humor and charm. While they are quite predictable, it
  is sometimes interesting to manipulate them to test your theories
  of how they react.
   </p>
   <p>
    The important thing is to understand the Beginning. That
  elusive level below the Planck scale and time, where quantum
  reality and mind meld into something new, where matter and
  energy, space and time become one. To reach into the quantum,
  that is your destiny.

   <h2>
    Story ideas:
   </h2>
   The characters stumble upon Cross under his
  travels. He will appear to be both sane and an extremely powerful
  orphan. Cross will on the other hand become interested in the
  characters and want to learn their secrets and understand them.
  Can they survive the friendship of Cross, the pogrom of the
  Technocracy and his paradox backlashes? And if/when they realize
  the truth, what can they do?
   <p>
    The characters become involved with the murders Cross has
  committed. Somebody is covering them up for some reason. Can they
  find the real killer before it is too late? This could be set
  before Cross defects from the technocracy.
   </p>
   <p>
    Everybody hunts Cross. The technocracy and the traditions are
  united into an uneasy alliance to find Cross before he becomes
  too powerful and destructive. But they have different goals. Lots
  of mages just want to kill him. The Euthanatos wants to find out
  if he is eligible for the Good Death. Some mages want to learn
  his secrets. Some mages are intrigued by his extremely fast rise
  in power. Is he moving towards Oraclehood? And what if the
  marauders find him?
   </p>
   <p>
    What happened to the gauntlet and Neale after the Harvard
  incident? Perhaps she seeks out the characters to help her find
  Cross and protect her from the Technocracy. SoE characters would
  probably be very interested in the gauntlet, which can turn out
  to be very dangerous to both themselves and the surroundings.
