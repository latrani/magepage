  <h1>
   The Watcher
  </h1>

  <p>
   Harold was an unremarkable man. Although his friends and wife
  often told him he was both intelligent and perceptive, he never
  tried very hard to advance - he was content with being a minor
  bureaucrat in a large administration, hidden by his normality. As
  he slowly aged, not much happened - until one autumn day
  something unsettling began to occur. He was busy reading some
  unimportant documents when he found his gaze drifting away from
  the paper. He tried to look back, but somehow he couldn't control
  his eyes and found himself slowly rising above the his desk and
  his own slumped body beneath.
  </p>
  <p>
   As Harold gradually drifted away, he tried to call for help,
  to do something, but nothing happened. He rose through his
  ceiling into another cubicle where a meeting was in progress.
  Someone was just complaining about the taxes when Harold swept
  past. Nobody noticed. For over an hour Harold randomly moved
  through the building, seeing and hearing everything but unable to
  control anything. Then suddenly he felt a force pulling him back,
  and he awoke sitting in his chair. Shaken, he returned home
  secretly worrying that he was going mad.
  </p>
  <p>
   Several times the next months he found himself gliding away,
  sometimes during the night when he was lying in bed beside his
  dear wife, once even during a cab drive. He moved around, seeing
  things that he didn't understand and people who he didn't know.
  Gradually he began to see a pattern, a dirty game behind the
  scenes he had never suspected. There really existed conspiracies,
  and corruption was not just common, it was total. Shadowy
  characters manipulated the life of every man and woman.
  Frightened Harold began to realize that he either was completely
  out of his mind, hoplessly paranoid, or that he was living in a
  pure nightmare nobody else noticed or dared to notice. If he told
  anybody he knew he would be hospitalized - or worse.
  </p>
  <p>
   In desperation he tried to commit suicide. With trembling
  hands he swallowed what he calculated was a deadly dose of
  sedatives and leaned back in his sofa to await death. When he
  began to rise through the ceiling again he even felt a bit of
  bitter humor - for once it was proper and even expected. But this
  time he didn't drift around the city. Instead he drifted higher
  and higher above the world. He saw his city and the countryside
  around it. He saw other cities, other lands, other continents.
  And he saw every detail, everything that happened. It was as if
  he was an infinite eye watching the Earth from all directions at
  once. He had no individual existence, he was just the act of
  observing, of knowing.
  </p>
  <p>
   When Harold awoke in the hospital he didn't open his eyes. He
  already knew what was going on around him: the gossip among the
  nurses, the dying old woman five floors above slowly choking on
  her decaying lungs, the stressed young doctor about to make his
  first serious mistake. He let his attention float around in the
  building for a while, viewing it from many directions. He watched
  the pale man, in the intensive care unit dispassionatedly until
  he decided it was best to learn how to see through just two eyes
  again.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next weeks were somewhat confusing despite his new sense
  of clarity. He calmly watched his wife divorce him. He observed
  with some interest how he lost his job. Finally most of his old
  friends had walked away, apparently unsettled by his eerie gaze
  and strange mood. Harold watched it all from many angles to make
  sure he remembered, and then packed what he would need and walked
  away.
