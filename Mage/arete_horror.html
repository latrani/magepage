    Wisdom always has its price. Odin had to sacrifice
  his right eye in order to become the wisest among man and gods,
  and to learn the secret of the runes he had to sacrifice himself
  to himself. How great sacrifices are mages willing to do in order
  to perfect their understanding of the world?

      Alienation
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     As a mage becomes more and more powerful and enlightened, he
  will also become more alien and remote. The life of newly
  awakened mages is already beyond comprehension of mortals, and
  the visions and threats surrounding the Masters is equally
  incomprehensible to the lesser mages. They perceive the world on
  a far higher level than anybody else, but this understanding is
  impossible to explain to anybody who haven't reached it. This
  makes the behaviour of the Masters often appear as strangely
  pointless or downright confused, while the Masters are actually
  manipulating (or following) reality on a very high level. A
  riddle said at the exact right moment will grow in the minds of
  the listeners and make them understand the truth in a few years;
  a sudden gesture and the web of forces will reverberate across
  the universe.
    </p>
    <p>
     This makes enlightened mages somewhat hard to deal with for
  the unenlightened, and especially the sleepers. Most sleepers
  can't understand the problems, powers and limitations mages have,
  and the mages find the lives of sleepers dreary and limited. From
  their perspective, most sleepers are truly asleep, unaware and
  unthinking pawns for greater forces. The mages can see through
  their shallow personalities to their inner cores, where their
  real power lies untapped. Many mages (especially those skilled in
  Mind or Spirit) become so good at predicting how sleepers will
  behave that they hold no surprises to the mages.
    </p>
    <p class="c7">
     <span class="c6">
      Insanity
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     On the other hand, are the enlightened mages completely sane?
  Maybe they are not ascending, but becoming more and more insane;
  and since madness and inspiration on this level are impossible
  for lesser minds to distinguish, the Oracles may truly be stark
  raving mad. Are the Masters really seeing the true nature of the
  universe, or are they simply deluding themselves (and their
  students)? Nobody knows, not even the Masters.
    </p>
    <p>
     Most sleepers would regard mages as insane anyway, not only
  because of their ludicrous claims of being able to warp reality
  and their obviously silly conspiracy theories about the
  "Technocracy" (any psychiatrist could diagnose this as typical
  paranoid schizophrenia), but because they have outrageously
  bizarre ideas such as the existence of demons, that computers
  could become intelligent, that meditation can solve all the
  problems of the world or that the Earth once was the centre of
  the universe. Most people are disturbed by such unbalanced people
  and won't listen to them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many mages also fear insanity, especially in the form of
  Quiet. They have seen how Masters spend days quietly discussing
  philosophy with imagined people or fight their own
  hallucinations. They know that the line between madness and
  enlightenment is so fine, that it easily lost. Maybe that is what
  happened to the Marauders? Some mages try to control their own
  minds and perspective of the world rigorously, to prevent
  insanity from gaining foothold, but only succeed in avoiding
  enlightenment. The only way to ascend is to forget the notion
  that there is any difference between sanity and insanity.

      Traps
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Another danger on the Path is the many philosophical and
  practical traps and pitfalls which exist for mages. Beside such
  dangers as enemy mages, Paradox, the seduction of power and evil,
  madness and hubris there are other roadblocks on the path hidden
  within the teachings of the traditions. They are insidious,
  because they are intimately linked to the philosophies the mages
  encompass, and in order to circumvent them they must risk
  confronting the possibility that everything they so far has
  learned is false.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mages of the Akashic Brotherhood sometimes become so fixated
  on keeping harmony, that they become unable to develop further;
  any change would disturb the sacred pattern or change they
  embody, and thus they believe they are close to the truth. Some
  hermetic mages forget they are dealing with the real world and
  loose their path into clouds of abstractions, where truth is just
  another concept (this phase is sometimes called "The crossing of
  the Abyss of Daath"). Certain Euthanatos fall into the trap of
  carelessly killing anybody they perceived as having lost their
  possibilities in this incarnation, without listening to their
  intuition. And many Cultists of Ecstasy mistake hedonism for
  enlightenment.
    </p>
    <p>
     The traps and pitfalls on the path to Ascension do not end
  when the mage goes beyond the simple hinders of his tradition,
  instead they become more subtle. One problem many mages encounter
  is the imbalance between the inner and outer world. All
  sufficiently advanced mages know that there is no real difference
  between the mind and the physical world, both are mirrors of the
  other and if one changes the other will change too. Mystics
  decide to understand the totality of being by understanding and
  controlling their own minds and souls, while the Oracles decide
  to understand and control everything by total understanding of
  the outside world or even a small fragment of it (since all of
  existence also is reflected in each sphere). Both are completely,
  yet subtly, wrong as they slowly paint themselves into a corner.
  They loose the balance between inner and outer, and cannot move
  further until they realise this. But since they believe they are
  very close to total understanding, they usually continue to
  struggle in vain to gain the understanding they would easily get
  if the stopped struggling to find it.

      Potentiation
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     This is another problem with very enlightened mages, their
  actions become much more powerful and influential. It is hard to
  do something badly when you can do it well, and since they see
  deeper into reality and understands it better, their actions will
  have much more profound consequences than the same actions done
  by lesser mages. Usually they are much more controlled too, but
  that only means that they have the intended effect, not that the
  effect is good. A Master loosing his temper and cursing somebody
  will hurt him, and when a powerful mage decides to create
  something, that thing will be created regardless of the cost or
  consequences to the rest of reality. The mage is moving through
  reality (and breaking it) like wet tissue paper.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another problem is that the mage influences the reality around
  him very strongly; it resonates with his paradigm whatever it may
  be. Around an old and wise shaman the spirit world is much closer
  to reality, and the old signs retain their meaning. In the
  presence of one of the Cardinals of the Celestial Chorus,
  everyone feels the reality and power of the Divine. Not only does
  this enhance the magick of their tradition, it usually disrupts
  magick of other traditions or even consensus reality. And it also
  affects other parts of reality; technology tend to break down
  when confronted with the wild and dirty nature of the Verbena,
  and many sleepers (including some mages) unknowingly change their
  personalities just to fit in with the new reality. The most
  powerful mages change reality so much by simply perceiving it
  that the strain can erupt into Paradox; the Oracles would cause
  massive rifts in the Tapestry by simply watching static reality
  too closely.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another danger with this influence is that not only the
  conscious paradigm of the mage becomes real, but also his
  subconscious fears, psychoses and fantasies. A paranoid mage will
  influence reality around him so that he really will be hunted. A
  mage believing in the existence of Nephandi agents will create
  them. Depressed mages actually cause the world to become a greyer
  place. This is not just Quiet, but an actual warping of reality.
  Usually it will take some time for the influence to take effect,
  but sooner or later it will become real (or at least
  noticeable).

     <span class="c6">
      Beyond Good and Evil
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Another effect of enlightenment is that the mage sees beyond
  the ethics of lesser people, and start to understand the Big
  Picture. This can be rather chilling to others, as the Master
  apparently begins to become more and more amoral. In reality, he
  is just following a much higher ethics which the others cannot
  understand. Such a mage may break the arm of a student to make a
  point, knowing that the wound will be healed in a short time,
  while a very important lesson never will be forgotten. The pain,
  fear and surprise was just a part of the lesson, and he still
  have cordial feelings towards the student despite
  appearances.
    </p>
    <p>
     Other mages might appear completely ruthless in their quest
  for Ascension, since they know that Ascension is worth so
  infinitely much more than any finite amount of pain and
  suffering. And through their understanding of all possible
  realities, not even the most kind-hearted Master would hesitate
  one moment in choosing the less evil alternative. When an Oracle
  of Time offhandedly remarks that Holocaust was (will be?) a good
  thing, he really means it; of all possible histories he has seen,
  it was the least evil alternative and will in the end (after a
  few thousands of years?) become a source of a greater Good. This
  of course does nothing to reassure normal mages.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, part of this demoralisation may just be a gradual
  alienation from lesser beings. Mages are Nietzchean Overmen, able
  to see through all illusions, break down any hinder and create
  whatever worlds they want. But the most chilling thing is that
  they often are right.
    </p>
    <p class="c7">
     <span class="c6">
      The Death of the Ego
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     The final step is the ultimate sacrifice. The mage must be not
  only willing to sacrifice his power, his body, his mind, his soul
  and his individuality to Ascend, he actually has to do it. The
  final step towards Ascension is the death of the Ego, which will
  irrevocably vanish forever. Nobody knows what comes afterwards,
  or even if there is anything but Oblivion after the final step.
  This fills most mages with total fear, and many won't undertake
  the final step, instead proclaiming themselves as Ascended and
  perfected while they really are incomplete and filled with hidden
  fear of the unknown. Instead of dying, their egos grow and become
  perverted with power and understanding, until they are farther
  from Ascension than even the Sleepers. Only those who boldly dare
  to risk total annihilation can truly Ascend.
