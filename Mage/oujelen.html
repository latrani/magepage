   <h2>
    Short History
   </h2>
   Oujelitas (Seed of Tugej, Tric=E1pita,
  Numantinos, Oscuristas, etc.. .), an= d quite in disuse (The
  Oscuristas of the Ebro, The Order of Gelet or Geletianos)
   <p>
    From=20very past times the men that were inhabiting the Valley
  of the Ebro have adored to the demonstration of a concept, the
  cycle of the life and the death, for them the demonstration of
  this made is under the appearance of a Butterfly of three heads,
  that symbolizes change, and the cycle of the life and the
  death.
   </p>
   <p>
    The capital of that zone was the city of Numancia, Numancia
  supported to the Cartagineses, thus the priests of many cults
  that when time past formed the modern Order of Hermes forced to
  the Roman generals to besiege the city of Numancia, 133 a.c.
  since th ese were knowing of the acts that were happening on
  Numancia, facts that they considered a perversion.
   </p>
   <p>
    Numancia that at that time was populated by men of the ethnic
  of the Ilerguetes was destroyed by Roman troops in 133 AD, after
  a formidable site. The Numantinos could endure many days the
  isolation, but finally when the spirits began to weaken, and when
  the cannibalism was demoting them to beasts condition, preferred
  to accomplish a ritual (Baptism with Fire) before than been
  enslaved by the ones that hated Tugej.
   </p>
   <p>
    The few men and women that survived to the site and that were
  expelled of their capital let in their coming generations a
  feeling of hatred and death that the has followed until our days.
  After many years they created the city of (Ilerda) Lleida.
   </p>
   <p>
    But not all were successes, the Romans were converted to
  Christianity and the people of Lleida began to receive many
  pressures to let to enter the churches of Christ within their
  city. Finally ... the Tric=E1pita had to relinquish. In full
  Roman empire there was a Summo Sacerdo called Gelet that
  accomplished a series of transformations in the cult to Tugej,
  that they have changed forever its structure, therefore the cult
  that remained when the went toward Tugej, took his name, they
  were the Order of Gelet.=20 It is not known exactly what changes
  he accomplished because has not remained any witness of the cult
  before that date. What is known was their fled from Lleida toward
  the Pirineos, letting that the foreigners took the city, these
  entered Lleida, and the city was ransacked, violated women, dead
  men, destroyed churches, the Christians had been punished. After
  the men of Gelet, returned to a city in ruins, where soon
  returned to govern.
   </p>
   <p>
    But the Christians making Gallic of their stubbornness were
  not expulsed and the Geletianos had to live together with them,
  although knowing both groups who was ordering in the city. But
  the enemy was near. The Church hated the Geletianos by the
  perversion of their acts, and the Hermetical were fearing them by
  been intact within their territory. After a series of incidents
  in full Middle Ages the Order of Hermes declared Magi War on the
  Order of Gelet, after serious confrontations, the Geletianos
  returned (not without large losses on both sides) to be defeated,
  therefore the Idol that it was assaulted directly must flee in
  hands from the then Summo Sacerdo. Designated then by the
  Hermetical as The Wars of the Idol, they will be recalled all
  over the Geletia nos, to be in that moment when their Idol
  disappeared. The cult was decimated and the few that remained in
  life, soon forgot the old mores.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Men of Gelet soon forgot who were without their Idol were
  without course, they did not let of existing, on the other hand
  great quantity by they were following with the horrid practical
  by those which were famous. The Oscuristas of the Ebro, they are
  recalled today by their total slight to the life were the
  originators of the pests that arrased the peninsula during the
  century XIV, they were thinking that making this could give force
  to the Idol so that this returned, but actually they were not
  knowing that the Idol what was in needing was believing that
  could gave new force to It.
   </p>
   <p>
    Little by little the Oscuristas were losing power, they were
  been decimating they same, was seeming that the Butterfly never
  would return to appear, the Christians took advantage of the
  situation to be seated in the power within the dominance of the
  Order of Gelet, thus Soria it is known by its wonderful Gothic
  churches. The magicians that were followers of the Cult, could
  see as their the grip upon people was disappearing, they were
  hidden and tried to handling them from the shades, but they were
  lacking something, they had forgotten who were, they were lacking
  to communicate with the Butterfly, they were lacking let that
  their Larva Interna to blossom.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Idol returned to appear in 1464 in the hands of a young
  unknown Sacerdo called Oujel, that it was elected by Tugej as new
  Summo Sacerdo, appeared in Numancia, and Oujel repaired the
  scattered Sacerdos, that in few years were more than thirty
  Sacerdos. Certain is that some had been forgotten to the mores
  but all they had carried the violence as parts of themselves, and
  thus Oujel spoke in Numancia:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <em>
     "Reborn in the seed of the butterfly,
     <br>
      and showing the symbols of the death.
      <br>
       Though the third time is painful,
       <br>
        we should guide to our people.
       </br>
      </br>
     </br>
    </em>
    <p>
     <em>
      Ours is the fervor of its thirst,
      <br>
       thirst of power, violence and death.
      </br>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      The road will be made obscure sometimes,
      <br>
       many will have to succumb to their mistake
       <br>
        they will eat our dregs,
        <br>
         because will not be men by the terror.
        </br>
       </br>
      </br>

    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Ours is the fervor of its thirst,
      <br>

    <p>
     <em>

   </blockquote>
   Little is known of the origins of Oujel, almost
  nothing of that he had to do so that the butterfly could obtain
  the necessary force to be returned and incarnated as an Idol. But
  the Idol was there to demonstrate that they had returned to born.
  The Seed of Tugej was planted, and the Numantinos after have died
  two times and been born three were returning to be in their
  home...Numancia.
   <p>
    Numancia the then glorious capital of the Ilerguetes, from the
  days of its destruction has stayed, solitary, so alone inhabited
  by sporadic families. When in the century XV Oujel, gathered all
  the men and women that they had been scattered all over the zone,
  to accomplish his speech, was produced the Revelation of the
  Butterfly that it was not something else that a massive
  revelation of all the avatars of the present Necromancer. A
  massive Epifan=EDa rarely it happened in the known history. The
  Men and Women were converted in the new Sacerdos, and little by
  little the structure of power was been declaring, was formed The
  Seed of Tugej.
   </p>
   <p>
    From=20the first days of their training already had some
  problem with the hermetical, but the political movement that
  accomplished Oujel, permitted the Men of Tugej be joined to the
  tradition of the Euthanatos, such were admitted within the
  traditions, therefore the Hermetical could not assault them more.
  The Oscuristas knowing that the Hermetical are much more
  powerful, although don't afraid to death, The Seed of Tugej
  continues firmly along its road toward eternity.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Oujelitas, gather some nights per year on certain
  important dates. Make it of several forms, first by the physical
  plan until arriving to Numancia where is considered them low
  level Sacerdos, through dead plane where is considered them to
  full right. Then it can be expressed a complex flowchart of power
  between the Sacerdos, but always finishing in the Summo
  Sacerdo.
   </p>
   <p>
    In any way Tugej today it is much more subtle that other
  times, already they have defeated it three times, and it is not
  prepared to be defeated again. It is not that of the Cowardice
  the new political of the Order, but on the other hand that of the
  subtlety. Make well the work. But make it silently, what makes
  them some much more dangerous enemies yet.=20
   </p>
   <h2>
    The Paradigm
   </h2>
   The Oujelitas are part of the Tradition
  Euthanatos, but they are much more cruel that these, because they
  are not devoted to give the good death, they on the other hand
  are Necromantes in all the rule. They are from certain much more
  primitive point of view that the current Euthanatos.
   <p>
    The Oujelitas believe in their/its/your/his own god that has
  as demonstration a Idol, that only the Summo Sacerdo can see, and
  that according to the Oujelitas is a butterfly of three heads,
  the butterfly represents the fragility of the life, the evolution
  in life, the death, the destruction,
    <em>
     THE VIOLENCE
    </em>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    The Philosophy Oujelita is that of the violence, the violence
  carries to the man to improve, the violence brings death, and
  removes what is static, through the violence the oscurista can
  improve, furthermore through his violence returns to the other
  violent, what help to the ascension of his similar. when a life
  is lacking of sense the violence is converted into an activator
  of the spark, thus that person is returned violent and revives,
  of other form will die and relives if Tugej wants so.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Oujelitas are not linked to fact of ascending to the rest
  of the humanity, on the other hand they believe that if they
  ascend will be able to arrive to bring the age of Tugej, that it
  will be the age of the death.= =20
   </p>
   <h2>
    Magic
   </h2>
   The Oujelitas maintain a magic that is considered
  necroespiritism what they same call oscurismo. They are expert in
  the death, they are not mage that they will be prone to make fast
  and vulgar effects, on the other hand their rituals are extremely
  powerful and feared.=20
   <h2>
    Spheres
   </h2>
   <b>
    Correspondence: (The Vision)
   </b>
   <br>
    Learned this field from the other Traditions, and after many
  years a Sacerdo adapted it to the philosophy of Tugej. They are
  capable of seeing through insects, of practically any nocturnal
  kind. In addition to already learning what is sufficient, they
  can leap their body in an instant and reappear where before there
  was an insect.
    <p>
     <b>
      Entropy: (The Violence)
     </b>
     <br>
      The violence is the mother of all the other spheres, through the
  violence is procured all, the Oujelitas can be considered
  corruptive by their own violence. The Oujelitas can influence
  violence on the live and dead beings, on inanimate and animate
  objects .
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Forces: (Ignis)
     </b>
     <br>
      The fire is almost the only force that the Oujelitas know, thus
  they are capable of creating and finishing with fire. Perhaps it
  is after so many years fighting with their enemies, the
  Flambeau.
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Life: (Naturalis)
     </b>
     <br>
      Field semirestricted between the Oujelitas, alone is given to
  those which are indeed linked to the Violence, because is said
  that if the oscurista focus in the Corpus Mutatio they will lose
  sight of the real reality, The Violence.
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Matter: (Mud, Wax)
     </b>
     <br>
      The water and the natural materials are what the Oujelitas know
  as matter, they are expert in creating mud or wax statues that at
  high levels imitate life.
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Mind: (The impulses)
     </b>
     <br>
      The Oujelitas are expert in awaking impulses of terror, violence,
  passion, etc... furthermore they can access the violent part of
  people and to awaken a violent spark even in the calm.
     </br>
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Prime: (The residue)
     </b>
     <br>
      To see quintessence, furthermore when a Necroespiritista uses
  well the residues are capable of creating other impulses or
  violences. Thus the Necroespiritistas are capable of potent
  effects. The violence tends to leave a residue that a learned
  Oujelita th at knows this field can use.
     </br>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
     Spirit: (Ars Mortuus)
    </p>
    <p>
     The Oujelitas believe that the spirits are the men that
  someday will return to life and teach them to forge
  their/its/your/his own violence. Thus alone Oujelitas can accede
  to the inferior threshold. Furthermore, for power to use this
  field the Oujelitas should have something dead in hand, to act on
  some dead that would not be present, unless there was some
  connection with him. Normally and the most powerful, parts of his
  dead body.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Time: (The cycle)
     </b>
     <br>
      All the Oujelitas that they begin this field, know that the life
  and death processes always come united in cycles, the time
  effects for them are united also in the cycles.=20
     </br>

      Mage: The Ascension
  =A9
     </em>
    </h2>
    <b>
     Quintessence: (The Residue)
    </b>
    <br>
     All life, acts, facts, or violent situations are capable of
  leaving a residue that the expert Oscurista knows to collect. The
  residues that keep a relationship to the effect that they want to
  accomplish, help oscurista to guide the acts toward that path.
  The residues that do not keep a relationship, on the other hand,
  guide the randoms toward other effects.
     <p>
      <b>
       Paradox: (The Contramedida)
      </b>
      <br>
       When a Oscurista carries out an action that carries to
  unnecessary violence, there is created a reaction that punishes
  violently Oscurista. Tugej punishes those that use the violence
  in a way with little intelligence, or when a oscurista
  accomplishes extremely violent actions. (something which would
  reveal to the men the existence of the Idol)
      </br>
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Awakening: (The Larva Interna)
      </b>
      <br>
       When a Oujelita starts to take his first steps toward ascension
  he starts to perceive an impulse toward the violence. It is not
  something else but his Larva Interna, that causes his change, and
  will guide it by the road.
      </br>
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Arete: (The Larva Interna)
      </b>
      <br>
       When an Oujelita arrives to have Arete 5, his Larva Interna
  returns to be reborn (by means of a ritual that the Supreme
  Sacerdo alone knows to accomplish) and starts to communicate with
  him by means of messages that only the Oscurista can understand
  .=20

     <h2>
      Backgrounds
     </h2>
     <b>
      Arcane: (Oscurismo)
     </b>
     <br>
      Tugej today is afraid, two times has had to flee from its house,
  as soon as hides the oscuristas with the oscurismo. That it is at
  the same time their magic and their shield. The Oujelitas see
  this as a way more than to confirm that their god is alive.
      <p>
       <b>
        Avatar: (the Larva Interna)
       </b>
       <br>
        The Oujelitas upon awaking their violence are sacrificed to it,
  since to be awoken as an Oujelita your avatar is labeled during
  this incarnation by a zeal for violence.
       </br>
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Destiny: (The Brand)
       </b>
       <br>
        The Oujelitas that have been selected for a high future are
  labeled by Tugej, between its breed it chooses their chosen ones,
  thus his future will be very high and violent.
       </br>
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Dream: (The Dream)
       </b>
       <br>
        Tugej communicates with them through impulses that the Oujelitas
  do not contain, thus Tugej teaches them to be better.
       </br>
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Node: (The Altair)
       </b>
       <br>
        There are places that are converted into perfect places for the
  violence, due to the great quantity of unleashed violence already
  there. Thus large quantities of residue are formed there.=20
       </br>
      </p>
      <h2>
       Current extension of the Cult
      </h2>
      The Seed of Oujel is a cult
  that has been expanded a great deal during the last Three
  centuries. They are firmly established in the valley of the Ebro,
  southern France, Provenza and southern Italy. They can be
  connected with several cults that also carry the same stamp. So
  happens with Roman Necromanceres, which were outcasts from Tugej
  when their practices became even more terrible. The Oujelitas
  hate these traitors more than their hermetical enemies. In some
  cases, Oscuristas cults of Europe that doesn' t come from Tugej,
  can have with the Oujelitas a very profitable relationship.
      <h2>
       Current practices
      </h2>
      The magicians of Oujel are men and
  women that though could seem strange have great appreciation to
  what is material, adore be felt surrounded of luxuries, to have
  large positions between the sleepers, because they know that
  Tugej wants be present between the fatal, and the better way of
  making this is mastering them.
      <p>
       Within the structure of power of the zones in those which the
  Seed of Oujel is powerful, it is not strange to see that some of
  the most important charges are under its power. The Oujelitas
  know that pressing the sleepers, toward violent situations, cause
  them to prosper.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore it will not be of missing that a Oujelita will be
  the director of a bank that concedes few credits, and than those
  which concedes are defeated soon, or that it will be that person
  that causes that other is left the head.=20
      </p>
      <h2>
       Mood
      </h2>
      The Oujelitas should of be the bad ones of the
  movie, if some player requests you role to an Oujelita have to be
  sure that knows exactly with what is going to play, and that
  he/she doesn't know more than the necessary. The sessions that
  you make with the Oujelitas should of be of True Fear this
  heinous fear to which all we submit ourselves sometime, obscure
  places, Gothic environments, and inclusive luxurious ones.
      <p>
       If you know to carry well these Sessions, you will have an
  insatiable antagonists reserved for your chronicles.=20
      </p>
      <h2>
       Structure of Power
      </h2>
      The structure of power that it is
  represented here it is the classic, to see the current structure
  see The Seed of the Butterfly. Another text that show the Seed of
  Oujel nowadays.=20
      <h2>
       Summo Sacerdo
      </h2>
      The Summo Sacerdo is the will of Tugej, the
  is the maximum be able of the Idol in the land of the living, as
  soon as never it is discussed, it is adored, observed and
  venerated as to the own Idol
      <h2>
       The Sinistra Capita
      </h2>
      About Supreme Sacerdo there are other
  men that form the Sinistra Capita encarnacion of the three powers
  of the Butterfly, each one is so consumed by his Larva Interna
  which guides directly toward Tugej.
      <p>
       <b>
        Vera Caecus (the Blind)
       </b>
       , who continues the road of the
  truth the always says the truth though this stave, his words
  rarely they are understood by all, and perhaps the meaning will
  not be the one which one could understand. He is the truth of
  Tugej.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Iluminati (the Deaf)
       </b>
       , his road is that of the action,
  nothing can be interposed in his way. when it says it something
  one must to accomplish it. He is the action of Tugej.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Mortus (the Mute)
       </b>
       , his actions can never be discussed,
  his knowledges are those of Idol, knows all what Tugej knows and
  says to you, always listens, is said that it is died because
  nobody knows actually where it is or will appear the next time.
  He is the knowledge of Tugej.=20
      </p>
      <h2>
       Tertius Sacerdus
      </h2>
      The Tertius Sacerdo is the magician that
  governs the mundane power of the Order all the possessions of the
  Order are under his supervision. Normally there is one though
  lately they have been two. The Tertius Sacerdo, it is a man of
  great power, furthermore when the Summo Sacerdo is not, makes it
  the Judge times.=20
      <h2>
       Sacerdos
      </h2>
      It is the body of all the magicians that they
  are begun in the road of the Tric=E1pita Butterfly.=20
      <h2>
       Initiates of the Three
      </h2>
      They are all those that being
  participating of the Larva, yet they have not accomplished a work
  of value for the Order and they are not considered Oscuristas,
  they are the considered Apprentices.=20
      <h2>
       Silent
      </h2>
      They are the men that not being you participated
  of the Larva Interna, they are considered of great value for the
  order by their actions, and conduct.=20
      <h2>
       Neophytes

       <b>
        Imitator Wax (Life 3, Mind 3, Matter 4, Prime 2)
       </b>
       <br>
        The Oscurista creates a wax base, giving to it his own form. The
  Imitator is a being capable of multiple functions, and is
  apparently alive. Normally after finishing the execution time, it
  is melted slightly, thus losing the aspect.
        <p>
         It is possible to make an Imitator of another person, if there
  is a connection with that person in the moment of the execution

         It is possible that the Oscurista add to the Rote (Spirit 3) a
  being thus capable of binding a Dead to the physical form of the
  Imitator, either this a Drone, or a full rule Wraith. For the
  first, they are applied the previous rules, for the second, the g
  host is capable of any action that it will be capable of
  accomplishing. To introduce a Wraith within Imitator, is there
  has of having the assent of this, of other form is there has of
  defeating to the ghost in a faced Arete Vs Embody.

  degree, but perhaps if could deliver a case, with drug. In the
  case of a ghost, if he is capable of solving an equation of
  second degree, if he cans by his own]
