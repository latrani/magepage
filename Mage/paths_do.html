   Having finally gotten the Akashic Tradition book in my little
  corner of the world I've noticed that they Don't offer much
  expansion on the "Combat is but a small part of Do" line. So here
  is my way of providing some options for those who Don't want
  their characters to be able to shatter steel beams with their
  noses.
   <p>
    <b>
     Note:
    </b>
    Not all of this is playtested, some may need to
  be adjusted in some respects.
   </p>
   <p>
    In many cases adjustments are made to difficulty numbers of .5
  (a half) the Doists rank in Do, in all cases round up.
   </p>
   <p>
    In developing this framework for Do I have rather butchered
  the River diagram of Fu Hsi, regarded as one of the oldest
  artifacts in Chinese culture (at least by my sources).
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    Do:
    <br>
     "The way produces one;
     <br>
      one produces two.
      <br>
       two produces three,
       <br>
        three produce all beings"
        <br>
         (the way produces one, Tao Te Ching)
        </br>
       </br>
      </br>
     </br>
    </br>
   </blockquote>
   The paths of Do are many and varied, for there is a
  Do to all things (and a Do of all things). In the temporal world
  five major schools of Do have developed, each emphasizing
  different aspects of a person's being. They are fire form Do,
  water form Do, wood form Do, metal form Do, and earth form Do.
   <p>
    These styles cultivate (respectively) original spirit,
  original vitality, original essence, original sense, and original
  energy. While a practitioner of Do may only practice one school
  of Do, each school is a valid path. [possible rules for
  developing 2nd (or more) styles of Do include:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Letting the character develop any and all (not
    recommended).
    </li>
    <li>
     Letting the character abandon training and forget one style
    to learn another (very weak story wise).
    </li>
    <li>
     Letting the character learn new styles but if an old style
    is called upon before mastery is obtained then the benefit of
    the new training is lost (complex to run).
    </li>
    <li>
     Let the character learn new styles but add on the cost of
    all other levels learned to the experience cost (i.e. A
    character with water form Do 4 and metal form Do 3 wants to
    learn a new level in Do, for experience cost the current level
    is regarded as 4 + 3 = 7 [this is the method I like as it
    offers the greatest flexibility to players, keeping in mind
    that Do training is pretty hard to come by "You have became
    lost in the ways of the world. Live without harming another
    living creature for 4 seasons and you will be ready for the
    first steps in wood form Do"]), and
     <em>
      only
     </em>
     let the
    character have a total level of 5 in Do (very arbitrary). If
    you Do allow a character to have multiple forms of Do they
    should only start with one form].
    </li>
   </ul>
   The special abilities of Do do not carry over if a character
  does not have the appropriate form (the only people with the
  combat abilities of the
   <em>
    Book of Shadows
   </em>
   are the metal
  form Doists, other forms
   <em>
    cannot
   </em>
   do punches, kicks, leap
  kicks etc), they have their own abilities).
   <h2>
    The Forms:
   </h2>
   <h3>
    Water Form Do:
   </h3>
   <blockquote>
    "Nothing in the world is more flexible and yielding than
    water."
    <br>
     (the most flexible thing in the world, Tao Te Ching)
    </br>
   </blockquote>
   The practitioner of Water form Do aims to strengthen
  original vitality which is expressed as wisdom.
   <p>
    All difficulty numbers in athletics are reduced by .5 the
  Doists level.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Internal Style:
    </b>
    By focusing energy internally the Doist
  can release it in sudden bursts (reroll 10's on initiative).
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     External Style:
    </b>
    By being in tune with the environment
  the Doist knows how best to move (the Doist can roll Dex + Do
  against a target number of 8 to cancel out dodge blunders).
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Special Abilities (gained as per
    <em>
     Book of
  Shadows
    </em>
    ):
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Sparrow Flight:
    </b>
    The Doist can jump vast distances
  landing on small spaces (Dex + Do difficulty 8).
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Lightwalking:
    </b>
    The Doist can move without leaving a
  trail (Dex + Do difficulty 8) Dragon stance: The Doist can
  preform feats of balance [balance on moving car etc] (Dex + Do
  difficulty 8).
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Lung gom:
    </b>
    "The art of lung gom in Tibet produces the
  ability to travel very rapidly across some of the inhospitable
  upland wastes of that county. The training consists of living in
  complete darkness and seclusion for 39 months of deep-breathing
  exercises... It is said that one of these skilled walkers covered
  a distance of over three hundred miles in about thirty hours"
  (Lyall Watson, Supernature) (Stamina + Do difficulty 8).
   </p>
   <h3>
    Fire Form Do:
   </h3>
   <blockquote>
    "They know the world
    <br>
     without even going out the door.
     <br>
      They see the sky and its pattern
      <br>
       without even looking out the window."
       <br>
        (without even going out the door, Tao Te Ching)
       </br>
      </br>
     </br>
    </br>
   </blockquote>
   Fire form Doists cultivate the original spirit to
  produce pervasive awareness. Such people reduce the difficulty of
  awareness and alertness by .5 their level in Do.
   <p>
    <b>
     Internal Style:
    </b>
    By focusing awareness internally the
  Doist becomes aware of the cause of emotions and thoughts (Add .5
  the Doists level to the difficulty of foes attempting
  mind/emotion manipulation).
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     External Style:
    </b>
    The Doists awareness is spread out into
  the world, helping to intuitively understand the world (decrease
  difficulties of intuition by rolls by .5 the level in Do).
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Special Abilities:
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     One with the World:
    </b>
    Through tuning one's Do with the
  world the practitioner can identify those aspects that are not in
  harmony (Perception + Do target number 8 to identify
  objects/people/etc that are out of context with their
  surroundings [i.e. identify if a room has been searched through
  the furniture being rearranged]).
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     One with Nature:
    </b>
    If left to themselves things in nature
  will occupy the place most fitting for them, by harmonizing with
  nature the Doist understands where those objects/creatures are
  found (Perception + Do difficulty 8 to locate natural parts of
  the environment [of course they must be present to be
  located]).
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     One with Others:
    </b>
    By harmonizing with others the Doist
  comes to understand other people (By using Perception + Do
  difficulty 8 the Doist can determine features of group dynamics,
  who the leader is, tensions within the group, and if the group is
  complete of itself or is acting in relation to another
  group).
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Moving with the World:
    </b>
    By moving in tune with the world
  the Doist Does not stand out from the background (Dexterity + Do
  difficulty 8, the number of successes add to the difficulty of
  observers noticing the Doist, used in addition to stealth).
   </p>
   <h3>
    Wood Form Do:
   </h3>
   <blockquote>
    "The Way is unimpeded harmony; its potential may never be fully
    exploited"
    <br>
     (The way is unimpeded harmony, Tao Te Ching)
    </br>
   </blockquote>
   The wood form Doist works to strengthen original
  essence which manifests itself as gentleness, epitomized as the
  unprejudiced innocence of the infant.
   <p>
    Because of the lack of prejudice the Doist's difficulties in
  culture are reduced by .5 the level in Do.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Internal Style:
    </b>
    By directing Do internally the
  practitioner sheds those features that cause others not to accept
  them (reduce etiquette difficulties by .5 the level in Do).
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     External Style:
    </b>
    By directing their Do outwards those
  around the Doist feel more secure (adjust difficulty numbers for
  groups that the Doist is a part of by .5 level in Do in
  situations involving group loyalty [i.e. npc's fleeing,
  protester's giving up blockading a police station to demand the
  release of an innocent person]).
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Special Abilities:
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Bring Peace:
    </b>
    The Doist can quell tensions by exerting
  Do to establish a mood of harmony (Charisma + Do difficulty 8, 1
  success to calm a mildly annoyed person, 5+ to pacify a raging
  mob).
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Peace of Summer:
    </b>
    Such is the serenity of the Doist that
  people wish to befriend the practitioner (Charisma + Do
  difficulty 8 to cause people to befriend and help the Doist
  [won't work on actively angry people {see Bring Peace above}, if
  the Doist subsequently snubs/ignores/abuses the trust of the
  target of this ability they will become
    <em>
     very
    </em>
    alienated,
  if a character takes this ability they should have to act out
  employing the ability, suggested 1 success will make the postal
  employee predisposed to help sought out where a mysterious
  package came from, 5+ successes will cause the Progenitor clone
  planted in the group want to change sides], once someone is the
  Doists friend they will remain favorably disposed unless
  circumstances significantly change).
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Friend of Animals:
    </b>
    The Doist radiates such peace that
  wild animals will not attack (Charisma + Do difficulty 8, 1
  success to stop the dog from barking, 5+ for the leopard to share
  it's kill with you).
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Harmonize the Light:
    </b>
    By meditating on the estrangement
  between two people present the Doist can cause the to understand
  each other and reconcile (Manipulation + Do target number 8).
   </p>
   <h3>
    Metal Form Do:
   </h3>
   <blockquote>
    "Skilled warriors of old were subtle, mysteriously powerful, so
    deep they were unknowable."
    <br>
     (skilled warriors of old, Tao Te Ching).
    </br>
   </blockquote>
   Metal form Doists cultivate original sense to
  develop firm strength. Their powers are those of Do in the
   <em>
    Book of Shadows
   </em>
   .
   <h3>
    Earth Form Do:
   </h3>
   <blockquote>
    "... There is no way for rhinos to gore them;
    <br>
     there is no way for tigers to claw them;
     <br>
      there is no way for weapons to get at them.
      <br>
       Why? Because they have no dying ground"
       <br>
        (from life into death, Tao Te Ching).
       </br>
      </br>
     </br>
    </br>
   </blockquote>
   Water form Doists cultivate original energy which
  manifests as purity. They water form Doists can flush toxins
  (fatigue, drugs) with a roll of Stamina + Do difficulty 8.
   <p>
    <b>
     Internal Style:
    </b>
    By maintaining purity of mind the Doist
  is strengthened against having others wills enacted upon them
  (Reroll 10s on willpower resistance checks).
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     External Style:
    </b>
    By maintaining purity of body the Doist
  allows no place for damage to take place (Reroll 10s on
  soaks).
   </p>
   <p class="c1">
    Special Abilities:
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Mastery of Self:
    </b>
    Such is the Doists energy and self
  control that pain is less significant (for 1 scene the Doist can
  ignore the pain effects of [number of successes of Stamina + Do
  difficultly 8] injury levels [start counting where the dice
  penalties begin]).
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Mountain Stance:
    </b>
    Such is the internal energy of the
  Doist that they cannot be moved against their will (Stamina + Do
  difficulty 8, 1 success they can be pick up by a normal human, 5+
  successes will derail a train [though the character still takes
  damage]).
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Stun Attacker:
    </b>
    Such is the energy of the Doist that
  anyone who attempts violence upon the person on the Doist is left
  stunned (anyone attacking the Doist in hand to hand is subject to
  a roll of (Doists) Stamina + Do difficulty 8 which they resist
  against with willpower (difficulty 8), any net successes on the
  Doists part leaves the attacker unable to act for a number of
  actions equal to successes, cannot be used a a target more than
  once per a scene [but hey, how likely would most people be to try
  attacking again?]).
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Becoming One with the Goal:
    </b>
    The Doist focuses his/her
  whole being on the goal they are attempting to achieve, in this
  state the Doist can ignore distractions up to a level equal to
  (Intelligence + Do difficulty 8) until the goal is achieved. Of
  course also in this state the Doist suffers a penalty (equal to
  the benefit gained) on any attempts to notice anything not
  directly relating to the task.
