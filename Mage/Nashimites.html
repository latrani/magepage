   Holy art Thou, Lord of the universe.

    Holy art Thou, whom nature hath not formed.

     Holy art Thou, the vast and mighty One.

  As a part of my studies of the logomantic factions,
  I found references to the Nashimites of the Celestial Chorus.
  This group is said to believe that the Highest contains both good
  and evil, and that these cannot exist without each other.
  Needless to say, this is not a popular view among the Chorus, so
  I was forced to search long and hard before finding a chorister
  willing to discuss the matter. I eventually found her in the cold
  North, at a chantry in the apparently liberal Sweden which
  appears to have become a sanctuary for the oft-persecuted
  Nashimites.
  <p>
   I interviewed Veronica sitting on a bench on the Stockholm
  Northern Cemetery a sunny spring day. A few seagulls were noisily
  building a nest on top of a mausoleum belonging to a long dead
  industrialist, and somewhere a gardener was moving the grass.
  </p>
  <p>
   Interviewer: "Could you explain your faith to me?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Veronica: "Faith... that is the important word. I assume you
  are familiar with our view of the creation?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Interviewer: "More or less. It is somewhat Gnostic, isn't it?
  The One created all things out of Its essence, leaving shards of
  Its divine spirit trapped in matter."
  </p>
  <p>
   Veronica: "Yes. Look at this rock. What is it made of? An
  apprentice will immediately answer 'Quintessence'. But what is
  Quintessence? No, it is not the power of God. It
   <i>
    is
   </i>
   God.
  God is all things, and all things are God. There can be nothing
  that is not God... but of course, most things and beings have
  forgotten this. God in Its pure form is unknowable for finite
  beings like us. It is simply too vast, it encompasses
   <i>
    everything
   </i>
   . "
  </p>
  <p>
   Interviewer: "Including evil?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Veronica: "Exactly. Since everything that exists in the end is
  of God, even evil is of God."
  </p>
  <p>
   Interviewer: "So you don't accept the view that evil is just
  the absence of good?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Veronica: "No. Anybody trying to solve the teodic√©
  problem that way gets into trouble because she then has to
  explain why God doesn't do something about it. If she says God
  can't do anything about evil, then she denies the omnipotence of
  God which is one of the main tenets of our tradition, and if she
  says God can do something about it then she implies that God lets
  evil exist - which is equivalent to saying that God is
  responsible for evil. The only consistent position is to accept
  that God is beyond good and evil."
  </p>
  <p>
   Interviewer: "But you go a bit further than saying evil is of
  God, don't you? As far as I understand your views, you see it as
  equal to good!"
  </p>
  <p>
   Veronica: "Light and darkness are in perfect balance. I know
  some claim that this balance can be shifted this way or that by
  our actions, but this appears unlikely. To God all times and
  places are one, and a shift in the balance would imply a shift in
  the nature of God, which is beyond change. I see all of reality
  as one immense Song, where we take part but are able to
  improvise. We have some free will, since that is a part of God,
  but it is the free will of
   <i>
    God
   </i>
   . Nothing can happen that
  God does not want or intend, although it doesn't have to be
  deterministic."
  </p>
  <p>
   Interviewer: "So the Fall was the will of God?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Veronica: "Exactly. One could see it as the introduction of a
  dramatic theme right at the beginning, replacing the previous
  serenity and really getting the song going."
  </p>
  <p>
   Interviewer: "So what is our role in this great song?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Veronica: "To fulfil the Will of God. But we don't understand
  it, of course. We must have faith, faith in God, faith in
  ourselves, so our voices are strong and beautiful, regardless of
  what we sing. The dark and apparently disharmonious voices are
  part of the whole, which we cannot hear in our limited state.
  </p>
  <p>
   Faith is terribly important. Most beings lack faith, and just
  plod along without realising their inherent greatness or the
  presence of God around them. God does not need faith per se,
  since It is the basis for all that exists, but faith shapes our
  perceptions of God and our songs."
  </p>
  <p>
   Interviewer: "But if I have understood you correctly, it
  doesn't matter what they believe in, as long as they
  believe?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Veronica: "Yes. As long as they have faith in one aspect of
  God, they are on the right path. The details doesn't matter. Even
  some Satanists are true to God, since they worship Its dark
  side."
  </p>
  <p>
   Interviewer: "So infernalism is of God?!"
  </p>
  <p>
   Veronica: "Not exactly... there are Satanists and Satanists.
  The "good" Satanists have faith in evil, they sing with dark
  voices and fulfil the Will of God by doing evil. But then there
  are those who turn to infernalism to gain power, without having
  faith in it. And this is wrong, since they just become pragmatic
  bores serving the infernal forces."
  </p>
  <p>
   Interviewer: "Don't take this wrong, but some have claimed the
  Nashimites are a refuge for barabbi."
  </p>
  <p>
   Veronica: "There are barabbi and barabbi too. Many who have
  been called barabbi are really innocent, they just follow
  unorthodox paths and believe in odd or unacceptable things. Quite
  naturally we accept them. The
   <i>
    real
   </i>
   barabbi have sold out.
  To become a barabbi you give up everything you stand for; your
  faith, your self-respect, your paradigm. You become little more
  than a puppet to the Nephandi masters, and seek to help them
  diminish the One. And that is wrong!"
  </p>
  <p>
   Interviewer: "But I get the impression that you worry more
  about the Technocracy than the Nephandi?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Veronica: "Yes, the lack of faith the Technocracy spreads is
  much more pernicious. This is the real duty of all tradition
  mages: to make people
   <i>
    believe
   </i>
   . It really doesn't matter
  which tradition or paradigm it is, just as long as they believe.
  One could say that all mages who understand Prime are prophets,
  who
   <i>
    know
   </i>
   God (although they seldom refer to Reality as
  God). Technomancers are false prophets who try to mislead people
  into disbelief, while the Nephandi are false prophets trying to
  lead people into self- defeating acts. The Marauders are insane
  prophets who lack direction - they believe in everything."
  </p>
  <p>
   Interviewer: "So you see no problems in working with other
  traditions?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Veronica: "Have you ever pondered what is needed to found a
  workable religion?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Interviewer: "No?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Veronica: "Religions are based on faith, but also a sense of
  community. People have to get close to each other, share the same
  attitudes, be able to identify with the religion. And then you
  will need a lot more beside general faith; a philosophy, an
  ethics, symbols, rites and ideals. It has to fit in with society.
  And that is why we have so many opposing traditions - different
  religions, all based on the same faith, but with different
  attitudes. Which one becomes dominant doesn't matter and is
  mostly a question of personal aesthetics."
  </p>
  <p>
   Interviewer: "You acknowledge the importance of religion, but
  according to what you told me before this interview you have been
  a priest in the Church of Sweden until recently, when you quit.
  Why?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Veronica: "The Church of Sweden lacks faith, and has become an
  empty shell, a kind of diffuse religiosity with no direction, no
  strength. And personally I found it hard to keep my preaching
  Christ-centred as I understood my own faith better and better, so
  I decided to quit before the parishioners became too confused. I
  began to work directly with people instead, showing them the way
  through action instead of preaching."
  </p>
  <p>
   Interviewer: "I assume most people are a bit taken aback by
  your acceptance of both good and evil?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Veronica: "Indeed they are. In most cases it is best to let
  people believe what they believe, and strengthen their faith,
  instead of try to explain the symmetry of good and evil. Mages
  and some sleepers are ready for the truth, but it is hard to
  bear, since it can be paralysing to know that all acts are of
  God. Some seems to think this just leads to passive acceptance of
  everything, but that is a mistake. We all have our duties, our
  parts to sing. Our wills reflect the Will of God."
