        One of the most Sons-of-the-Etherish articles I ever read was
in Dragon Magazine, issue 204.  The article was on the technologies
presented in several books bt Lt. Col. Thoman E. Bearden and involved
supposedly " secret theories " of Nikola Tesla.  I reccomemnd the article
to every Son of the Ether out there.  I have taken some time to
convert the technologies mentioned in the articles into Mage-format rotes.
The technologies are mostly derived from the transmission of energy
through " hyperspace " between distant locations.  Here they are:

Hyperspace Transmission ( **** Correspondence )

        This rote is the cornerstone of most psychotronic processes that
the Sons of the Ether have developed.  The scientist projects energy
into the ether in such a manner that it moves instantly to another
location.  Note the rote does not itself provide the forces to be transported,
which must come from some natural ot magickal source before the mage can
affect it.

[       The mage must often get a high number of successes to transmit energy
anywhere useful.  Some Sons have solved this by using special "reciever"
focwhich they are familiar enough with to project to with few successes. ]

Co-Locate Detination ( ***** Correspondence )

        This rote is an improvement on the simpler Hyperspace Transmission.
It is used on an exploding object.  The energies of the explosion are
transmitted to more than one distant location.  The force of the explosion
at each location is not diminished.

[       The explosion can be projected into as many areas as the mage has
successes.  However, any attempt to cause the explosion to be co-located
at more than two spots raises the difficulty to ten. ]

Hyperspace Electromagnetic Pulse ( **** Correspondence, **** Forces,
                                   **Prime. - thats ***** Forces /\ )

        This psychotronic rote generates and projects a general energy
surge in an incoherent, despecialized form.  The energy is sent directly
into the patterns of the target area and has various destructive effects.
The energy arrives as a blast of heat, light, magnetism, electricity, and
other forms of radiation.
        The energy has tthe unusual property of arriving within
the targets' pattenrs, bypassiung any conventional armor including the
noteable anti-magick primim coatings of many Iteration X combat machines.
Such energy projections can be set into shell-like ward fields to
protect those within from incomming attacks.

[       The rote causes successes x4 damage.  Additionallt, the energy
stunns the nervous system, causing the victims to be incapacitated for
one round per success unless Willpoer is spent or Countermagick is used.
Electrical systems are useless for a similar period, and computers must
be rebooted ( Many Virtual Adept, Iteration X, and Void Engineer
computers are magickally hardend and "surge protected" from this unless
they are the soel target of the rote. )  Finally, molecular motion is
increased to a point where chemical and plastic explosives detonate and hight
ly combustable materials are ignited. ]

Psychotronic Disintigration ( **** Correspondence, **** Prime )

        This psychoteonic method is accomplished by establishing a
loop which projets energy into an object and starts causing it's pattern
to break down.  Quintessence that would normally excape from the
pattern breakdown are sucked into hyperspace and re-introduced an instant
later as more destructive energy.  After a critical point is reached the
pattern collapses entirely, and the quintessence that composed it is
dispered into hyperspace and unrevoerable.

[       This is similar to the Celestial Chorus effect Flames of
Purification. other than being performed at a distance, the rote's only
reals difference is that is has no statically visible effect until the
object disappears.  The Sons of the Ether have many other versions of this
type of magick, and many have their own per type of "disintigrator ray",
revelling in the cliche.  ]

Endothermic Explosion ( **** Correspondence, ***** Forces )

        This psychotronic effect is produced by causing a hyperspace
energy flow opposite that normally produced, draining the kinetic
energy of the molecules in the target area rapidly.  Careless mages are
cautioned with this rote.  Many careless maged attempting to use a forces 4
effect to do this have been incinerated by the very energy they stole, which
radiated uncontrollably from their foci.

[       The attack causes normal Forces 4 or 5 damage, and can be used to
freeze things.  The enrgy can be conentrated and stored for later use by
some mages. ]

Energy Dampening ( **** Correspondence, *** or ***** Forces, sometimes
                        *** Life )

        This Son of the Ether rote is similar to Endothermic Explosion in
that it absorbs the energy from a distant area.  Most forms of electro-
magnetic energies are drained.
        This causes the shutdown of most forms of technological devices
by denying them power, be it electrical, solar, magnetic or even nuclear
( with forces 5 ).  The mage must be able to create the force he wishes to
drain, a mage with Forces 3 wouldn't be able to stop a chemically powered
device like an internal combusion engine becuase that involves "nuclear"
forces of chemical reaction, however, the sparkplugs could be stopped from
firing.
        Mages need Life 3 to drain living beings of energy, causing raw
damage.  Those with life 4 are experimenting with more selective draining to
cause paralyzation.

Hypeerspace Tracking by Time Reversed Waves ( *** Correspondence,
                                                ** Time )
        This unusual psychotronic method allows the Sons of Ether to
locate persons they wish to strike quickly.  The rote requires as a
focus some objet which has been touched to the victim or some type of
recording of the victim's presence.  The movement of special "Time-
Reversed " or " TR " waves are tracked.  The mage follows them backwards
in time with the help of correspondence 2 effects until the target is in
view through the TR spectum.  The point of senseing is then rapidly shifted into the presend, using the TR trace to reduce the area of a Sift Through All
Space effect to a very small search.

[       This is like Filter Through All Space, but the added time
component shortens how long the search takes dramatically.  Searches are
seldom longer than a day. ]

Psychotronic Energy Scans ( ** Correspondence, * Forces, * Mind )

        This rote acts as a magickal early-warning syste.  It works though
a method called psychotonic samling, siphoning off a miniscule proportion
of an area's energy and immediately returning it.  Fluctuation in the total
energy in the area are reflected in the energy of the sample.  When something
using energy such as an animal or an operating machine enters, the amount of
energy sampled changes, and the mage can observe the change.

[       The Mind 1 component is needed to keep the subconscious manual
monitoring of the scan going.  often some kind of expert system or
an apprentice is given this duty instead.  Many mages also add Prime 1 to
detect shifts in quintessence levels as well, this reveals mages, talismans,
and other quntessesnce-related changes in the area.

Psychotronic Biological Diagnosis [ ** Correspondence, * Forces, * Life ]

        The mage uses psychotronic sampling on a subject's bio-electro-
magnetic aura.  The mage can examine the aura in this way and detemine
if the individual has any form of ailment and identify the nature of
such problems.  Sons are working on using this to read minds.

Psychotronic Biostimulation ( **** Correspondence, ** or **** Life )

        This rote uses psychotronic devices to alter the electromagnetic
fields a living thing creates.  Alteration of this field can cause the body
to react tot he psychotronic stimuli in manners identical to those of
having a physical disease or injury.  such ailments have no detectable
physical cause.
        This can also be used to re-balance an aura to promote halth and
causing the body to respond similarly.  A final option is alter the person's
aura so that it is generally more or less unballanced than natural.  This
increases or decreases the resistance of a person to disease or poison.
Careful work can change a person's aural balance with respect to a
single substance or disease only.

Psychotronic Mood Projection ( **** Correspondence, ** Mind )

        The use of Psychotronic methods to alter a person's brainwave
patterns is a very new science.  To date, mages have only developed firm
throries of sensing an projecting general emotional states through these
methods.
        The Sons are close to having a firm theory for mind-reading.
        Rumors persist of an Afganistanni Son of the Ether Barrabi that
has combined psychotronic technology and Extera-Low Frequency radio
transmission devices to develop a means of long-range Possession.
