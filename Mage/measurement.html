   Sometimes experiments may have unexpected results. Sometimes
   <i>
    very
   </i>
   unexpected results. But usually, when an experiment
  is well controlled, the results get more predictable.
  Sometimes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dr. William G. Gemmon was an excellent quantum theoretician
  and philosopher, at least according to himself and his loyal
  students. His favourite subject was the Heisenberg Uncertainty
  relations, the fundamental limits on our ability to observe
  reality. What especially vexed him was the impossibility of
  exactly measuring both the position and velocity of particles;
  the product of the uncertainties always had to be above a certain
  level.
  </p>
  <p>
   But, as he always insisted, this was against the principles of
  true Science, where there were
   <i>
    no
   </i>
   limits to the
  sufficiently inspired mind. So he set out to demonstrate a way
  that the Uncertainty Relations could be circumvented. His idea
  was to use another property of quantum mechanics, the
  superposition of states.
  </p>
  <p>
   From a formal standpoint, a system that nobody observes is in
  a mixture of all possible states, and only when observes one of
  them becomes real. The Schrödinger's Cat paradox is based on
  this: a cat is placed in a box containing a trap that will kill
  it if a certain radioactive atom decays. Since the decay is
  completely random, the box will contain a mixture of the states
  'dead cat' and 'alive cat' just before t is opened and the
  experimenter sees the result, forcing the cat to become dead or
  alive. Some (notably technocratic) scientists found this view
  unpalatable and proposed "better" solutions, but Dr. Gemmon knew
  it was the key to the Uncertainty Relation.
  </p>
  <p>
   He built a different kind of Schrödinger-box: a room (his
  lab), containing a quantum device that with exactly 50%
  probability would trigger his Omega Space Recorder which would
  record the exact position of everything in the room down to the
  quantum scale, and otherwise trigger the Omega Time Recorder,
  which would record the exact momentum of everything present.
  Finally, he linked his Transreality Computer to the devices to
  merge their information.
  </p>
  <p>
   The idea was simple: as the experiment started, the room would
  enter a mixed state: in one reality the Space Recorder would
  record all positions, in the other the Time Recorder would record
  all speeds, and the information would be merged into a
   <i>
    complete
   </i>
   recording by the computer.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dr. Gemmon set up his devices, tested them thoroughly, and
  then left the room. Using a timer the device activated, and after
  a carefully measured time interval the door opened before him,
  forcing the superposition to collapse. Reality had a choice: to
  give Dr. Gemmon the total measurement of the room despite the
  Uncertainty Relations, or to uphold the Uncertainty Relations -
  but then the devices which had been proven to work had to fail.
  So something completely different occurred to solve the paradox:
  the position and velocity of the room, devices and Dr. Gemmon
  became infinitely uncertain to all outside observers. They just
  vanished from reality. But inside the room, all information was
  perfect. Dr. Gemmon finally found a reality where Science could
  measure everything.
