Last week I found the complete set, all on one page.  They are all symbols
for alchemical processes or products.  The meanings are:
Correspondence:    Amalgam
Entropy:                To Rot
Forces:                 To Boil
Life:                      To Compose
Matter:                  Amalgamation
Mind:                    To Solve [dissolve]
Prime:                   Essence
Spirit:                    Fumes
Time:                    Powder

The citation is:
Lehner, Ernst.  Symbols, Signs and Signets (World Publishing Co.,
Cleveland:  1950)

This book's chapter on alchemical symbolism has lots of other neat
symbols, too.
