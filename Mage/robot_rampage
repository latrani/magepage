Robot Rampage ( ***** Entropy, ** Mind, **** Time )

	Robot Rampage is based on the simple scientific principles of chaos
mathematics in a logic system and psycho-surgery that most Sons of the Ether
can understand even if they aren't skilled enough to make use of the
oppertunities presented.  These theories allows the scientist to constuct a
mathematical proof that any robot or other artifically made inteilligence will
eventually suffer a degredation of both programming and circuty to a degree
that itturns into a wild, rampaging beast.  Such robots will attack any 
target that presents itself and smach nearby objects and buildings when none
are present.  Most such processes involve a considerable animosity towards the
robot's creator being engendered, and thus they attack their creator(s) in
preference of all others.
	A scientist who has mastered the doomsday science can employ these
theories effectively, quickly decrypting a short code phrase from these general
principles that will hasten the process of mental degredation to the point
where it can be made to occur at any set time after the phrase enters the
robor's data banks.  Often the artificial degredation itself is unstable and
degrades, allowing thr robot to return to a normal operating state.  A flawless
performance of the rote can place a robot into a permanent rampage though.

[	The mage must gain at least two successes in his Magick roll.  The rote
can affect not only actual robots but and artificial intelligence or a
natural intelligence that is equipped with a high degree of cybernetic mental
enhancments.  The rote has prooves effectire against AI programs, as well as HIT Marks and
some machine-educated superiors.  Victims with willpower may use this to resist the rote.
	Entropy 5 is used to attack the subject's self-control and
anti-violence programming as Entropy 3 or 4 strikes at the safety hardware. 
During a Rampage, the construct's intelligence is reduced by one per success
the mage obtained.  Negative emotions toward the robot's creator are prevented from degrading, as
is anger, while mind 2 magnifies these aspects of the victim's personality.
	The Time 4 component allows the scientist to set the time of the
outburst.  Without it, the robot enters the rampage immediately ( usually a
bad thing when the scientist is close by ).  Without Mind, the robot takes
several rounds to enter a rampage state as it's anger must build naturally, and
it bears no special animosity towards its creator. ]

Brilliant little rote! However, Iteration X has deviced
a counter-rote:

Robot Psychology (Entropy *****, Mind ***)

	This rote was perfected by Comptroller Susan Calvin, a
brilliant statistician of Iteration X in the 50's. She formulated
a general theory of artificial minds, and especially studied the
manifold ways they could fail. In most cases the problems are
simply logical misunderstandings - the AI or robot has been
given contradictory orders or implement given orders in a way that
the programmer has not intended (in short, its usually human
error rather than machine error that causes the mayhem). 

She developed a general method to find what the problem is, based
on observations of the behavior of the mind and knowledge of its
function. After finding the error, the robot psychologist simply
gives a few simple orders (the mind don't have to obey them) to
either restore normal function, or to completely lock up its
cognitive processes.

[Entropy 1 Mind 3 are first used to find the problems and weak
spots of the mind, and then Entropy 5 is used to either remove them
or lock up the mind in endless loops (this doesn't work very well
on biological minds, who merely goes catatonic or psychotic). Various
variants have been developed, like the addition of Time 2 to look up
previous records and find the plans for the design, Corr. 2 Forces 2 to
initiate direct mental contact, Matter 3 to deal with hardware problems
and Life 4 to deal with biological constructs. 

Each success will counteract a success on the Robot Rampage rote,
and if this rote defeats the other rote, the system will become
sane again and immune to Robot Rampage. If it doesn't work, the
psychologist will create a logical loop by the attempt, and
each success will decrease the machines intelligence with one as 
it spends its computing power trying to reconcile its contradictory
orders. If it is reduced below zero, the mind locks up completely.
Such minds can theoretically be restored, but it is rarely practical.]
