"[T]he cat is cryptic, and close to strange things which men cannot
see." -H.P. Lovecraft

As all* know, cats are strange. They see the Umbrae - it's said that
cats can see Death - and sometimes they travel there. But *why* do
cats hang around humanity (Awakened or otherwise)?

It has been observed that a large part of the Awakened attract cats,
not only Traditionalists (witness typical wizard/witch, for example),
but also Technomancers (Blofeld from the James Bond movies, a
NWO/$yndicate person if I ever saw one), Orphans, and even Nephandi
(the bad witch, etc.) and Marauders.

I therefore postulate** that the cats are a species of Deep Umbral
beings, hailing from a different Tellurian, who hang around Mages for
their Quintessence and/or Paradox - slowly siphoning it away, or maybe
just adding strange resonances.

Cats also hang out on the Moon's dark side, and might have some
connection to the Celestine Luna - they oppose the peculiar cats from
Saturn, somehow related to the Outsider Nephandi-Lord Tsathoggua.

Cats, typical (with thanks to Anders and the Electronic Cats who
inspired me...)

Str 1, Dex (graceful) 4, Sta 1, Cha 3, Man 3, App (feline) 4, Per 3,
Int 2, Wit 3

Alertness (observant) 4, Athletics 3, Awareness 4, Dodge 3, Stealth
(hide) 5
Older cats may also have a number of Lores and Cosmology. If a Mage
learns the language of cats, they can be skilled Mentors.

Cats have claws that do one die of damage; they are not especially
powerful fighters and will try to flee from attackers or hide. If
pressed they will vanish completely. Sometimes, a *flood* of cats
overwhelm a single target. This is *very* rare.

Willpower: 3, Arete: 4, Arcane: 0-4 (this varies with wheter the cat
*wants* to be found or not)

Powers:
Vanish away (Corr 3 Spirit 3) If unobserved, the cat can appear
somewhere else, or move into the Umbra.

Cute (Mind 2) The cat can look cute and irresistibly cuddly, or
beautiful and dignified. Each success will increase the difficulty of
harming or interfering with the cat one step the first time someone
attempts it.

Acrobatics (Corr 4) The cat's amazing feats of acrobatics can be
coincidental feats of Correspondence - leaping about, bouncing from
all availiabe surfaces, and so on.

Finder's Keeper (Corr 2, Prime 1, Spirit 1) The cat can find an
Awakened with supernatural ease, and has a tendency to appear on the
doorstep, or *inside the apartment*. They also *stay* with that person
(Corr 4), even if they can stoop to kicking the poor thing out (Mind
2)...
