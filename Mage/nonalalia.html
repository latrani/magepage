    Some books are more precious than their owners realize. The
  Nonalalia is a thin volume of poetry written by an unknown author
  under the pseudonym "Orpheus". Its slightly dated mock-leather
  cover make it look pretentious rather than beautiful.
   </p>
   <p>
    The nine long poems in the Nonalalia are unusual and
  disturbing. Most readers don't understand anything, and soon
  dismiss the thin volume as pointless avantgarde litterature. But
  many mages react immediately when they hear the haunting nonsense
  poetry - it describes the spheres of magick in a very strange
  way. Each poem relates to one sphere, and seems to link it with
  strange concepts and ideas. Some mages claim that meditating on
  the poems give them new insights into spheric magick.
   </p>
   <p>
    The truth is more subtle. The poems are not just visions of
  the spheres, but paths through the High Umbra. By reading and
  understanding a poem in the Umbra, the mage can gradually follow
  a path to the shard realm of the sphere the poem describes, and
  perhaps even further into the shade realm of the sphere. This
  alone would make the book precious to those who knew its secret,
  but it holds further secrets of another order. If a mage shifts
  poem when he is in the correct shard realm (or shade realm), he
  can follow the associations to the realm of the other sphere - a
  very surprising fact, which implies some quite strange things
  about the topology of the Umbra.
   </p>
   <p>
    By carefully studying hints and allusions in the poetry, mages
  who understand these lesser secrets will come to a startling
  conclusion: there is a certain path through the Umbrae between
  the spheres and the Earth, which allows the mage to follow the
  Great Cycle not only metaphorically, but also physically. What
  this means is very unclear, but according to alchemical doctrines
  completing such a quest would at least correspond to a great
  purification of the mageÂ¹s being, possibly Ascension. But
  the Great Cycle can also be followed in the opposite
  direction...
