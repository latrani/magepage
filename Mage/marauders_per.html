    Ram repelled them. Again, they failed to
  take
    <em>

    Ram away from the Builders. Mackgnash calmly
  watched as Lily beat her fists against her head, screaming as
  bruises already began to form on her dark skin. He grabbed her
  roughly by the wrist, pulling her up to look him in the face. She
  was silent for a moment, and then she yelled defiantly in his
  Mackgnash's face. He smiled as he threw her to the ground. Their
  spirit would not be broken!!!!
    <h3>
     The Breakers of the Wall:
    </h3>
    The Breakers of the Wall tend
  to spend most of their time in the Umbra, trying to wrest control
  of the life-form known as Proteus away from the Technocracy.
  Currently they've been transferring their minds into the giant,
  hive-mind of Proteus, and trying to overwhelm "Him" from within.
  But as each mind is merged with Proteus, another member of the
  Shard (a group of Marauder mages) is lost.
    <p>
     The Breakers of the Wall were formed during the Age of Reason,
  in response to the ever-growing Gauntlet around Gaia. Their Shard
  was dedicated to the specific purpose of Breaking the Wall, that
  the Technocracy had constructed. They have waged a ceaseless war
  against the Technocracy since then, through a variety of means.
  For starters, during both World Wars, they siphoned vast reserves
  of quintessence from the bodies of dying soldiers, and were able
  to capture countless numbers of people. The largest case of this
  was when members of the Shard infiltrated the Allied "War
  Machine" by mentally possessing several key military officials,
  and having them sway the Technocracy protected Roosevelt and
  Churchill to destroy the strategically worthless city of
  Dresden.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fates of those kidnapped by the Marauders (and declared
  dead by the Technocracy) is unknown, but by the 1960's, the
  Breakers of the Wall had grown to a membership of over thirty!
  Their actions for the next two decades remain unknown, but a
  handful Euthantos hint about a far-off realm, where the Breakers
  were teaching (and Awakening!) their new recruits. When the
  Breakers discovered Proteus in the early Eighties, they
  immediately realized the reality shaping potential of the
  creature.
    </p>
    <p>
     Since then they have been frantically trying to "infect" the
  hive-mind of Proteus with their own minds, and use "their Ram" to
  break down the Wall which prevents their brethren to freely roam
  Gaia. Now their numbers are less than two dozen, but many have
  merged with Proteus.

     Background:
    </b>
    Mackgnash I (also called One, and
  Mackgnash), is the result of a temporal anomaly. As will be
  Mackgnash III, as was Mackgnash II. No one is exactly sure what
  happened, but it is known that at some time in the future,
  Mackgnash III will travel into the past, and become Mackgnash II
  (and slightly insane as well). Mackgnash II will then be merged
  with Proteus at the order of One, only to later escape to the
  past (his mind only partially intact), after Proteus' mind is
  "altered". After Mackgnash II escapes he will change his name to
  Mackgnash One due to his becoming Mackgnash I. The temporal
  loopings confuse many, Mackgnash himself included.
    <p>
     However, Mackgnash I does not remember how he traveled through
  time (he remembers a machine), or whether or not his "Ram" sided
  with his cause. One can not even remember his life inside Proteus
  as Mackgnash II. His mind is riddled with so many holes, that he
  must create a past for himself, and in the process he creates his
  destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
     One's tried to convince his still-sane "brother," Mackgnash
  III, that their past involved empires and great palaces (as he
  told himself once, due to temporal loopings); III refuses to
  agree with anything One says, and challenges One on every point.
  One knows that someday he too must leave the Breakers, but he
  can't remember why or what he's to do after.

    <p>

     Average looking, on the good side, Mackgnash
  radiates an aura of authority and command. He is just a little
  over six feet tall, with an athletic build. He typically wears
  black power suits as both clothing and protection (see below).
  Any mage with an awareness of 3 or higher can immediately sense
  any of the Mackgnash's avatar, and any mage with a Time of 1 or
  higher can immediately sense Mackgnash III as well.

      Role-Playing Notes:
     </b>
     You don't remember much. At one
  time you had a wife and kids but something happened to them. The
  woman was yelling and you heard glass breaking. Then you remember
  a joke that was so funny you cried. Then there was the Ram, your
  mighty Ram, and then you were where you are today. You remember
  that you
     <em>
      have
     </em>
     to lead the Breakers of the Wall, and that
  alone reaffirms your doubts and misgivings, and helps you hide
  them from the rest. It's all too fragmented.
    </p>
    <p>
     You try to convince your "brother," number III, that he
  doesn't want to go home, but he won't listen to you. Until you
  can remember why he doesn't want to go home (among other things),
  you'll lead the Breakers.

     Background:

    NOWONOW was known as Jack Smith, and was
  once a normal person. He worked at an animal pound, burning the
  animals that had been put to sleep. While he hated his job, he
  feared how he would suffer if he quit it, and so he continued to
  work until the flames spoke to him.
    <p>
     They screamed at him, vomiting the charred corpses of the
  animals at him in wave after wave, Jack screamed as the creatures
  began to rend his flesh. When his supervisor arrived, she found
  Jack curled into a fetal ball, his eyes wide open but
  unseeing.
    </p>
    <p>
     The doctors said that Jack had suffered a complete nervous
  breakdown, and that he had forced himself into a catatonic state.
  In reality, he had fallen into an incredibly deep state of Quiet
  after spontaneously awakening, and had yet to recover. When he
  did finally slip out of his catatonia, he had created a new
  persona. NOWONOW!

     NOWONOW likes to use Life to alter his
  appearance on a regular basis. Originally, he was a half black,
  half Native American, with dark skin and long black hair. He
  stood about six foot three, and had an average build. He always
  used to have a somewhat sad look on his pock-marked face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Currently, he tries to look like a caucasian punk, dressed in
  "fifties duds," with a green mohawk, and a sinister sneer.

  disapproval. For the first fifteen years of your life you lived

  in there, reading fairy-tales, and any other books they would
  give you. Then one day grandmommy stopped visiting you in the
  attic, and then granddaddy. You went downstairs to find them, but
  they were gone.

     You stayed in the house for a few weeks before the strange man
  entered your house. He did bad things to your grandparents stuff,
  and then he came over to you. When he was done, he left, and you
  went up to the washtub in the attic to clean off the stains he
  made. As you sat in the tub, trying to wash away the blood, a

    <h4>
     Rotes:
    </h4>
    <b>
     NOW! (Forces 4, Time 3):
    </b>
    A truly
  devastating rote created by NOWONOW, NOW! allows the caster to
  increase the kinetic force of an brawling attack, and then allows
  him to rapidly repeat it. The end result is a hailstorm of
  punches and/or kicks with the strength of a sledgehammer.
    <p>
     [While only good for one attack before needing to be recast,
  NOW! increases the damage of an attack, and allows for multiple
  hits. The caster takes his total number of successes, and assigns
  them as follows: every two successes assigned to damage
  multiplies it by an additional +1; every two successes assigned
  to number of hits increases them by an additional +1.
    </p>
    <p>
     For Example, NOWONOW runs into a pair of police. He
  coincidentally casts this rote (they think he's pumped up on
  drugs), and rolls six success on his arete roll. He assigns four
  success to damage (meaning his punches do &lt;normal damage x
  [1+2]&gt;), and two successes to his speed (allowing him two
  rapid attacks). He punches the first in the face, splintering his
  skull, and kicks the second in the ribcage, crushing the cop's
  lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sometimes, being psychopathic comes in handy.]
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Schizo-Virus (Forces 2, Life 5, Prime 2, Mind 3/4):
     </b>
     Invented by Mackgnash I and Lily, the Schizo-Virus is the means
  by which the Marauders plan to gain control over Proteus.
    </p>
    <p>
     [The caster of this rote causes a being to be transformed into
  a biochemical electrical field (Forces, Life, and Prime) known as
  the schizo-virus. The transformed individual then enters his
  "host," and begins to try to dominate the mind either by subtle
  suggestion or outright domination (Mind 3 or 4 respectively).
  Since the subject has become a part of the "host's"
  bio-electrical field, wherever the "host" goes, so will the
  schizo-virus.
    </p>
    <p>
     A combination Forces 2, Life 3 effect could be used to purge
  the host of the schizo-virus, but due to the Mind effect required
  in this rote, the schizo-virus will become aware of any such
  attempt as soon as the host thinks of it. Since the schizo-virus
  is merged with its host's bio-electrical field, it can also
  control it, causing neural messages to be sent through the host's
  body, and stopping such messages (such as breathing, and
  heartbeat).
    </p>
    <p>
     So far, only the enormous sizes of Proteus' mass and hive-mind
  have prevented the Breakers from gaining control. Which is why
  they continually try to infect Proteus with more of their
  members, until "He" reaches a "critical mass," and becomes
  theirs.]

    <p>
     <b>
      Eat Me RAW! (Life 4, Correspondence 2):
     </b>
     A hideous rote
  developed by Breath, "Eat Me RAW!" allows the caster to skin a
  target. The rote gets its name from Breath's tendency to flay his
  enemies, and began to eat their exposed, raw flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
     [By using the rote, the mage perceives his target's Life
  Pattern, which is then flayed off of the body. This is
     <em>
      very
     </em>
     Vulgar, and does damage as listed for the Life

    Looking like a normal, dark black suit, the Power Suit of
  Mackgnash I is anything but. While it does bear a strange
  resemblance to the suits worn by Mackgnash II and III, only One's
  suit radiates with power.
    <p>
     The suit possesses a number of powers. It can "reflect" any
  physical attack back onto it's attacker (Correspondence 4); the
  suit prevents magickal detection from afar by projecting a fake
  copy of Mackgnash's Life pattern elsewhere, while hiding his own
  (Correspondence 4, Life 1, Prime 3); and finally, it can hold up
  to six spirits (its arete rating) that Mackgnash has summoned,
  and release them at One's request (Spirit 4).

     Down the cold corridors of stone, deep below the pillars of steel
  and the paths of asphalt, the Acolytes whipped themselves into a
  frenzy. The Kindred assembled around them marveled at how these
  Awakened kine could create so much of the precious vitae. As the
  assembled Malkavians drank of the magi's blood, they were exposed
  to new vistas of awareness. They saw the world that these magi
  would create for them, where they would form an army and rule as
  gods once again....
     <h3>
      The Acolytes of Vitae:
     </h3>
     The House of Tremere isn't the
  only group of magi to see the Kindred as a way to defend the
  power of magic within the world. But whereas the Tremere became
  undead to continue their powers, the Acolytes of Vitae seek to
  return vampires to the world (and thereby return magick to the
  world).
     <p>
      Founded in shortly after the Inquisition, the Acolytes were
  once a group of simple Celestial Chorus members suffering from
  severe depression at seeing the evils that had been done by the
  Europeans they had wished to save. While roaming the Deep Umbra,
  looking for a way to stop their spiritual decline, they found a
  bizarre new world known as the Periphery by the natives, and an
  even stranger visitor stranded there.
     </p>
     <p>
      The stranger, Roe, pleaded with the magi, knowing what they
  were, to return him to Gaia, and in return he would give them the
  Enlightenment they sought. While skeptical, and sensing that this
  was a Kindred before them, they still decided to take the undead
  with them back to Gaia. Some speculate that the Choristers felt
  intense guilt for all those (including Kindred) who suffered from
  "their" Inquisition, others say that Rox used his Disciplines
  against the already mentally uneased magi. For whatever reason,
  the magi returned Roe to Gaia, where he promptly forced each to
  take a "enhanced" drought of his vitae.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon drinking the blood of Roe, the magi immediately were
  exposed to the possibilities of Kindred existence. Gone were
  their self-doubtings, and guilt. They had seen the light of the
  One, felt the One's presence in this Kindred before them, and
  they would do anything their savior asked. They were blood-bound
  to a fourth-generation Malkavian, Roe, the creator of
  Dementation. Roe, their saving Angel.
     </p>
     <p>
      Since that time, the Acolytes have been busily aiding Rox in
  his bids to gain control over the North-Western Part of the
  United States. They share his dream of a world ruled by the
  Malkavians (with Roe as king), a world where the Kindred, the
  fey, and the creatures of the Mythic Age would walk the earth
  freely once more.
     </p>
     <p>
      In order to show their devotion to Rox (also known as Roe, and
  Malraux), the Acolytes have taken vows of silence (which they
  have held for over three centuries!), become flagellants, and
  offer their magickal aid to their Angel.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deep within the American North-West, a great evil is
  brewing....

      Brother Francois was a young monk in
  Barcelona over five hundred years ago. He joined the Celestial
  Chorus, and truly felt as if he was in the light of the One. Then
  the Spanish Inquisition came, and the Kindred began to be
  destroyed, along with the Garou, and even his friends among the
  magi. Francois felt a great pain, and he and five others set out
  to see if they could find a way to atone for "their" crime.
     </p>
     <p>
      In their wandering Francois and his fellow Choristers came
  across the Periphery and Roe. After being blood-bound and
  returning to Gaia, Francois and his fellows took their vows and
  formed the Acolytes of Vitae. Francois has been responsible for
  developing the "Living Chalice" rote, and the "initiation" of
  over two score of Kindred, Mortals and others into Roe's kingdom.
  But now Francois is beginning to have doubts, and is beginning to
  want to struggle against Roe, and Roe's plans for world rule.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>

      Brother Francois could be a dashingly attractive
  man, if it weren't for the numerous scars and starved frame he
  has. Francois believes wholeheartedly in the path of the
  flagellant, and that his suffering will atone for the crimes of
  himself and his brethren. He typically wears faded brown robes,
  and has a saddened look on his face.

      Living Chalice (Correspondence 4, Life 4,

     This rote allows the mage to
  Blood-Bond drinkers to Roe, without the victim's knowledge. In
  order to cast this spell, the Acolytes whip their flesh, until
  the skin breaks (a cosmetic effect, that does no damage to the
  caster). At that moment, the assembled Kindred will begin to
  feast on what they assume to be the magi's blood, but is in fact
  the blood of Malraux.
     <p>
      [By combining Correspondence with Life/Matter/Prime, the magi
  are able to transport Malraux's blood (stored in a large cauldron
  for this purpose) to the opened wounds across their bodies. The
  Mind sphere is also used to strengthen the feelings of loyalty
  inherent to the blood bound (which still occurs over three
  drinkings), and weaken the vampire's ability to realize that they
  aren't drinking true magi blood.
     </p>
     <p>
      When cast by a cabal of five ancient masters with the aid of
  an antediluvian, this spell tends to be able to sway any
  kindred.]

       Eye Scream Truckers:
      </h4>
      <blockquote>
       Now here's a story Kraton used to tell me.
       <p>
        "... Marauders? You want to know about Marauders?!? Only met
    one group of 'em once, and let me tell you, they were the most
    psychotic batch of cats I ever saw. They drove a weird-ass
    ice-cream truck around the world, trading all sorts of crazy
    shit for Technos' junk."
       </p>
       <p>
        "I remember the time me and Starlight was hunting the people
    who had trashed her family's home and taken her folks.
        <em>
         She
        </em>
        figured the Technos had taken 'em, but I knew
    better. The place was trashed, and there weren't even any
    Progenitor Clones left to trick, or any wards or anything. They
    even left a trail for us to follow in my van!"
       </p>
       <p>
        "We had followed their path for about fifty miles when it
    just stopped in a parking lot. It wasn't until I used some
    simple magick to locate the truck, that we saw it sitting in
    the damn lot! My god! Here was this bright pink, ice-cream
    truck, and we didn't even see it! On each side was a giant eye
    with a screaming mouth where the retina should be, and painted
    underneath was
        <em>
         Eye Scream Enterprises
        </em>
        ."
       </p>
       <p>
        "Me and Starlight knew we were dealing with some weird-ass
    shit; the truck was so Arcane, I had to wonder how even it's
    owners could find it. But Starlight wasn't going to be turned
    away without some answers. She walked up and pounded on the
    truck's side. She was pumped up on something, cause her banging
    was leaving dents in the side of the thing."
       </p>
       <p>
        "The door opened, and we saw this little green teddy-bear
    thing stick his head out and say 'We're closed, come back
    tomorrow.' Starlight ripped the damn door off, and I got a
    lightning bolt ready to toss. The bear jumped out with a sword
    bigger than him and whined about how we shouldn't have done
    that, and how he only wanted to be our friend. He even seemed
    sad when he hacked off Starlight's arm."
       </p>
       <p>
        "I let him have it right then with my lightning. Let me tell
    you, it knocked him off his little, green ass. I heard a voice
    in the back ask 'What's going on,' as Starlight "fixed" her
    arm. I know I warned you about paradox, but there are times
    when you can't afford not to be vulgar."
       </p>
       <p>
        "A friendly spirit I'd summoned a while back came up to us,
    and warned us that the Techno's were a-comin', so Starlight and
    I marched into the truck to see what was going on in there. I
    was too busy seeing the bear-thing get back on it's feet to
    notice Starlight gasp."
       </p>
       "It seems there was a boy in the
    back, playing a game of checkers with her folks. Her dead
    folks. Just then another boy, an albino, walked up to the car
    and started yelling at us. Now I know my speech ain't proper
    for a church, but this kid was teaching me a phrase or two!"
       <p>
        "Starlight was hurting pretty bad, and she kinda lost it
    seeing her folks dead and all. She was crying when she asked
    the kids to give her her folks back. The one playing checkers,
    a brunette, was kinda upset, but the albino started bitchin
    about all deals being final. I glared at him and said, 'Oh
    yeah?'."
       </p>
       <p>
        "The next thing I knew I was picking myself up from the lot,
    my ribs broken in two places, and most of nerves yelling about
    how much they didn't like me at the moment. Starlight came out,
    smiling, and told me she had made a deal with the albino.
    They'd trade her folks for that beat up van that had been
    following them."
       </p>
       <p>
        And that was how old Kraton learned about Marauders and lost
    his van.

      The Eye Scream Truckers are a small Shard of
  Marauders who have become the targets of Tradition, Technocracy,
  and even Nephandi forces. The Eye Scream Truckers, currently
  numbering two mages and their three Consors, travel Gaia
  collecting materials to "produce and sell." Among the products
  they make are zombies, magic items, and extremely bizarre
  ice-cream.
      <p>
       Hailing from the Periphery, the two mages of the group, Billy
  Morgan (an albino) and Timothy, were on hard times. All the other
  Eye Scream Truckers were stealing their customers. In the
  Periphery, death was so common, that people bought the
  re-animated corpses of the dead in order to keep themselves
  company (and have a "distraction" for any would-be
  attackers).
      </p>
      <p>
       Billy convinced Timothy that they needed to expand their
  market to attract potential customers, and so they began buying
  items created by the other races of the Periphery. Along the way,
  a cybernetically enhanced cat named Mitzy, a Grummykin
  warrior/play-mate named Happy-Green-Horticulture (or Happy for
  short), and a small horde of the living dead began to travel with
  them.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Timothy met with the strange man who claimed that the
  Periphery was just one world, a world where "Ma-raud-ers" had won
  the "Ass-cent-eon" War, Billy soon became intrigued with the idea
  of franchising his company. By devouring the weird man's mind,
  Timothy discovered a world called Gaia, which held things
  undreamt of in the Periphery (and vice-versa).
      </p>
      <p>
       Billy soon had a vision of an inter-dimensional market, where
  he would take goods from one world, trade them for enormous
  amounts of items, and then sell the items back in the Periphery
  at an even bigger profit. And so the Eye Scream Truckers came to
  Gaia.

  time flat. Curse a lot, about everything, in as many obscene
  words as you can think of. You really need a vacation.

      (as told by Billy Morgan) "Be afraid. Be
  very, fucking afraid. He's a real dip-shit, but he knows more
  about the bibbidy-boppity-poo-poo than any other SOB I've ever
  met. He mumbles something about a Dreamer in his sleep."

       "As near as I've been able to figure, he is part of this
  Dreamer (a real schizo-god) who broke off the parts of its mind,
  and sent them out to become gods as well. Then this god absorbed
  these new gods, increasing his power as well. If my hunch is
  right, Timothy is the latest "offspring" of this god. Problem is,
  Timothy's power is growing, but he's afraid of it, and he's
  afraid he can't control it too well."

       You were a scientist in your father's
  palace. You studied the way your pet humans mated, and tried to
  create several cross-breeds, and new genders. But the secluded
  life of your father's palace left you hungry to explore, and so
  you set out on your own.
      </p>
      <p>
       You soon ran into Timothy during one of Billy's zombie sales
  in a recently destroyed village. You joined up, and have become
  the only member of the group to stand-up to Billy's endless
  rants. Currently you are arguing with Billy over wether or not he
  has the right to retain his semen from albino breedings, or if it
  must be donated in the name of your scientific research. Maybe
  you'll just use a hypo-needle and steal some when he's
  asleep.

       Always doing something cute, Mitzy is just your
  typical little housecat. She's covered in white fur, with black
  points which make her look like a Siamese (which she is half). Of
  course, her eyes are made of metal, and she can have two 3 foot
  long steel cables extend from her back in time of need.

       You live for three things: science,
  sex, and making people acknowledge your superior mind. It's not
  that you're arrogant; you just don't get the credit you deserve.
  And while you're at it, give Billy all the hell you can, without
  pushing him too far. He thinks he's as good as you!! Stupid
  human.
      </p>
      <p>
       Timothy and Happy are good enough, always listening to your
  latest discoveries. But if the truth be known, Billy may be right
  about Tim, and that bothers you (both Tim being a god, and having
  to secretly admit Billy being right).

      Described earlier, the semi-truck of Billy and Timothy has a
  variety of strange abilities. For starters, it has an effective
  Arcane rating of 5, allowing it and it's contents to hide in the
  most crowded parking lot of New York, unseen! It seems to be able
  to travel from the Periphery to Gaia, and vice-versa (Spirit 5),
  as well as being able to repair damage to itself (Matter 4, Prime
  2). The truck manages to keep its cargo preserved from the forces
  of Paradox, by channeling free Quintessence to its occupants
  (Prime 3). Finally, in times of need, the truck can animate
  itself and come to the aid of either Billy or Timothy (Spirit 2).
      <p>
       This truck contains hundreds of bizarre devices for sale, from
  "Heat-Seeking Throwing Knives" and plasma rifles, to the living
  dead and something called "Liquid Salvation." In fact, near the
  back of the trailer, Billy has stored dozens of artifacts from
  alternate dimensions all for sale to the highest bidder (STs, go
  wild).

       Rotes:

      <b>
       Deal of the Century (Mind 3)
      </b>
      Billy created
  this rote in order to better persuade potential customers. While
  this spell is slow in its effect, it has a large radius, and
  produces great results.
      <p>
       [The rote works by influencing the emotional patterns of an
  individual, gradually weakening any resistance to Billy's sales
  pitches, and increasing the desire in a person to spend their
  money.
      </p>
      <p>
       This spell doesn't have any game terms per say, but a person
  may try to resist by rolling Willpower at a difficulty of 9, with
  each success canceling one of the caster's (Billy's had a lot of
  time to perfect this rote).]

       Hidden far away, in the Deep Umbra, lies a universe formed by the
  unknown dreams of ignorant gods. The natives call it the
  Periphery, and it is the home of thousands of Marauders and
  remnants of the Mythic Age. And it is the home of things man can
  only begin to guess at....
