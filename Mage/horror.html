    Here is something to scare, sicken and sadden your players
  with.
   </em>

   The apprentice tried to brush the chalk-dust from his clothes
  while the master inspected the circle. "Good work, but the next
  time, don't try to impress me with writing the names in enochian.
  Plain Hebrew is just fine. Now, fetch me my robes." While the
  apprentice scurried away, the mage prepared the altar. The red
  and grey candles were correctly positioned around the room, the
  Seal of Solomon placed on the altar, the mirror stood in the
  Triangle of Art. Good, soon the accursed one would suffer
  horribly for his treachery, the mage thought with glee.
   <p>
    "...and by the name
    <em>
     Sabaoth
    </em>
    , which Moses named and
  all the rivers turned into blood, and by the name
    <em>
     Ashar Ehieh
  Oristone
    </em>
    , which Moses named and all the rivers brought forth
  frogs, and they ascended into the house destroying all things, I
  hereby open your body for all the forces of Tartarus and the
  nethermost realms!" The mage triumphantly raised his fist against
  the old man he saw in the mirror. The man looked up, and for a
  moment their eyes met. Then the mirror cracked with a resounding
  sound and the candles around it blew out. The mage screamed
  curses at the universe and his enemy, his face red with anger and
  frustration. Suddenly he noticed a movement in the broken mirror.
  That's funny, he thought, my apprentice isn't in the room...
   </p>
   <p>
    The apprentice was downstairs when he heard the scream. It was
  an inhuman, bestial sound, and most definitely his master! He
  dropped his laptop and ran up the stairs, two steps at a time.
  Halfway up the stair he felt an revolting odor and heard a female
  laugh inside the study. A feeling of absolute dread filled him.
  Summoning all his courage he ascended the rest of the stairs,
  each step slower than the last. Suddenly the door to the study
  began to open. The smell became unbearable. He only glanced at
  the door, seeing something that once may have been a human hand
  around the doorknob, and then he turned and ran.

   <hr>
    Miriam Kraig was a renegade Verbena, who used her magick to
  remain young, beautiful and dangerous. She was also a borderline
  marauder, who arrogantly used magick as if nothing could happen.
  In her long and eventful life, she earned a living as a rogue,
  stealing tass and talismans, killing people (or other beings) and
  generally using her magick for fun and profit. She became more
  and more enthusiastic with horrible Life 4 effects, using them to
  scare and kill her enemies.
    <p>
     In her last fight she liberally used horrible Life 4 attacks
  against everyone, gaining considerable amounts of paradox.
  Finally she was defeated, and almost killed. In her last
  conscious moment she called upon her ally Abyss, who saved her.
  Abyss (Also known as Choronzon to the Order of Hermes, who only
  whisper about it) is a powerful and enigmatic spirit, inhabiting
  the great Abyss between the near and deep umbra. Miriam fell down
  a crack before her enemy's eyes, and disappeared into the
  umbra.
    </p>
    <p>
     Miriam was in a coma, and charged with extreme amounts of
  paradox. Her powerful will to live struggled against her failing
  body and the dissolving enchantments she had made. The paradox
  began to seep out into the changeable deep umbra. Her own magick
  turned against her, helped by paradox and her pain. Her body
  became warped by the paradox, turning into horrible forms without
  end. Miriam awoke in the abyss transformed into the Horror.
    </p>
    <p>
     The endless pain of her new existence drove the Horror
  completely insane in a few hours. It became a kind of lurker at
  the threshold, skulking around the gauntlet searching for a way
  out. If someone opens a portal in the wrong place it may escape.
  The forces of paradox are still strong in it, and in fact it can
  be regarded as a kind of paradox spirit. If someone gains paradox
  by damaging Life magick, it might appear for revenge (mistaking
  the mage for its original enemy).
    </p>
    <p>
     The Horror does not have any true shape. It looks like a
  humanoid, constantly victim of painful and disgusting changes. In
  one moment it's a dried up husk, in the next bloated with pus
  running out from openings everywhere, in the next moment it is
  turned inside out and so on. The storyteller should be creative
  and gruesome. The only constant thing about it is her voice,
  which still is a low, seductive female voice filled with
  pain.
    </p>
    <p>
     The only way the Horror has to relieve its pain is to give it
  to someone else, by warping its victims into horrible shapes.
  This will give the Horror a short moment of relief from the pain
  and transformations, but they will return in a moment. Thus the
  Horror is constantly seeking after life to destroy.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Typical Magick of the Horror:
    </h2>
    <b>
     Life 4:
    </b>
    Constant
  horrible transformations of itself. Its eyes explode, its blood
  vessels turn inside out, its inner organs become liquid, its
  skeleton grows long thorns piercing its flesh, its skin dissolves
  or any other disgusting effect the storyteller can imagine. These
  effects do not impede the Horror anymore, since pain and
  transformation are the only constants of its existence now.
  Sometimes they even help it.
    <p>
     <b>
      Life 3:
     </b>
     It will not die due to its Life 4 magick, which
  in a way heals it. In the changing flesh of the Horror, only
  aggravated wounds will remain for long, and it might use vulgar
  magick to heal them. While the Horror really desires oblivion,
  its will to live is extremely strong (a la the Beast in
  vampires), and it will do anything necessary to survive.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Life 2:
     </b>
     The Horror will transform any lower form of
  life it encounters into something like itself. These small
  horrors will of course die immediately, but their bodies remain
  twisted and warped. Insects turn into beautiful, living lattices
  of chitin, plants begin to bleed from screaming wounds and trees
  crack, only to reveal intestines. This lessens the pain of the
  Horror a little bit.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Life 1:
     </b>
     It is always conscious of all life in the
  vicinity, and generally the Horror is malevolent against it.
  Every living being must be turned into pain and warped flesh.
