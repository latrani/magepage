First off: I agree with all these versions of Ascension. I've got one 
more way to explain it, based on a real-life belief central to 
Buddhism.

Say you go sit under a tree and stay there until you really, -really- 
understand the nature of the universe, the cycles of life, the purpose 
of mankind, yourself, and all the lesser gods. You realize that you 
are becoming one with the whole of creation and its creator, the 
greater god. You get about halfway to heaven, and you take one last 
look back at the earth and your old life, and you see that you 
brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, etc. are miserable. They can't 
understand what's happening to them, why they die and are reborn and 
die again ‹ stuck like blind men naked in a briar patch. You decide to 
put off going to heaven for just a bit, until lots of your fellow men 
can go with you. This is how Buddhists explain the boddhisatvas 
(forgive me the spelling and oversimplifications).

This works pretty well for explaining Oracles in Mage. They've reached 
ultimate understanding of the universe, and they decide to stick 
around instead of joining with their creators. (Lucky for us at the 
White Wolf offices, who'd be pretty damn embarrassed if they did show 
up!)

Second: So far as I know, the reason we don't have Anders writing for 
us is that we need SOMEONE objective to review our books on the net, 
and hiring him would kinda create a conflict of interest.
