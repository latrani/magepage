  <h1>
   NEWTONIA
  </h1>
  <i>
   by Richard Bell
  </i>
  <p>
   Newtonia is governed by the paradigm that the results of the
  Michelson-Morley experiment was properly interperated. Light
  travels at constant speed with respect to the ether, the Earth is
  at rest with respect to the ether, and the Earth is at the center
  of the Universe (supported by Hubble's observations). The major
  effect of this was to prevent the need to create quantum physics
  to explain the effects of an ether-less universe.
  </p>
  <p>
   EVERYTHING IS DETERMINATE; THERE IS NO UNCERTAINTY; NEWTON'S
  CLOCKWORK REIGNS SUPREME.
  </p>
  <p>
   All of Newtonia is ordered. The landscape has been sculpted
  into what people think Nature should be like. The roads twist and
  turn, not because they follow an old cow-path, but because curves
  in the roads make the towns and cities more pleasant. Garou
  visiting Newtonia will find it very distubring (more on them
  later).
  </p>
  <h2>
   Economics:
  </h2>
  The economy of Newtonia is driven by tass. To
  make the sleepers comfortable with the idea that "Prime is
  Money", most of the nodes were shifted to the mines, oilfields,
  factories, and universities. Tass is available in low-grade, and
  high-grade, forms. Coal, oil, natural, gas, and mineral ores are
  all low-grade tass (a few tenths of a point per ton), while
  ergominium (at one point per kg) is high grade. Coinage is minted
  with a Matter 2, Prime 3 effect to remove any undesirable
  resonances. The fact that the currency contains quintessence
  makes counterfiets impossible to pass of on Scientists with at
  least Prime 1, and criminals who circulate counterfiet coinage
  among the sleepers are actively hunted. Scientists could cause
  rampant inflation, in theory, by meditating at nodes and flooding
  the economy with new coins (a single point of quint is alot of
  money); the consumption of quint in experiments offsets this
  effect (three points of quint spent to reduce the difficulty of
  an effect would be three months' pay for a day-labourer). To keep
  the tass flowing, rail lines, pipelines, canals, and roadway all
  run along ley-lines.
  <h2>
   Technology:
  </h2>
  Without Quantum Physics, there are no
  electronics, but that does not eliminate high technology. There
  are mechanical and fluidic computers driving the information
  technology, and there are no quantum effects to limit
  possibilities of miniaturization. The television is based on
  reciprocity of an interesting effect: when certain crystals are
  mechanically stressed, they emit light, so when they are impinged
  upon by light, they deform. There is an equivalent of every
  high-tech device in Newtonia, it just works differently. Laser
  beams are emitted by incredibly small klystrons and magnetrons;
  supercomputers based on the wave interaction of beams of light
  are every bit as fast as semiconductor processors, even though
  they are fundamentally different.
  <p>
   The industrial prime mover is the steam turbine; although,
  extensive use is still made of the piston internal combustion
  engine, and gas turbines where specific power is important
  (automobiles and aircraft). Mass transit is powered by steam or
  electric locomotives. Air travel is by lighter-than-air, gas
  filled, dirigibles; winged and rotorcraft; or cavorite (gravity
  shielded) airships. Water- borne transport is by steam or
  sail.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Standard of Living:
  </h2>
  There is little crime, and no
  unemployment. The Economists ensure that there are opportunities
  for all of the sleepers. Psychiatric specialists can adjust
  deviants, when they crop up, so there are also no prisons. All
  homes and apartments have gas lines, waterlines, compressed air
  lines, along with the microbore tubing that carry the basic four
  audio, and two video information and entertainment channels (the
  television is a shuttered gaslight with mirrors controlled by a
  pneumatic computer). Mechanical devices in the home are powered
  by either air or gas turbines depending on size. More affluent
  residences have electricity, and electrical appliances, and can
  receive the radio broadcasts. Within the city, the limited of
  pneumatic, or hydraulic information lines is not a problem, and
  electric telephone lines link up the cities.
  <h2>
   Society:
  </h2>
  The society is structured along the lines of
  victorian england, and any sleeper at home in one, would quickly
  get used to the other. Mages would find startling differences.
  The sleepers know about the existence of SCIENCE!, and understand
  that Scientists are striving to improve everybody's lot. Mages
  who are not Scientists are accepted, so long as they do not
  indulge in luddism. Tribals, as non-Scientific mages are called,
  often find work as mediums and faith healers, and the greatest
  criminologist of the realm is a cultist of Ecstasy. The sleepers
  know that if they are in dire straits, they can go to the
  Scientists, and in return, they allow the Scientists to govern.
  Scientists are expected to always help sleepers for no more than
  the sleeper can reasonably afford. Many members of Newtonia's
  elite are sleepers, as the Scientists often have more important
  things to aquire than wealth and power. The education system
  sifts through the each generation to ensure everyone finds their
  place, and no task is left undone.
  <p>
   Mage society centers around The University which is divided
  into the colleges of Dimensional Science
  (Correspondence),Thermodynamics (Entropy and Prime), Physics
  (Forces), Chemistry (Matter), The Humanities (Mind), Biology
  (Life), and Chronology (Time). Some Dimensional Scientists dabble
  in Spirit, but such research is not considered important. The
  seven faculties are housed in a huge ring of building around the
  Great Meeting Hall. The Hall is situated above the only node in
  the capitol city of Philosophia (which encourages Scientists to
  take part in the discussions of State). All of the other regions
  of Newtonia also have research institutes above nodes where
  Scientists gather to discuss business [and aquire quintessence];
  these gatherings are called symposia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Scientists are charged with the care of the sleepers, and
  disputes are almost always decided in favour of the sleeper. Mage
  crimes are Luddism, (attacking the State), theft of resources
  (tass), and abusing the sleepers. These crimes are always dealt
  with promptly, and with great severity. For example, any mage who
  kills sleepers by rending them for quintessence will be
  gilgulled, and then pattern bled at regular intervals until he
  has learned his lesson, before being finally executed.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Police, and Other Petty Officials
  </h2>
  Because of the
  temptation to meddle with the minds of annoying constables and
  beaurocrats is very great, they are selected for very high
  willpower and/or implanted with devices that record external
  mental influences. As the eugenics movement is strong in
  Newtonia, strong willed sleepers are shockingly plentiful. Thus
  petty officials have, depending on their authority, willpowers of
  8, 9 or 10. The exception are the customs officials, who have 10
  willpower to a man. All peace officers are perceptive and aware,
  even though they are sleepers. All influencing mind effects
  against peace officers are vulgar with witness.
  <h2>
   Kindred
  </h2>
  The rules of the Masquerade are different in
  Newtonia, due to the ruthless efficiency of awakened vampire
  hunters. No killing, no forced taking of vitae, and never
  drinking deeply of any vessel. Creating progeny is very
  difficult, due to the trouble of finding someone that noone will
  miss. Due to the sects feeding and breeding habits, the Sabbat
  has been totally wiped out.
  <h2>
   Garou
  </h2>
  The only garou in Newtonia are a sept of bone
  gnawers who managed to persuade the Biologists that they were
  worth preserving. After much begging and scraping, they preserved
  their cairn; although, it was shifted to the janitors' lunchroom
  of The Great Hall, where the sept is now employed. All of the
  other garou were too proud to try such a surrender, and died
  trying to protect their cairns. Garou visiting from outside will
  find the place very disturbing, and hopelessly calcified by the
  weaver, but they will not be persecuted if they are not causing
  trouble.
  <h2>
   Unscientific Mages
  </h2>
  Visiting mages will be confered with
  the status of 'tribals'. Dreamspeaker and Virtual Adept mages
  will have the most difficulties. Newtonia is more attuned with
  the shadowlands, than the near Umbra, and the computers of the
  Virtual Adepts are quite vulgar. SoE mages will fit right in with
  society, but there may be paradigm clashes with local reality.
  Marauders who do not indulge in luddism, or don't disrupt orderly
  society are tolerated; otherwise, they are dealt with like any
  other rogue mage. The Nephandi were destroyed.
  <p>
   NOTE: Because the sleepers know what Scientists do, and they
  actively support the Scientific paradigm, and mold static reality
  to strengthen the Scientists, the Scientists can ride roughshod
  over all perceived enemies of Ascension.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Newtonia's Darker Side (This is the WoD,
  afterall)
  </h2>
  Newtonia is stagnant. Only the inability of anyone
  else to interfere on the Scientists home turf keeps out the
  enemies. If the trail that the Scientists are blazing to
  Ascension doesn't get there soon enough, the velvet glove will
  peel off of the mailed fist. When Newtonia's opponents can
  overcome her security, Newtonia will disintegrate faster than
  Socialist Romania. I have described Newtonia in its summer.
  <h2>
   Interesting Inhabitants:
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Professor Emeritas Otto Van Heeswyjk
  </h3>
  This small
  inoffensive little man appears to be a marauder, but is really an
  oracle of Spirit. He is affectionately known as "Uncle Otto", and
  the sleepers view him as an intercessionary figure between them
  and God (the sleepers of Newtonia are predominantly protestant
  christians). He does not visit Newtonia often, but he arrives to
  either meet interesting new people, or to preside over trials of
  capital crimes. Anyone who attacks him must counter his sheild, a
  forces/correspondence/life/matter/mind/prime spirit/time/entropy
  effect that preemptively strikes entities that direct harmful
  effects his way with hostile intent from anywhere (even through
  the gauntlet) that removes all of their weaponry, strips them of
  any quintessence, and reduces then to incapacitated with
  aggravated damage. The effect is coincidental, with six
  successes, that does (per success) four levels of damage and
  steals three points of gnosis/blood/quint, as appropriate and
  removes all clothing, non-talisman posessions, teeth, and nails.
  Talismans lose three points of quintessence per success. Garou
  also lose one point of rage per success. Only the first seven
  points of unsoaked damage are applied. The effect is coincidental
  due to sleeper belief in Otto's powers. If encountered outside of
  the court and not attacked, Otto will babble meaninglessly, at 10
  arete he is too disjoint from reality, nod politely, do something
  nice in an incomprehensible fashion for unfathomable reasons, and
  then depart.
  <h3>
   Sherlock Holmes (call a spade, a spade)
  </h3>
  A tribal of high
  repute who helps solve all manner of crimes. He is a cultist of
  Ecstasy with arete 5, and at least one pip of each sphere.
  Sherlock has at least mind 3, time 2, correspondence 2, to enable
  him to look about crime scene and determine what happened, by
  whom, and why.(I wish I had my notes with me).
  <h3>
   Arthur Trvithick
  </h3>
  A Customs Officer, Arthur is unawakened,
  but aware. He derives significant pleasure by making mages
  respect his authority. His high willpower makes him immune to the
  veil, and almost impossible to dominate. Majesty improves his
  efficiency, not his temperment.
  <h2>
   Game Effects:
  </h2>
  The Gauntlet between Newtonia and the Near
  Umbra is 9 in the cities and towns, and 8 elsewhere (5 in the
  janitors' lunchroom of The Great Hall). Linking with the shadow
  lands is difficulty 7 and is otherwise treated like the near
  umbra.
  <p>
   Technomancy based on the Bohr atom, the photoelectric effect,
  special and general relativity, probability waves, particle wave
  duality, Heisenburg uncertainty, the strong nuclear force, the
  weak nuclear force, any subatomic particle besides electrons, and
  alot of other things that I can't think of offhand are all
  vulgar. Most technocracy talismans will cease to work when
  imported into Newtonia, unless infused with quintessence, and
  they have the minimum arete necessary to perform their function.
  The following is a short, and definitely not exhaustive, list of
  these talismans: digital watches (time1), video cameras
  (time2,corr2, forces2 with TV), and everything else with at least
  one transistor. Any use of these devices will garner paradox.
  </p>
  <p>
   For a visitor's magick to be coincidental, it must be within
  the mage's paradigm, and Newtonia's governing paradigm (the most
  fascinating interactions in my wife's campaign revolved around
  trying to figure out what was coincidental in the region that the
  players were in).
