  <h1>
   The Pyramid

  <h2>
   The Realm of an Oracle of Prime
  </h2>
  <i>
   by Anders Sandberg
  </i>
  <h2>
   Physical Description
  </h2>
  The Realm is an immense pyramid,
  stretching from an unknown base at the foundations of Reality
  towards an apex immeasurably high in the highest aethyrs. It is
  mainly built out of indestructible black stone, smooth as glass
  and silently humming with withheld power, and perfect crystal
  shining with the flow of Quintessence. Inside are great rooms
  with walls of crystal, endless galleries, labyrinthine hallways
  and stairs leading endlessly up. The hallways are dark, most
  light come from irregularly spaced lanterns or glowing
  inscriptions in the walls; many of the inhabitants carry (or
  make) their own light. Outside the walls what looks like a
  perpetual storm rages; it is in fact the chaos of the unshaped
  reality of the Deep Umbra, and several times abominations from
  Beyond have attacked the Pyramid, but so far the forces of the
  Oracle have defeated them.
  <p>
   The deepest levels are dark and unexplored, and few of the
  inhabitants of the realm venture there. Higher up, the walls of
  the labyrinth are covered with inlaid patterns of silver and
  gold, arabesques and cosmic secrets written in unknown languages.
  More and more crystal appears in the walls, forming titanic
  windows in the inhabited areas or huge pillars rising through
  several levels. The furnishings are sparse, and usually both
  simple and subtly luxurious. As one moves towards the apex,
  reality becomes more fluid and abstract, and the pyramid become
  more and more pure Quintessence. Nobody has ever seen the apex
  itself, except possibly for the Oracle.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Realm is sustained by an immense flow of Quintessence. The
  Will of the Oracle seems to draw it from all of reality, and as
  it flows up through the pyramid it becomes more and more
  concentrated. The walls are filled with its flow, and from time
  to time they discharge themselves into resonant harmonics echoing
  through the entire realm. Higher up the Quintessence is so
  powerful that anything anybody thinks will become real; only the
  most extreme self-discipline can prevent the dark sides of a
  person from rising up and destroying him. It is widely believed
  that the Oracle resides in the node at the apex, bathing in pure
  Quintessence.
  </p>
  <p>
   The paradigm within this realm quite naturally allows
  extremely powerful magick; the only way to attract paradox is by
  invoking it yourself (or theoretically: by successfully breaking
  against the Will of the Oracle). Since there is an abundance of
  Quintessence, pattern magick requires no Prime component and
  talismans work extremely well. There are a few restrictions:
  Correspondence can only affect levels lower than the Mage; it is
  impossible to scry or teleport towards the top of the pyramid.
  This also includes other forms of perception-magick. The stone
  and crystal of the pyramid is impermeable to spirits of all
  kinds, and the only way to enter (or leave) the realm is by the
  silent admission of the Oracle. This also serves as a very
  powerful defense against the beings of the Deep Umbra. Time
  within the realm is somewhat indeterminate; it is more or less
  optional. It is almost impossible (even with magick) to keep
  track of time, it just passes with no effect.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Oracle
  </h2>
  Nobody has ever seen the Oracle, but every
  entity in the realm feels his/her/its presence at all times - in
  this realm existence itself is an extension of the Will of the
  Oracle. The Oracle resides at the highest levels of the Pyramid,
  but not even the highest Postulants are allowed to go there. Some
  Postulants have theorized that the reason for this is that the
  Oracle wishes to avoid being defined by the perceptions of other
  beings, and exists in a state of potential existence rather than
  actual existence. Others claim the Oracle is so far beyond
  humanity that it cannot be perceived at all.
  <p>
   The only people who normally interact with the Oracle on a
  regular basis are the four Postulants of the innermost circle,
  who sometimes visit places near the apex. It has happened that
  the Oracle has communicated with others directly, a most bizarre
  experience: suddenly reality itself around the person is a
  message, and he will instinctively know what the Oracle wishes to
  tell him (in the same way that we know our own existence). The
  Oracle seems to be aware of almost everything that goes on in the
  Realm, and can actively influence it.
  </p>
  <p>
   Exactly what goals the Oracle has is also a complete mystery.
  It is thought that the Oracle studies the interplay between
  paradox and Quintessence, possibly to unite them into new forms
  of reality never seen before. Not even the Postulants of the
  inner circle know for sure.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Postulants
  </h2>
  The Postulants of the realm are divided
  into the outer circle, the middle circle and the inner circle.
  The Postulants of the outer circle have been accepted as
  students, and study for the Postulants of the middle circle. As
  they advance in understanding of reality itself, they gradually
  move up in the ranks until they become members of the middle
  circle. The middle circle teaches the Postulants of the outer
  circle and study the deepest secrets of reality. Members of the
  middle circle are rarely promoted into the inner circle by the
  Oracle; suddenly the Postulant is a member of the inner circle
  without any explanation. Right now there are four members of the
  inner circle.
  <p>
   To become a Postulant at the Pyramid a mage has to be accepted
  by a tutor, usually a member of the middle circle but rarely a
  member of the inner circle. The tutor is expected to teach the
  mage, but the mage is also expected to assist the tutor in all
  ways (something which can prove very dangerous; more than one
  lesser Postulant is known to have been destroyed when he made a
  mistake with the powers his tutor controlled). Study is usually a
  mixture of experimentation and demonstrations of profound
  magicks. It is said that no book have ever succeeded in holding
  the sheer power of Prime at this level, so the highest mysteries
  have never been written down in the tomes of the libraries. Most
  of the Postulants of the outer circle spend much time studying
  all the manifestations of Quintessence and the different kinds of
  being they form. Later they move on to study Paradox and reality
  itself.
  </p>
  <p>
   Even the least of the Postulants is a tremendously powerful
  mage. They have left their traditions and the Ascension War
  behind them to pursue their quest for ultimate knowledge and
  power. Some are driven by an inner need to know, a burning desire
  to understand reality itself. Others were originally seeking to
  use the power of Prime for their own ends (or even to seek
  Oraclehood themselves), but have become enraptured with its
  beauty. Many of the postulants have an intense thirst for
  knowledge of all kinds, and also study the highest levels of
  other spheres. Some are quite different from humanity by now;
  many do not eat or drink, they rely on the flow of quintessence
  within the realm to replenish them, and some have spent years in
  concentrated meditation.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Acolytes
  </h2>
  There are a few acolytes within the realm,
  themselves mages of power but far beneath the skill and power of
  the Postulants. Some hope to one day become Postulants
  themselves, while others content themselves with studying the
  lesser mysteries or keeping the realm working. While the entire
  realm runs itself on the large scale thanks to the Oracle, there
  are many lesser jobs which needs to be done such as defense,
  library work and guidance which cannot be left for the Servants
  of Reality.
  <h2>
   The Servants of Reality
  </h2>
  The Oracle has created servants
  to deal with most practical needs. These servants are never seen,
  and only exist when doing their tasks - they are no more than
  extensions of reality, a kind of great coincidental magick doing
  everything. If a person wishes to eat, a plate of food will be
  quietly put on his table in the corner of his eye, and when he is
  finished the plate will vanish when he isn't looking. The
  servants can do everything a mortal servant can do, and a great
  deal more - they always know what a mage wishes, always find
  their way around the pyramid perfectly and never disturb anything
  they shouldn't.
  <h2>
   The Powers That Be
  </h2>
  There are rumors about greater
  servants of the Oracle residing in the high chambers, the
  personal servants and guardians of the Oracle. These beings,
  usually called The Powers That Be, are eternally watching the
  entire realm for any sign of disturbance or attack. They are
  immensely powerful, probably more powerful than even the
  Postulants of the Inner Circle, and have near total control over
  the reality of the realm (within the bounds of the Will of the
  Oracle, of course). Just like the Oracle and the Servants of
  Reality they have never been seen or even perceived.
  <h2>
   Hans Valdemar Gr√ºnewald, Postulant of the Inner
  Circle
  </h2>
  Hans has no past - he deliberately erased all memories
  of his previous existence when he was accepted as a Postulant to
  fully devote himself to his new duty. Few other Postulants have
  been so ambitious or downright ruthless as Hans, and he is
  generally feared by all beneath him. While he can be generous
  towards others, he is his own sharpest critic and will not accept
  any form of weakness in himself. He has purged everything he
  perceives as weak within himself, and constantly watches himself
  for new flaws to correct.
  <p>
   Hans is obsessed with Paradox and its properties. He often
  visits the physical world or other realms to witness paradox
  storms and major backlashes, and he has traveled the Umbra to
  seek out the Marauders in their lairs. A few times he has
  appeared to other mages falsely claiming to be an Oracle (rumor
  has it that the real Oracle is displeased with this). So far his
  research has led to the discovery of several previously unknown
  forms of paradox and a limited ability to control its
  manifestations (this is extremely dangerous, and Hans nearly
  destroyed himself when he attempted to turn paradox itself into
  material form; only the intervention of the Oracle saved
  him).
  </p>
  <p>
   Hans is a striking figure, surrounded with an intense aura of
  leadership and devotion. His clothes are woven of fluid reality,
  changing appearance depending on the viewer but always impressive
  and symbolic of his power. His long hair is black as the abyss
  and his eyes are filled with a gleam harder than diamond;
  something about his appearance gives the impression that it has
  been artificially perfected, or rather simplified and
  strengthened. Due to his study of paradox, he always talks in
  riddles and contradictions, never revealing his true intentions
  or visions despite that he hides them within his speech.
  </p>
  <p>
   Of the Postulants of the inner circle, Hans is ironically the
  most approachable. While he is a strict person and hard to
  understand, he still has some ties left to humanity unlike the
  others. According to some of the other Postulants he is the
  youngest and most ambitious of the inner circle, but this is
  uncertain.
  </p>
  <h2>
   <a name="Ibrahim">
    Postulant of the Inner Circle: Ibrahim
  Gazi
   </a>
  </h2>
  Ibrahim grew up in Morocco during the height of the
  Arab empire, second son to a royal astrologer. Already as a child
  he learned many secrets about the heavens, and often accompanied
  his father to the rooftop during the night, silently taking notes
  of the positions of the stars his father called out. One day an
  old man visited the family, a mystic from a remote land. Ibrahim
  listened to the conversations between his father and the mystic,
  and that night he had a terrifying and awesome dream: he was no
  longer a boy, but an endlessly growing arabesque, growing ever
  greater into infinity.
  <p>
   Suddenly he remembered the holy Quran, and recited "To God
  belong the East and the West; whithersoever you turn, there is
  the Face of God; God is All-embracing, All-knowing." And he saw
  that infinity was really his center, and that all was one. When
  he awakened and told his dream to his father and the mystic both
  smiled. The mystic said: "Truly, Allah has blessed you with a son
  destined for greatness, just as the stars foretold." he said and
  turned to Ibrahim, "You will be known by many names and in many
  places, but foremost you will know yourself".
  </p>
  <p>
   Ibrahim studied the teachings his sufi teacher taught him, and
  when he had surpassed him he studied under his teacher's teacher
  until he surpassed him too, and taught them instead. When he was
  named Qutb, he carried the heavy burden with happiness, because
  he saw the truth behind it. However, during his pilgrimage to the
  holy city of Mecca he felt something calling to him. Above the
  Qabah he saw a glimpse of an immense pyramid, a pure geometric
  shape reflecting Mount Qaf. "Not yet, but in the time Allah
  wishes" he whispered to himself and kissed the black stone.
  </p>
  <p>
   It was not until he was over 90 years old he felt he could
  give his responsibilities over to his students. He left his home
  city for the mountains, where he fasted and danced to purify
  himself before his great journey. After ten days and nights, he
  lightly danced into the air and vanished. After another ten days
  and nights, he danced into a huge hallway of pure crystal and
  collapsed on the floor, filled with the ecstasy of
  exhaustion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ibrahim became a Postulant, and slowly advanced into the inner
  circle. Despite the immense knowledge and power he has amassed,
  he is still a man of faith and humor. He has more and more turned
  inwards, since he has deeply realized that the reality we see
  outside ourselves is just a mirror of our inner reality, and vice
  versa. Most of the time he spends silently meditating in one of
  the high chambers or dancing through the hallways made of reality
  itself, seeking the dance which will take him to the unity at the
  apex.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ibrahim is a very old man, physically very frail but
  spiritually a pillar of strength. He dresses simply in a dusty
  grey robe. He never speaks, preferring to show things directly
  instead.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Resonance
  </h2>
  Power is a tangible thing in this realm. Not
  mere mundane power, but power over reality at its deepest levels.
  Everything is filled with it, and it is clearly visible; it is
  impossible to hide who is greater and who is lesser. Hierarchy
  isn't that important, only power itself (but remember that
  knowledge is power too). When a mage rises in power, he will also
  rise in the hierarchy automatically (this requires no outside
  recognition, reality itself advances the mage). Unlike Doisstep,
  advancement at any price is not the goal, the true goal is
  ultimate power and knowledge, something everybody within the
  realm seek or feel the urge to seek.
  <h2>
   Theme
  </h2>
  The theme of this Realm is Power and Secrets. The
  Oracle is the personification of immense power, a godlike
  presence omnipresent in the realm, but still invisible like its
  unseen servants. The Postulants are enmeshed in games of
  apprentice-masterhood and the pursuit of knowledge and power,
  each hiding a great secret from the others. The inscriptions of
  the walls proclaim unknown things, and nobody (except possibly
  the Oracle) knows where the labyrinth beneath leads. Anybody
  living in this realm soon become obsessed with learning things,
  to find out what is truly going on and use it to advance to the
  apex of the pyramid.
