You are welcome.  Here's two rote I came up with
Banishment of the Disgusting Vermin (Mind 2)
A Order of Hermes mage was having a great deal of trouble with 
cockroaches.  To get rid of them, he developed this rote.  Using Mind 
2, he convinced the cockroaches to go bother the Progenitor living 
across the street and two doors down.  

Shoo! Shoo! (Life 3)
A Progenitor mage was having a great deal of trouble with cockroaches.  
So, he used Life to make them all go and bother the Order of Hermes 
mage across the street and two door up.
