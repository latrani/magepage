     The Rosicrucians are not a tradition, but a camp inside the Order
  of Hermes. After the failure during the middle ages of the false
  order, the Order was shaken to its foundations. Many mages simply
  left to other traditions or founded their own small groups. Many
  claimed that the failure was due to excessive contact with the
  mundane world, and retreated into pure study.
     <p>
      The Rosicrucians were a more radical camp of the order. They
  claimed the failure was not due to the contact with mundanes, but
  due to the fact that they had initiated almost anybody into the
  false order. This led to the appearance of diabolists,
  power-hungry or destructive mages. The Rosicrucians wanted to
  continue to spread the hermetic ideas among the sleepers, but now
  only to the "worthy", who could handle them. During the period of
  1500-1600 the Rosicrucians organized themselves, slowly preparing
  for their grand plan. They allied themselves with some
  Ahl-I-Batin sects, and exchanged information with them.
     </p>
     <p>
      To avoid the Technomancers they had invented a trick: to hide
  in the open. Their idea was to create as many false orders as
  possible, to confuse and annoy the Technomancers. In 1615 they
  publicised "
      <i>
       Fama Fraternitatis
      </i>
      " and "
      <i>
       Confessio
  fraternitatis Roseae Crucis, ad eruditos Europae
      </i>
      ", two
  manifestos revealing their existence and some of their powers.
  They also contained a request to all the learned men in Europe to
  join them in their quest. Of course this lead to a lot of noise.
  The Traditions were furious. The technomancers were furious. The
  learned and not-so-learned men was curious, and wanted to join.
  Exactly what the Rosicrucians had planned.
     </p>
     <p>
      Soon a lot of people was searching for the elusive
  Rosicrucians. Learned men was writing their own books about them,
  subtly pointing out that the author was a very wise man and
  certainly a prospective member. Some people mistook these books
  for secret messages from the Rosicrucians themselves, and began
  to believe that the author was one of them. Others were writing
  texts condemning rosicrucianism, and after a while there was
  hundreds of manifestos, books and texts about the Rosicrucians.
  The Rosicrucians were quiet. Soon there began to start
  rosicrucian orders all around Europe. Secret societies began to
  flourish, and the Rosicrucians (the real ones) silently took
  control over some groups, using them as bases of operations. The
  Technomancers simply couldn't stop them, because for every
  genuine order there was hundreds of copycats, and most of them
  was secret.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Rosicrucian movement evolved. Today they are the secret
  masters of several Masonic groups and a lot of different secret
  societies. And they continually start new groups and movements.
  Using these as a front, they initiate the "worthy" into the
  secrets. Often they do not make them into full mages, preferring
  to diffuse their enlightenment into society. The orders are a
  very useful place to find new candidates for membership. They
  also try to contact as many powerful and wealthy patrons as
  possible, to protect themselves and expand the orders even
  more.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Technomancers are powerless against all these secret
  groups. They can't eradicate them, since that would be very
  suspicious, and they contain too many influential people. They
  instead try to infiltrate them or subverting them in order to
  stop the Rosicrucians. The Rosicrucians counter by creating even
  more new groups, and luring the technomancers into traps. Whole
  groups are faked, just to fool them into doing something stupid.
  The technomancers try to discredit the groups, hoping to erode
  their enemies power base. They also start new groups themselves,
  hoping to lure the Rosicrucians to try to take them over, and
  then catching the infiltrators. This secret war have been raging
  among the secret societies for several centuries, and there are
  no indications of an end. Everyone is tangled up in a web of
  intrigue, and paranoia is rampant among all involved.
     </p>
     <p>
      <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu:8001/usr/sk4p/occult/misc/gd-faq">
       The Hermetic Order of The Golden Dawn
      </a>
      was one of their most
  successful fronts. It initiated people in plain sight.
  Unfortunately it split up because of internal strife (and
  possible technomancer infiltration). This created a lot of new
  orders, some which evolved away from the Rosicrucians. Aleister
  Crowley used methods both from the Rosicrucians and the Cult of
  Ecstasy (to the Rosicrucians dismay). The splinter groups have
  influenced a lot of other groups, like wicca, chaos magic and
  lots and lots of "real" Golden Dawn orders. This has both helped
  the Rosicrucians, as there are now even more groups to hide in,
  but the unorthodox hermetics that have evolved are an source for
  embarrassment.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Rosicrucians have amassed more mundane power and wealth
  than any other group in the Order of Hermes. Through the charity
  trusts they control through different Masonic groups, they can
  put pressure on banks and invest money as they wish. Many
  powerful and important persons are members in their far flung new
  of lodges and orders. Some of their groups function as traps,
  where the Rosicrucians collect people they gather incriminating
  evidence against for use as blackmail. By financial
  manipulations, political pressure and lots of contacts, the
  Rosicrucians are a force to be reconed with.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Rosicrucians are the undisputed masters of subtle intrigue
  together with the Ahl-I-Batin (who taught them the basics). Their
  extremely complex plots have however an unfortunate tendency to
  unravel when confronted with reality, causing the participants to
  stumble in the confusing dark. Its not uncommon for their agents
  to believe they are working for the other side, or even that they
  are double agents. Some are double agents, turning the
  Rosicrucians ever more paranoid. The war against the Technocracy
  agents and lodges have become more and more absurd, with every
  participant desperately trying to stay on top while all the time
  trying to sort information from disinformation.
     </p>
     <p>
      One area the Rosicrucians excel in is cryptography. The
  hermetic mindset, combined with their paranoia, have made them
  masters of secret communication. Beside obvious codes, they have
  developed hidden coded which are encoded into art, normal text or
  completely unexpected things like interior decoration or
  gardening. One common way hiding messages is to use symbols and
  references which are only meaningful for a Rosicrucian of high
  enough rank (this serves to hide important information from
  members of low rank).
     </p>
     <p>
      Beside the more common conspiracy-oriented Rosicrucians there
  are more withdrawn members who spend their time helping Sleepers
  in need. These trace their origin back to a small group of
  survivors of the fall of the false Order, who wished to atone for
  their pride by helping people with their magick. They have
  continued their work, protected and aided by the conspirators.
  They sometimes use alchemical methods, but prefer to avoid
  suspicion by posing as physicians. However, one of their strict
  rules is to never accept any payment for their work, since true
  healing should be free for all in need. The healer Rosicrucians
  are supported by most of the Order of Hermes, especially the
  Alchemists and Cabalists. The conspiracy-oriented Rosicrucians
  support the healers with donations, protection and information,
  while they themselves use the healers as a kind of PR for the
  sub-tradition.
     </p>
     <h2>
      Philosophy
     </h2>
     Mankind must Ascend, but is hindered by its
  ignorance, malice and greed. We must prepare the way in secrecy,
  initiating the worthy into the mysteries and spreading the
  enlightenment into the world. This must be done in secrecy, lest
  our enemies will find and destroy us. As long as we hide among
  our imitators we are safe. In order to guard our secrets, we must
  reveal them.
     <h2>
      Organization
     </h2>
     The Rosicrucian order are tightly organized
  into smaller orders, but the different orders have little
  contact. This have led to incidents where two orders have begun
  to fight each other, without realising who the enemy was. The
  orders are organized into grades of initiation. Each member have
  a grade, and is not allowed to learn the secrets of the higher
  grades until he is initiated into it. The initiations are complex
  rituals, wherein the candidate is instructed into the mysteries,
  the secret passwords and handshakes. The grades below are an
  example, based on the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, one of
  their most successful front orders.
     <ul>
      <li>
       <b>
        Probationer
       </b>
       A candidate for membership, but not a
    mage yet. Many are acolytes.
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        Neophyte
       </b>
       The candidate is initiated and awakened. He
    is instructed and remain in this grade until he has mastered
    Forces 1.
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        Zelator, Theoricus, Practicus, Philosophus
       </b>
       These
    four grades represent the elements Earth, Air, Water and Fire.
    The initiate learn to control the lesser forces. When the mage
    has mastered a force he may be initiated to the next
    grade.
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        Adeptus Minor, Adeptus Major
       </b>
       and
       <b>
        Adeptus
    Exemptus
       </b>
       These grades are for those who have reached forces
    3.
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        Magus
       </b>
       and
       <b>
        Magister Templii
       </b>
       The mage now have
    power over the greater forces. Adepts of Forces. Many mages of
    these grades control different secret societies for the main
    order.
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        Ipissimus.
       </b>
       Now the mage is a Master of the forces,
    and often allowed to create his own order.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h2>
      Meetings
     </h2>
     Mainly the four equinoxes and each full moon.
  Different orders have quite different schedules, often rather
  similar to lodge meetings of masonic orders. These meetings are
  rather ceremonial, but after the solemn part most groups have
  dinner and discuss less important or mundane matters.
     <h2>
      Initiation
     </h2>
     Varies among the orders. A typical initiation
  consists of an elaborate Masonic-looking ritual, wherein the
  initiate is led around the temple and presented with different
  symbols, guardians and must answer questions and swear oaths.
  After a long and tiring time, during which the suspense has been
  slowly built up, the initiate is unexpectedly shocked in some
  way, which will (hopefully) awaken his avatar. Often the initiate
  will have some sort of vision of the avatar.
     <h2>
      Chantry
     </h2>
     Vienna is the site of the oldest chantry, an old
  manor. This chantry is one of the most influential Hermetic
  chantries in Europe. It is officially owned by the fraternal
  order Ordo Rosae Crucis (to be secret, you have to obvious). Most
  Rosicrucians reside or have ties to Hermetic chantries, or run
  their own chantries disguised as secret societies or Masonic
  orders.
     <h2>
      Acolytes
     </h2>
     Freemasons, members of secret organizations,
  illuminati fans, nurses.
     <h2>
      Sphere
     </h2>
     Forces is the main sphere, having great symbolic
  importance. Different subgroups concentrate on Mind, Life or
  Prime depending on philosophy and need. Mind is popular among the
  conspirators, who use it both to manipulate people and to protect
  themselves. Life is common among the healers, who specialize in
  caring for the sick and needy. Prime is studied mainly by the
  more mystic members, who see it as the link to true Ascension.
     <p>
      Views of the Spheres:
     </p>
     <dl>
      <dt class="c1">
       Correspondence
      </dt>
      <dd>
       Everything in the world is tied to everything else through
    symbolic links. By following these links (using the wisdom of
    Tradition), a mage can see the connections between
    superficially disparate things. He can also use this knowledge
    to manipulate the connections, bringing objects closer or
    farther, or even transporting himself along the network.
      </dd>
      <dt class="c1">
       Entropy
      </dt>
      <dd>
       Decay and dissolutions are a sad fact of our fallen world.
    A mage must fight these to purify the world again and bring it
    closer to Ascension. This sphere gives the necessary power, but
    is also a great temptation for the unwary.
      </dd>
      <dt class="c1">
       Forces
      </dt>
      <dd>
       The whole universe is created by the interplay between
    different forces. When two opposed forces meet, they create
    something new. When Light meet Darkness, shades appear. Fire
    and Water destroy each other, yet they transmute matter by
    their battle.
      </dd>
      <dt class="c1">
       Life
      </dt>
      <dd>
       The living world is filled with organization and beauty. By
    learning to see the secret order underlying everything alive, a
    mage can heal the sick and wounded by restoring the forces and
    structures to equilibrium. This is one of the most noble uses
    of magick, and to use this Sphere to disrupt or unduly
    transmute living beings is an affront to all sensibility.
      </dd>
      <dt class="c1">
       Matter
      </dt>
      <dd>
       Matter is composed of forces which have been woven into
    stable patterns. It is an inert sphere, forming the floor of
    the Temple of Ascension but lacking the power to rise upwards.
    Matter is easily controlled using the lower forces, and is a
    mighty servant if used properly, but a heavy burden if
    misused.
      </dd>
      <dt class="c1">
       Mind
      </dt>
      <dd>
       The forces of the Mind are subtle and powerful.
    Unenlightened minds are filled with chaos, stray thoughts and
    battling emotions. The Enlightened ones can control these
    forces, and hone them into mighty tools for Ascension.
      </dd>
      <dt class="c1">
       Prime
      </dt>
      <dd>
       This is the highest force, the force which ties the
    Universe together. It is the light from the Fiat of the Great
    Architect of the Universe. To understand it is necessary for
    all works of higher magick.
      </dd>
      <dt class="c1">
       Spirit
      </dt>
      <dd>
       The spiritual world represent a higher world, where the
    true symbols of reality exist. By learning to rise to higher
    planes, a mage can find deep truths and see the great Work
    clearer. But beware of the treacherous and capricious beings
    from the Abyss, they only seek to trick and do harm.
      </dd>
      <dt class="c1">
       Time
      </dt>
      <dd>
       Everything that happens are but a part in the great chains
    of destiny. By learning how these links work, a diligent mage
    can follow their paths backwards and divine their future ways.
    But Destiny is a most powerful force, and attempting to change
    it will bring down hideous danger.
      </dd>
     </dl>
     <h2>
      Foci
     </h2>
     Often the same as the Order of Hermes, but sometimes
  they use a wand, a sword, a cup and a pentacle instead of the
  Seal of Solomon. Which foci is used depend upon the type of
  magick they want to perform, as related to the four elements. A
  fireball would use the wand, while a invisibility spell would use
  the sword.
     <p>
      <b>
       The Wand
      </b>
      is used for fire and destructive magic. Most
  often used for higher forces. It is often red, with inscriptions
  in hebrew or Latin.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       The Sword
      </b>
      is for air, light and electricity. Sometimes
  used for Mind, lesser forces and Correspondence. Often an
  elaborate ceremonial sword, or perhaps a dagger.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       The Cup
      </b>
      for water, emotional and life magic. Often made
  of silver, with complex inscriptions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       The Pentacle
      </b>
      (a disk with a pentagram on, or a shield
  or a coin) is used for earth, matter and stability.

      secret societies, use their own secret codes and try to take
      over the world "For the best of Mankind". Where have we seen

       Rotes
      </a>
     </h2>
     <h3>
      The Middle Pillar Ritual (Prime 2)
     </h3>
     This rote has been
  developed from a Cabalist exercise, and became very popular in
  the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. It will strengthen the
  body, mind and soul of the mage. The mage stands and vizualises
  himself as the middle pillar of the Sephirothic Tree. Below him
  is the material world, and above his head Keter, the source of
  prime. He feels the energy flowing through him, into the world
  and from the world back to the source. The mage will feel filled
  with power, in perfect balance of mind and body.
     <br>
      [ The mage will pump quintessence into his own pattern for a
  while. This will temporary strengthen the mages own pattern and
  hopefully weaken intruding patterns. Each success will remove one
  success of magick (Both helpful and harmful), like a
  countermagick roll. The target number for the rote is the highest
  sphere involved in the effect + 3, or 5, whichever is highest. It
  will not heal any damage already done nor stop any flaws in the
  mages own pattern. Prolonged use of this rote have been shown to
  cause egocentricity, as the mage unconsciously begin to believe
  he is the centrum of the universe. ]
      <h3>
       The Rose-Cross Ritual (Mind 2)
      </h3>
      This rote consists of the
  mage drawing six celtic crosses with an incense-stick in to the
  East, South, West, North, Up and Down. The lines traced in the
  air will form a protective sphere, which will make people
  overlook the mage. People around the mage will ignore him and
  will not remember him very well, if at all. They will not think
  about the mage if he does not attract attention.
      <br>
       [ The rote will make people overlook the mage. Three successes
  are enough to be ignored by all people in the vicinity of the
  mage. Each success will subtract one die from every perception
  roll to spot the mage, as long as he does not attract attention.
  Since most people ignore each other anyway, the mage will in
  effect be almost invisible]
       <h3>
        Detect Disinformation (Mind 1 Entropy 1, often Correspondence
  3 and/or Time 2)
       </h3>
       Many Rosicrucians are paranoid about
  information they receive, and seek to test it to see if it is
  disinformation or lies. This rote was developed by a group of
  especially worried mages, who were barraged by subtle
  disinformation from the Technocracy. They studied the information
  in the mental image of their showstones, invoking Mikael and
  other angels of truth to help them to find falsehoods and lies.
  By seeking internal inconsistencies, they managed to ascertain
  some of the validity. This method was later developed into a very
  efficient rote by adding Correspondence and Time. The mage not
  only studies the internal consistency of the information, he also
  compares it to the causal chains and actual state of the world.
  This might take a long time if it is complex information or
  relates to very specific matters, so the use is somewhat limited.
  However, even a brief check can reveal some types of
  disinformation.
       <br>
        <h3>
         Tritheimus Mental Meeting (Mind 3 Correspondence 2)
        </h3>
        This
  rote was used in earlier times to keep the leaders of the
  Rosicrucians in touch. The participants gaze into the showstones
  at a specific time, and seek the minds of their fellow mages
  while naming the angels of communication (as described by
  Tritheimus). They will communicate semi-telepatically, making it
  very hard for outsiders to listen in on the conversation. Today
  this rote has fallen into disuse due to paradox and modern
  communications, but many traditionalists still use it. Another
  group have adopted a variant borrowed from the vampiric Tremere,
  which merges the minds of the participants over large distances.
  The result is said to be a form of brain-washing, where the
  participants become more loyal to the overall organization. Most
  Rosicrucians think this use is too dangerous.
        <h3>
         The Lesser Pentagram Banishing (Spirit 2)
        </h3>
        This is another
  adapted Cabalist rote. The mage performs the Cabalist Cross,
  draws protective pentagrams in the four directions and then stand
  with his arms straight out to the sides, so that his body forms a
  cross. He invokes the four Archangels: "
        <i>
         Before me Raphael.
  Behind me Gabriel. On my right hand, Michael. On my left hand,
  Uriel. For around me flames the pentagram, and within me shines
  the six-rayed star
        </i>
        ." By using this rote, the mage will scare
  away most spirits, fearful for the powerful Archangels and the
  powerful mage.
        <br>
         [ The Archangels will normally not appear in person, but will (if
  the mage is lucky) send subordinates to the mage. They will not
  manifest physically, but their presence is often felt. The
  subordinate angels will scare away lesser beings from the
  vicinity. After they are done, they will report back to their
  superiors what happened. It is very unwise to misuse this rote.]
         <h3>
          Test the Traitor (Mind 3 Entropy 1, sometimes Time
  2)
         </h3>
         This rote is used to test initiates of the Tradition to
  see if they are possible traitors. It is often used during the
  initiation ceremony just as the initiate is shocked or is busy
  concentrating on something else, since the psychological defenses
  will be weaker. The users (often several older Rosicrucians
  working together in secret) tries to find weak points in the
  devotion to the Rosicrucian ideals and possible treasonous
  thoughts. They watch the mind of the person with their
  showstones, comparing it to the purity of their seals. The mages
  also use Time if they can, to see if there is any chance the
  tested person will become susceptible to such ideas or have been
  subjected to them.
         <h3>
          Sphere of Truth (Forces 3 Mind 2 Prime 2)
         </h3>
         This rote is
  used by the Rosicrucians at tribunals and trials to test if
  someone tells the truth or speaks with true conviction about
  something. The user of the rote draw a symbol above the Showstone
  using the seal, while chanting the twelve secret names of Truth.
  From inside the showstone a small sphere of vibrating, dancing
  light emerges. It can be handled, and while held in the palm it
  will change color, size and shape depending on the bearers state
  of mind and what he says. If he lies, the sphere will become
  darker, stained and begin to vibrate with a eerie sound. If the
  bearer tells the truth it will become brighter. If the bearer
  talks with true conviction and tells the truth it will jump up
  and down, glittering with intense colors depending on mood.
         <h3>
          Oath (Mind 3/4 Correspondence 2 Prime 3 Matter
  2/3)
         </h3>
         Another way of keeping their members loyal is the
  binding oaths used by the Rosicrucians. When a initiate swears
  his Neophyte Oath, this rote is used in some lodges. It creates a
  link between the oath, the mage and a material object (sometimes
  a drop of the initiates blood, or his signature or a symbol
  fashioned during the ceremony). If the initiate ever breaks the
  oath, the link will shatter causing some kind of change in the
  material object (the blood will burn, the signature fade or the
  symbol shatter). By using more powerful mental magick, the link
  can remind the mage of his duty if he ever thinks something
  contrary to the oath. Some groups have developed a more fearsome
  version, which will attack the oathbreaker (often using Forces,
  Life or Spirit, depending on the casters).
         <h3>
          Deep Programming (Mind 4 Prime 2, sometimes Spirit 2)
         </h3>
         The
  mage enters the mind of a person (often while the person is
  asleep or in trance) and reprograms it in secret. The most common
  use is to place suggestions or ideas into the subconscious, where
  they will trickle to the surface. Other possibilities are deep
  hypnotic suggestions giving the mage control over the actions or
  thoughts of the victim, mental blocks of certain memories,
  placing "trapdoors" which will give the mage a way around mental
  defenses or even the creation of full-fledged sub-personalities.
  The last use, often called Invocation of Thelemic Beings, is
  sometimes combined with Spirit too. Such sub-minds will be
  independent from the main mind, and may influence it, read its
  thoughs or do other things on a mental level, as programmed by
  the mage. This is a subtle way to sneak around enemy mental
  scanning.
