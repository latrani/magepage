Popular Television Shows In The World Of Darkness;
--------------------------------------------------------------

     The World of Darkness, although it parallels our own world,
there are subtle differences that help make the place weird
sometimes, completely alien the next. Television and television
shows should be no exception. So here are a few television shows
that flow over the airwaves in the World of Darkness;

---------------------------------------------------------------
Sci-Fi/Space Drama
---------------------------------------------------------------

SpaceTreck; The Next Regeneration (tm)
SpaceTreck; Deep SPace X (tm)
SpaceTreck; Voyages (tm)

Outward Appearance;
This trio of television shows is on the surface a nice little
"sci-fi" show that depicts the exploits of a group of do-gooders
in space. They travel from planet to planet, exploring, finding
new things, and for the most part exterminating aliens (if they
don't look human that is). The "lucky" aliens that are close to
human form or "intelligence" are accepted into the "United
Brotherhood of Planets", but they still do not share the status
or acceptance that their human "brothers" do. The show is loaded
with "Technical Jargon" and flashy special effects. 

The "Reality";
This show is one way that the $yndicate is making a public image
for Void Engineers, hell you can even buy a rudimentary bi-
corder (tm) now that will tell a person a few vital signs. By
making the technical jargon mainstream, and showing that "Space
Travel can be possible by the methods that they use in the show".
Slowly the procedures that are used by the Void Engineers become
more and more coincidental. As a side effect, the show helps
spark interest in the Convention, producing a larger pool of
people that have a basis in the reality that the Void Engineers
work for. At the current time there are large groups of "Spacies"
that have large conventions. dress up as their favorite Space
Treck character (Like the lovable wacky android Lt. Datum, or the
dashing second in command Will Richter!), and buy overpriced
merchandise. Again some VE's pick recruits from these semi-
enlightened masses. 

As a side note, Pentex has noticed the popularity of the show in
the 10-18 year old demographic, and has started to produce cheap
knock off toys that are infested with banes and the sort of usual
evil dreck. They also have plans of producing their own sorts of
shows on their television network (PNB) aka Penumbral National
Broadcasts network. Look for such fine shows as;

Captain Hansom vs the evil forces of W.O.L.F.
The Chemical Avenger
Attack of the Killer Vegetables
etc.......

----------------------------------------------------------------
Police Drama/Real Life Tales;
----------------------------------------------------------------

P.O.L.I.C.E.
The Government's Most Wanted
Real Tales of the Highway Patrol
Savior 911

Outward Appearance;
These "Live-Action" cop shows are filled with "real-life" police
action. Every week they show the trials and tribulations of the
Peace Officers of our country. Whether it be the dashing highway
patrol or just a couple of rank and file beat cops that bring
justice and order to the cold dark streets. Through these shows
the masses get a good look at the criminals that populate our
world, and the good and brave men that bring them to justice. 

The "Reality";
A picture is flashed across the screen, "this man is wanted by
the united states government for over 15 counts of armed robbery,
rape, and murder. If you have any information, concerning this
individual's where-abouts, there is a reward of $100,000 for
information that leads to his arrest. Be warned that this man is
armed and dangerous." well, the picture was that of a mage, a
mage that the NWO wanted for questioning. What happens? Well it
is a great cover for an entropy coincidental effect don't you
think? Someone in all of those millions of viewer will know
something.....and when they call, they will find them and bring
them in. There is a second, more dangerous effect at hand here.
Some of these shows have subliminal messages imbedded in them,
messages like;

"if you know anyone 'weird' or 'showing supernatural powers' you
will turn them in to us, call the number at the bottom of the
screen, tell the person on the other end everything that you
know, then hang up and forget that you did this."

or other similar messages.

Being the evil and devious person that I am, you can weave this
into a correspondence/mind effect, sort of mass mind control,
hell you can have the NWO build this massive broadcasting device
(that coincidentally looks just like a big satellite dish) that
is a Techno-talisman that produces the above effect. 

----------------------------------------------------------------
Game Shows;
----------------------------------------------------------------

The Price is Right (I am frightened by this show as it is)
Family Rumble
Universal Gladiators ($yndicate in with the Progenetors)
Wheel of Wealth (Had to take any occult significance out of this)
Trivial Masters

Outward Appearances;
Nice people winning ever nicer stuff; Right? 
Well that is what you see every day, people winning prizes
because they know the price of dish soap is less than $5.95,
because they know what the "man on the street" would say when
polled over a stupid question, because they have "superior"
bodies, because they can guess some stupid letter puzzle, or
because they know some little fact.

The "Reality";
Remind you of something?
"Sit.....roll over.....beg.....good dog, here is a doggie bone."
That is right, we are being trained through our televisions to
uphold the power of wealth and material goods, everyday the
masses bow down before the temple of materialism and pray to
their god....the all mighty buck. Yes this is the work of the
$yndicate (Big surprise there!) just another way that they are
re-shaping the paradigm of the world to fit their end-goal.

Again Pentex is creeping a tentacle hold in here, as they also
promote these types of shows because they promote greed and envy,
two emotions that the wyrm is very fond of.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Well that is all that I can think of right now, there may be a
part two to this, or even a part three + if everybody likes this.
Let me know, again all criticism/comments more than welcome.

Real-life cop dramas (continued).

Police Stop!
Terror in the Streets

     These real-life police shows demonstrate the 'incredible stupidity' 
and 'real-time footage' of various traffic offenses and vandalism and 
urban riot situations, showing advanced 'traffic camera' and 'helicopter
surveillance' of criminals being apprehended by the police. 
     As the increasing expense in NWO surveillance systems to keep track 
of the Awakened enemy started to add weight to certain Sleeper beliefs 
(assisted by the Virtual Adepts) that a dystopia similar to that of Orwell's 1984 was coming into effect, the Technocracy's agenda faced a new challenge. The Sleepers were beginning to question regulations and social manipulation
through new fashions was becoming less and less effective.  A Syndicate 
marketer hit upon the cunning idea that 'real-life' drama would hold the
interest of the Masses more than the latest contrived cyber-fantasy used to
justify the automaton excesses of Iteration X and some of the more vulgar
actions of the Progenitors.  Footage from the surveillance tapes (Q-film and
Kirlian celluloid) were renamed light-intensified or IR film) 
Not only did the Masses identify with the real-life dramas, adopting more 
trusting attitudes to authority figures in uniform, this also stifled the 
imagination.  After all police dramas are easy to believe.  Shows involving 
'the supernatural' and creative thought were 'weird' or 'too complicated'.
The Syndicate gained an increase in market share and the NWO gained possible 
coincidental Correspondence Sensing against 'criminal' reality deviants. 
Riot footage and violence is the screening of Homo Superior/Victor assaults 
on Tradition acolytes or weak mages.  After all, the easiest place to hide 
these atrocities is in plain view...

The Z-Conspiracy
       This show details the quest for truth from two 'Government agents' 
againsta morass of supernatural and extraterrestrial beings, supported by 
cabals or individuals who shelter, sympathise or try to manipulate these 
beings.  Popular due to the good looks of the stars, the gritty 'real' feel
that comes from a well-produced low-budget series and the use of Dimensional Science tech as well as retouched footage from Technomancer Shock Corps and
Border Defence Corps mission tapes (cool special effects!), the agents move
along a labyrinthine series of events against shadowy enemies.
      The agents are portrayed in a sympathetic light and the show is full 
of justifiable explanations for strange events, an almost 'how-to' for any 
Technomancer coincidental magick.  They profile the abduction of people by 
extraterrestrials as a frightening process, using the initially sympathetic
curiosity of one of the agents to make the inevitable hostility of said 
supernatural that more chilling.  A vaguely subversive element has appeared
in recent scripts, it is suspected that a Virtual Adept is hacking the 
scriptwriters.

Until we speak again, think happy thoughts...;-)

"Bleak Shadows"

Outward Appearance:
A long-running supernatural afternoon soap opera, detailing the travails
of Barabas Collinsworth, a vampire who returns from his 200-year
imprisonment to seek an end to his vampiric existance with his descendants
in decadent Collinsworth, Mass. Over the years of its run, he would be
joined by his distant cousin Matthew, a (stereotypical movie) werewolf,
who is also seeking a cure, several ghosts and hauntings, the occasional
black mage, and Barabas' tormentor and Sire, Jacqueline. 

The "Reality":
Enough to make a vampire vomit or a Garou gag, this program was noted for
its over the top scripts and acting, its stereotypical representation of
the occult, and its low-budget, cheesy production values. Many times the
actors would be seen crashing into a phony tree, which would collapse, or
a microphone or stagehand would be seen on camera. The scene where
Barabas' phony fangs fly out of his mouth during a long rant is highly
prized by its fans. Still, it is fondly remembered by a legion of devoted
fans. It also has subtle undertone that the supernatural is really -BAD-
and should be avoided at all costs.


"The Bionic Man"

Outward Appearance:
Fighter pilot Colonel Steve Houston, severely wounded in combat, has his
right arm, eye, and both legs enhanced with cybernetic replacements. Now
he performs crucial undercover work for the Scientific Investigations
Office in the name of freedom, combating alien invaders, mad scientists,
robots, Bigfoot, and other strange enemies of the United States and
freedom. When his childhood sweetheart was critically injured in a car
crash, the SIO gave her bionic limbs and hearing, and she works alongside
him on occasion, until she died heroically saving the world from a nuclear
threat.

The "Reality":
The Progenitors want in on the media, too, being envious of the Void
Engineers. This is also subtly indoctrinating the masses to accept bionics
and other super-scientific wonders in the present age. Of course, it might
do better if the actor who plays Houston could actually -act-: he
sometimes seems more robotic than his opponents. It was because his
co-star -could- act, and well, that she was written out after working two
years on the series.


"Dodge City"
"Wagon Trails"
"Oklahoma Territory"

Outward Appearance:
The Western, an old Hollywood tradition. "Where daring men and women
pushed back the frontier of the Old West." Stories of the legendary
lawmen, daring outlaws, and just plain folks on the American frontier. To
a generation who grew up on Saturday morning western serials, these shows
are a welcome reminder of the true spirit of America.

The "Reality":
The re-inforcement of the negative values of the old West: the power of
the gun, the subjugation of Native Americans (witness the stereotypical
depictions: the Noble Savage, the Hot-headed Young Brave, the Fallen
Injin) and the destruction of their way of living, the exploitation of the
Western lands (not to mention the destruction of Garou cairns and
corruption of nodes). 


"Exposed!"

Outward Appearance:
A muck-racking program, led by well-known media celebrity Hidalgo Riviera,
which focuses on frauds, con games, phony psychics and healers, fake
gurus, and coverups. Wherever the public is being deceived, "Exposed!" is
there to uncover the truth!

The "Reality":
Funny how this program never exposes any of the Syndicate's rackets, but
always finds something dirty in a Celestial Chorus storefront soup
kitchen. And Heaven help any Mage they find using his powers publicly:
there are enough counter-mages on their staff that they can convince any
audiene that the subject's powers or claims are frauds. The fact is, this
is a nothing more than an attack on anything threatening to the
Technocracy, with a few manufactured expose's thrown in to bolster its
image. They also sponsor an 800 number for people to report frauds and
fakes, and take special effort to investigate anyone who appears to
manifest magickal or psychic powers.\

Popular Television Shows in the World of Darkness Part 2
---------------------------------------------------------

Hello again, here are some more Shows that I have thought up, 
have fun with them (I have tried to add in some more story hooks,
etc in them)

---------------------------------------------------------
Talk Shows
---------------------------------------------------------

The Jeremy Jones Show
Hopera Winnifred (Just Hopera)
Carrnie Windsong 
Late Night with Doug Alphabet
(The list is endless........just pick one)

Outward Appearences;
      A housewife turns her T.V. on in the afternoon, waiting for
her laundry to finish, she sits down and begins to watch the
Jeremy Jones Show. For the next hour, she is confronted with what
she would call 'freaks'. Today's show is about a group of teen-
agers that are dressed up in black ripped clothes. All of them
wear nose-rings and such, the one girl wears a rock-and-roll tee-
shirt that is ripped and patched with black electrical tape. They
call themselves "goths"......'disgusting' she thinks as she gawks
at the kids. 'kids today, they are like monsters, not like when
we were growing up' she mutters. Jeremy, a clean-cut young man,
berates them when they begin to discuss what they do on a given
night, free sex, drugs, and smatterings of witch-craft fills the
roster. One of the group, which calls itself 'the hollow ones'
leaves, stomping off the stage....'can't take the heat, ya young
punk?' she thinks. Ooops, her laundry is done, time to get back
to work.

The "Reality";
      Public Opinion shapes the paradigm. Talk shows help shape
(or establish) the public opinion. Or so is the belief of the
$yndicate. Want to harm someone's paradigm, tie it in with some
weirdo's and parade them in front of an audience of millions.
Again the Wyrm raises it's ugly head here, using talk shows to
berate victims of crimes (as in the 7th Generation in Rage Across
New York...for WereWolf) and to spawn it's own kind of PR. 
      Have the Player's chantry or hangout pictured as a haunted
house, have a player that like to use fire effects in a vulgar
manner, have one of the local talk-shows do a show on people
touched by the "whatever arsonist's" crime spree. Make it hit
home. If the (Insert Technocracy Convention Name Here) wants them
bad enough, or has enough info on them (Read NWO/$yndicate) they
can have the people that are speaking out give a decent
discriprion of the mage. The use of this type of thing can be
almost limitless, have fun with it, but don't over-use it, save
it for you want to annoy the PC's, or you have some down time
between stories.     

----------------------------------------------------------------
Action/Adventure
----------------------------------------------------------------

The Jones' (Based on the Smiths, a new spy show)
Beach Watch
Temporal Leap
Ocean Quest DSX (Deep Sea X-ploration)
10 Billion Dollar Man 2.0

Outward Appearences;
     The above three shows have lots of good looking people doing
daring things. They are filled with lots of good action,
explosions, secret spy action, perfect looking human bodies, good
ole' high-teck science, and all that jazz. These shows get people
excited and interested in all that sort of stuff. Most of the
plot lines fall around the usual basis progression, usually the
tried and true.

The "Reality";
     Well the NWO is sponcering The Jones'
     The Progeneitors have Beach Watch
     Iteration X has The 10 Billion Dollar Man 2.0
     and the Void Engineers have Temporal Leap and Ocean Quest.
     
Yes you guessed it, more propaganda for the Conventions. Again
they use this, as they do most television to shape the paradigm
of the masses, allowing themselves to operate their "proceedures"
with ease. With the advent of the spy show, the view of the spy
has become more and more romantic, we identify with the spy more
than the people that they are spying one (even if that be your
own country, corporation, etc) Also the little "spy gagets" that
are used, filter though the paradigm and allow things like "oil
slick cars" and "Tack dispensors" a concidental thing. Pen guns
(That is shooting someone with a regular bick pen, and using that
as a focus) have found there way into popular culture, etc, This
all makes the NWO's job much easier. The Progenitors sponser
(through the $yndicate) the shows that show the sculptured and
physicaly "superior" humans on them (and they also supply most of
the actors for these shows) making it easier for them to make
larger, stronger, fitter, clones that will not attract as much
paradox. Slowly they make room for the perfect humans in the
paradigm. Shows like Temporal Leap, and the Space Treck shows
(mentioned in part one) help bring the Void Engineers paradigm
into line with the rest of reality. Being the hardest (besides
Iteration X) to assimilate (Although the Cy-Borg on the Space
Treck shows, allies of the Brotherhood of Planets are, also
helping in this) into the current reality, they need all the help
that thay can get. Ocean Quest helps out the Engineers that
explore the oceans, helping them show their paradigm. All and all
these shows are bringing about a fast change for the Techno's. As
the popularity of these shows, and ones like them grow, they will
find it easier and easier to do "weirder" effects as coincidence.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Children's Shows/Cartoons
----------------------------------------------------------------

Barnaby
Mr. Mysto and the Mystic Circus
Captain Wallaby
Secret Agent X and the Cyborg Cops
etc.......

Outward Appearences;
     Happy happy children's television shows. Big pink dinosaurs
that spread happiness and cheer, A little puppet man that does
the neatest tricks, a jolly old man that teaches kids how to be
"nice" and "pleasent", and a smart secret agent that battle
against the secret society of W.O.L.F. These are the types of
programs that fill the air-waves of saturday mornings and weekday
afternoons. 

The "Reality";
     There are two main factions here, both battling for control
of this powerfull section of the masses. On one front the
technocracy ($yndicate) wants control over the very lucrative toy
markets, as well as the commercial aspects of the Children's
shows. The NWO is finding that they are a great way to "re-
program" the next generation of the masses. On the second front
is the Wyrm/Pentex/7th Generation/Etc. Pentex has control of many
of the worlds Children's television conglomerates. They use the
shows as ways of spawning violence, apathy, and hatred in the
younger memembers of society. The subsidiary toy sales are both a
good way to generate funds, as well as spread banes throughout
the children. (Read Book of the Wyrm for bane infested toys!)
Game connections can be many, perhaps the players find out what
the techno's or Pentex are doing and set out to stop them one way
or another. Or a child that one of the players has a connection
to, gets into the "grasp" of the wyrm through one of these shows
and or toys. 
 
     
-Well that is it for now,
-Thanks goes out to all of you that sent me positive respoce on
the first one, I appreciate it.

P.S. if there is any interest, I have a long (60,000+ bytes long)
chantry write-up that I am using as the basis of my on-going
chronicle in NYC (yes I am a part of that cross-game chronicle)
If any one is interested I can post it to the list.

-Eric

A great post, but you don't really have to discribe every show for your 
players.  I try to make do with the "mood" of the shows, how they are 
different then ours.
In my version of the WoD no one fraction conpletely dominates any one 
network and few entire TV shows.  To work so openly invites another faction 
to oppose you.  So on your typical show most of the people would be mundane, 
a scriptwritter or two working for one faction, a producer for another, 
maybe the director for still a third.  Sometimes they unknowly work 
together.  (eg both the Technocracy and the Camarilla want to keep the 
masses from believing in the Supernatual so might cooperate on such a 
show.)  This keeps the players from being hit over the head by the message 
but gives a more insidious creep to the various messages.
But supernaturals don't completely dominate the shows.  Public reaction and 
a need for profit are responsable for most of the programming as the 
networks catter to the lowest common demonator. (Lower in the WoD then 
here.  Scary isn't it?)
Here a look at how I handle it.  Feel free to use any of it (remembering to 
credit it to "some guy who posted it on the net" :)) or to ignore the 
entire post.

Soap Operas
Worst then those in the real world.  Domestic violence weeves its way 
through may of the shows and it's not always condemed (a minor victory for 
the Wyrm).  Characters will vanish and the other characters will say little 
about it (many of the factions like it when people are prepared to except 
sudden disappearences).  Plots tend to be darker, focusing on sexual and 
racial steriotypes to keep people afraid of different seeming people.

Kids Shows.
Take a look at those old "Little Rascals" shows with a PC view point.  Leave 
in the slap stick and racism and you have a typical WoD kids show.  Theses 
shows, either focused around kids or directed to a children's audience, tend 
to fall into one of two catogories.

A) Adults in charge:  The kids spend the episode trying to out smart the 
adults or unraval adult plots only to be told at the end that they've failed 
or didn't understand what was going on.  Parents (and other adults) are 
always right and children shouldn't poke their noises where they don't 
belong.  Often hints (or more than hints) of justified corporal punishment 
are sprinkled throughout the show (specially at the "You're wrong!" 
endings).  The Technocracy likes enforcing the big brother is always right 
message, the Wyrm enjoys encouraging abuse, while the Kindred love how 
curiousity is met with failure or a reasonable explaination.

B) KIDS RULE!!!!  The kids are always right as they take charge and torment 
or thrort the stupid, mean adults.  Take "Home Alone" and mix it the old 
Twisted Sister video "We're not gona take it" and you'll have a good idea 
about these shows.  They show kids taking charge and risks.  They teach how 
you shouldn't listen to you parents (encourage the brakedown of the 
family), that you should ignore your teachers (and drop out of school), and 
to be disrespectful of all authority (encouraging youth violence).  The 
Technocracy uses them to make youth seem an enemy, the Wyrm enjoys the 
chaos, and the Kindred maintain a nice supply of uneducated, unemployed 
teenages.  The Kindred also love the message that YOU the child should 
invesigate any weird goings on by yourself rather than telling an adult.  It'
s much easier to handle a vampire hunting child (who probably doesn't have 
the upper body strength to stake you quickly) then its parents.

Game Shows.
More humilating then in RL.  Ever see the SCTV sketch "Poor People doing 
WHACKY things for MONEY?"  Think along those lines.  "The Price is Right" 
never got on the air because "True or Consenquences" is still going strong.  
Chance is emphanized so people will belive money comes from being lucky.

Comendy.
The lowest common denominator drives this field.  Many shows go for shock 
value, pushing as far as they can to insult for a laugh [See note on V-
Chip].  Minorities, the poor, the stupid rich, all serve as the butt of 
jokes.  Most of these shows are seen by the various supernaturals as bread 
and circuses but, as with soap operas, other ideas creep in.
	Take the most offensive comedy shows you've seen and make them worst 
to get the base line for the WoD.  Take the implied family violence 
from old shows like the Honey Mooner ("I'll fly you to the moon.") and 
update it for a new generation.  Make it so it's fun to laugh at anyone 
different.  Enforce the steriotypes.  Milk humilation for laughs.  Include 
jokes about kids "getting it" complete with pillows to sit on.  Mix the 
views of the Technocracy, the Kindred, and the Wyrm.  Throw in some views 
from the other factions, and you've got a typical WoD comedy line up.  [In 
my world the current top comedy show is a remake of "The Honey Mooners" (
which started about the same time "Bless this House" did in RL) with the 
wife dominating it.  The Black Fluries, so sure they've won a victory, haven'
t noticed the other elements (dosmestic violence, possible backlass, 
enforced steriotypes, etc).]

Cop Shows.
These come in a wide range.
a) Black and white versions of good and bad.  The cops are right, the crooks 
bad.  Give throw in car chases, bloody shooting, and fight scenes.  Re-
enforces the idea that it's bad to leave your own part of town.  Helps 
people to accept the high crime rate.  Encourages people to report 
everything to their friendly police.
b) Good cops in a corrupt system.  Sometimes the focus is even on the bad 
cops.  The Technocracy doesn't really like this view but other factions do.  
While some of the nicer factions support this to warn people not to trust 
the system the Kindred and the Wyrm enjoys how it re-enforces the idea that 
currupt cops are no big deal.  Everyone takes a little hush money (or nose 
candy, or a free ride from a working girl, or (insert bribe)) now and then.
c) Renagaides taking the law into their own hands.  Think Death Wish, the 
series.  Helps to increase urban violence as fed up people take the law into 
their own hands.  Vigelantti group, like s modren day KKK, enforcing their 
view of right and wrong as the justice system stands helpless.

News.
The real battle ground.  Kindred will try to quietly kill stories, as will 
the Technocracy and Pentex.  Some Mages and Gurous want other stories to 
air.  And it's live TV.  Many of the decision makers are control by one side 
or the other.  Reporters are dominated, charmed, emspelled, blackmailed, and 
otherwise interferred with.  In theory the deepest plant on the set can be 
the news reader, brainwashed, dominated, or whatever to ignore a certain 
news story as it is displayed on the reader.  As most news readers would be 
fired the first time they did this only the truly desperate uses the reader 
to censor the news.
The voilence level shown is much higher then we'd allow, but it's a much 
voilenter world.  Anything that titilates is pushed in the climb for 
ratings.  For example if a local strip club is raided the black dots and 
bars might slip around a bit.


V-Chip: The Coming wave.
In the WoD the V-chip's arrival will be worst then here.  While the networks 
are publically putting the "power to choose" in the hands of the people they 
are actually resolving themselves of the responsability of keeping 
objectional programming from the home.  [A real life aside: Anyone else 
think prime time will be filled by shows that most V-Chip settings will 
block?]  In the WoD the situation is worst as the networks are taking the up 
coming V-Chip as license to put on shows they think they need to compete 
with cable.  Worst, many of the early V-Chips will be defective (part of a 
Wyrm plot to expose children to adult TV combinned with the supernatural 
hacker types (VAs, Glasswalkers, etc) who believe information wants to be 
free.  Of course there will be millions of old TVs without V-Chips still 
around.
	Some ideas WoD excutives are considing will hit the top of the V-
Chip settings.  The Technocracy want to increase the blood and guts levels 
of some cop shows so to better act as a deterant.  Money hungry groups 
are looking for more (as are the mundaine investors) as the Technocracy want 
to rebuild and concenstrate the power of the Networks, in keeping with their 
plans for controlling the masses.  The Wyrm's minion's are pushing in 
this direction as well.  Most of the things that will generate ratings are 
based on negative emotions that will feed it well.
	Some soaps are thinking about adding simulated (and realistic 
looking) rapes to their line ups, as well as pumpping the sex to almost 
pornographic levels.  Violence may be increased to level of some cop shows 
and vulgar language added.
	Kids shows will now have captive audiences as the V-Chip will block 
most other shows.  The slap stick may get a little harder, the humor 
crueler, but nothing to trigger a higher rating.
	Game shows will soon add a bit of nudity (to help compete with 
the soaps) and more vulgarity will be allowed (eg contests screaming 'I F***
ing won!').
	Comedy shows will take the chip settings to the max.  Think about 
the Dice Man getting his own show and doing his brand of humor.  The family 
violence getting a bit more realistic.  The steriotyping including 
vulgar words to discribe each group.  Instead of making a joke a bout a kid "
getting it" up the violence rating slightly and show it.  When the 
embarrassed guys walks in on the nude lady give the audience a peak.  Push 
comedy far beyond the limit and see how ratings go.
	Cop shows will have much more violence, a bit (or a lot, depending 
on demorgraphics) more sex and nudity, more vulgarity.  Druggies will be 
seen shooting up and crimes shown in graphic details.  All drving 
home the message that it's not safe out there so stick with your own type 
and report anything susicious to the cops NOW before it kills you.
	News shows will be immune from ratings.  If you don't know what the 
news will be how can you rate it?  More blood and guts will be shown.  More 
sex and nudity.  And if a story shouldn't be told 'actidently' broadcast the 
maximum V-Chip settings while it's aired.  A little error that should allow 
the news to be better controlled for at least the first year.
Humm...
Seemed to have gone on for a bit longer then I intended.  Well, if anybody 
likes these ideas don't hesitite to use them.  Let me know if you have any 
comments, via e-mail even if you don't feel like posting.
