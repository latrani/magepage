  <h1>
   Certamen
  </h1>
  <i>
   by Anders Sandberg
  </i>
  <p>
   The rules described for certamen in the Book of Shadows are
  complex, dramatic, imaginative - and very unusable. They require
  Adepts of all spheres to inscribe the certamen circle, and the
  presence of an Adept of Prime for the actual fight. Such
  concentrations of magickal skills are rare today, and it seems
  likely that they were not that common even during the mythical
  era. When mages met in the past, they could not travel far to
  possibly hostile chantries to settle their differences. And it
  would appear even more unlikely that a highly elaborate system of
  certamen would be used by all mages.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is an attempt to revise the system, to make it more
  usable.
  </p>
  <h1>
   Certamen
  </h1>
  There are two main forms of certamen, the
  competition and the struggle (certamen proper and contentio).
  Competition was mainly used to establish the occult pecking order
  by demonstrating who was the most skilled and powerful mage,
  while the struggle was a direct magickal duel between the
  opponents about more serious matters.
  <p>
   It should be noted that certamen duels are largely a thing of
  the past outside the greater chantries. Today most mages are more
  desperate, and important differences are far too often settled in
  other, more final ways.
  </p>
  <p>
   Certamen is most popular among the Order of Hermes (who often
  elaborate it into mystical rituals), the Akashic Brotherhood, the
  Verbena and the Dreamspeakers. The Virtual Adepts and Sons of
  Ether have their own versions like Core Wars or the Battles of
  Science in the Gernsback Continuum, while the Cult of Ecstasy and
  Euthanatos usually regard the whole thing as a waste of energy.
  The Technocracy of course has strict prohibitions against this
  kind of frivolity, which might undermine the internal security of
  the Union.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Competition (Certamen Proper)
  </h2>
  In the competition, the
  challenged mage begins by creating a magickal effect. The
  challenger then has to outdo him, either by greater power, skill
  or style. The competition continues until one mage is unable to
  perform a greater feat of magick. In chantries, it was common
  (and often demanded) to have an impartial judge who judged whose
  magick was the most impressive, but among mages in general the
  competition went on until one mage realised that he was beaten.
  Quite often the place of the certamen was regulated by chantry
  rules, to minimize the risks to the chantry or non-combattants.
  <p>
   The magick has to use the same or higher levels of spheres as
  last time, decreasing the power is generally regarded as failure
  unless it is done very stylishly. Style is important, especially
  if the mages are closely matched. Coincidental effects are often
  regarded as a bit unworthy if the opponent uses vulgar magick,
  but sometimes a clever coincidence can decide a competition.
  </p>
  <h3>
   System
  </h3>
  The challenged mage performs a magickal act. The
  challenger then has to do a comparable act that gains more
  successes than the challenged, who then has to outdo him and so
  on. He must use spheres at the same level or higher than his
  opponent. If he continues on the same level, he can either create
  a new effect, hoping to overcome the successes of the other, or
  empower his previous effect perceptibly (as long as the previous
  successes + the new are greater than the opponent's things are
  going well). Moving up to the next level of the spheres do not
  require the mage to gain more successes as the opponent, as long
  as the result is perceptibly more advanced.
  <h3>
   Example
  </h3>
  Maria Placida of the Order of Hermes competes
  against Quintus Z of the Virtual Adepts. She begins by invoking a
  ball lightening (incidentally sending harmless but irritating
  static into the electronics of Quintus), Forces 3 Prime 2. She
  gains three successes and the ball fills the room with eerie
  glow. Quintus has to do an effect at least on level 3, and uses
  Correspondence 3 Forces 2 to bring in sunlight into the room. He
  gains three successes, and the ball lightening is outshined.
  Maria decides to scale up her effect, and gains another three
  successes to scale up the ball lightening to a roaring sphere.
  Quintus answers in the same way, and makes the sunlight blinding
  with another four successes. Maria, a bit worried about his skill
  in Forces uses Forces 4 to make the ball sweep out through the
  open window and set fire to an old tree outside, hoping to create
  a huge conflagration. She just gains two successes, singing the
  tree, but it is a higher sphere so she has not lost and Quintus
  now has to do something with a level 4 power. He decides to use
  Entropy 4 to turn the tree into dust (which would definitely be
  stylish and most likely end the struggle), but only manages one
  success - a small twig falls off. Maria laughs and mockingly asks
  "Is that all you can do, O Master of the Digital Web?".
  <h3>
   Variations
  </h3>
  Among hermetic mages the competition was
  common between apprentices, who loved to show off their powers to
  each other standing in a ring as a kind of game. When an
  apprentice failed, he left the ring and the others continued,
  until the most skilled remained.
  <p>
   The masters preferred a more abstract competition when they
  met, the competition of secrets. Instead of doing magick they
  revealed occult secrets to each other, trying to reveal a secret
  so great that the other was unable to beat it. In this way
  differences could be settled and information exchanged (or
  tricked away from secretive but unwary mages); the trick is to
  reveal the
   <i>
    right
   </i>
   secrets.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Struggle (Contentio)
  </h2>
  In the Struggle, the mages take
  turns interfering or manipulating the magick of each other. One
  mage creates an effect, and the other seeks to overcome it. This
  may be done directly, or in more "civilised" duels (called the
  philosophical struggle, Contentio Philosophus) symbolically: the
  mage shows an effect that
  <i>
   could
  </i>
  have defeated the effect,
  for example turning into a wolf when the other had turned into a
  cat. Unlike the Competition the winner is usually decided by raw
  occult strength.
  <p>
   There have been numerous certamina of this kind that has ended
  in the death of one of the participants, either deliberately or
  accidentally. Sometimes the struggle turns into a real, dirty
  magickal fight; this has made many chantries outlaw direct
  struggles. By tradition the defeated mage is forced to grant the
  winner one service, usually determined beforehand.
  </p>
  <p>
   Interesting enough, this form of certamen has caught on among
  the spirits of the Western Court, possibly due to knighted
  Masters from the Order of Hermes. Some spirits may be summoned
  for a certamen; either the mage wins and can demand a service, or
  the spirit wins and can demand something (this can range from a
  tasty mouse to eat over a knight of Quintessence to the mage's
  firstborn child). A similar practice occurs among some of the
  more unwieldy spirits of the Middle Umbra which the Dreamspeakers
  have to deal with.
  </p>
  <h3>
   System
  </h3>
  The mages have to create effects which defeat (or
  could defeat, in the philosophical struggle) the other's effect.
  The form of defeat may be direct (e.g. dissolving a pattern) or
  indirect, using the result of the effect (e.g. creating a cat to
  eat the mouse the other mage created). Direct effects require
  more successes than the effect (using a suitable combination of
  spheres, for example Prime 4, Entropy 3 or Forces 4 to destroy a
  block of metal). Indirect effects do not require as many
  successes, but must be able to defeat the other effect somehow
  (for example, Matter 2 to create acid or Life 3 Spirit 2 to
  summon goblin smiths to destroy the metal block). If the opponent
  defeats the effect, then the mage have to either admit defeat or
  create an effect to defeat the opponent's effect (such as a
  barrel of alkaline solution or a goblin-eating Snark to deal with
  the aforementioned effects).
  <h3>
   Example
  </h3>
  Ingiald Skald once trespassed onto the territory
  of Freya of Vardatr√§sk in his quest for the runes of
  Heimdallr. She challenged him to certamen; if he won she would
  tell him the secret of where to find the runes, if she won he
  would have to serve her for seven years. Ingiald threw his staff
  onto the ground, turning it into a snake (Matter 3 Life 3). Freya
  turned into a cat (Life 4) and killed the snake. Ingiald turned
  into a fierce wolf (Life 4), but Freya began to sing a
  sleep-giving galder-song (Mind 4, 2 successes) putting
  wolf-Ingiald to sleep (The rune-mage unfortunately lacked Mind to
  do countermagick with). As he awoke, he was fettered by iron
  chains and was forced to submit to serving Freya for seven years
  (but in the end, he tricked her into revealing where to find the
  runes).
  <h3>
   Variations
  </h3>
  A classic form of the struggle is when the
  mages turn into different forms, trying to find a form the foe
  cannot resist. This was especially popular among Verbena, and
  still is used among Marauders (although the mad mages are
  unlikely to follow the same rules as the opponent).
