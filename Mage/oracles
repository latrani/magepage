Congratulations, you still have the best Mage page on the web.

While reading various pages you have kindly published, I noticed a
discussion on the Oracles. The question is:

Why, if the technocracy is so bad, do the Oracles of the Traditions not
stop it? (figuring that thier are far more Tradition Oracles than
Technocratic ones. Personally, I don't think their are any Technocratic
Oracles)

Borrowing heavily from Judeo-Christian ethos, perhaps this the answer:

You need these "villains" to become an Ascend and become an Oracle. This
goes with the more Jewish (as opposed to Christian, particularly
Evangelical Protestantism) version of the Devil. The Satan in Jewish
Theology is more aptly termed "The opposer" or "Tempter." He (it?) is in
Angel (still working for God) who's job it is to test mankind. Perhaps the
Oracles feel the same way about the technocracy. The technocracy is to
oppose attempts by individuals to ascend, in the process, they make those
individuals who ascend much better for it. The Mage will fight and learn
through many lives until that Mage ascends. Eventually the technocracy will
war with itself until the last die hard technocrat ascends. If a mage fails
and is killed by the technocracy, reincarnation is expected until he
ascends. This is my campaigns answer to why "Oracles don't answer." This
makes the nephandi even worse in that they deny reincarnation to their
victims. It also makes the Magi thoughtful and sad about Marauders who
don't reincarnate as long as their madness (reality defying) continues.
