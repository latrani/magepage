   The Priestesses of Inanna
  </h1>
  <h5>
   A minor tradition

  <hr>
   Prostitution has not always been looked down upon as it is today.
  Once its practitioners were the priestesses of love and
  sensuality, celebrating the mysteries of sex at the temples of
  Inanna in ancient Sumer. Later the Babylonians worshipped her as
  Ishtar, the goddess of the morning star. Among the Hebrews she
  was known as Asherah, the wife of El. Other groups in the middle
  east gave her other names, but her worship was widespread. But as
  Christianity and monotheism rose, her worship was outlawed and
  she was demonized. She became known only as the demon Astaroth,
  and her priestesses were despised.
   <p>
    The origins of temple-prostitution date back to ancient Sumer.
  Inanna was the Goddess of the city Uruk, having brought the
  sacred laws (the
    <i>
     me
    </i>
    ) to the people there by stealing them
  from her grandfather Enki, the god of water and wisdom. She was
  the goddess of love, fertility and war, revered for her power and
  feared for her temper. She was said to have a rapacious appetite
  for men and didn't take "no" for an answer. Many myths tell about
  her revenges against lovers who refused her or people who treated
  her badly.
   </p>
   <p>
    She married the mortal shepherd Dumuzi, and made him king of
  Uruk. From their union the land prospered, and fertility ruled.
  Some time later, Inanna ventured down into the Realm of Death to
  visit her sister Ereshkigal, the goddess of the dead, perhaps
  hoping to learn the secrets of the Underworld too. But when she
  after three days re-emerged from death, she found Dumuzi carrying
  on as usual, happily celebrating. In her anger she let the demons
  of the Underworld take him down with them. But later grief
  overtook her, and appealed to her sister to release her husband.
  Ereshkigal allowed it, on the provision that the sister of Dumuzi
  took his place half of the year. So it came to pass that during
  late summer, autumn and early winter, Dumuzi is in the realm of
  death and no plants will grow. On the new years day, he is
  released and fertility and growth yet again returns to the land
  as Inanna rejoices.
   </p>
   <p>
    This is the origin of the sumerian New Year celebration, the
  hieros gamos, where the king ceremonially marries the priestess
  of Inanna. Their marriage and subsequent union recreates the
  marriage of Inanna and Dumuzi, giving fertility to the land and
  power to the king. This ceremony developed, and the priestesses
  of Inanna became sacred prostitutes, ensuring the fertility of
  the land by giving themselves to the worshippers. There were also
  male prostitutes, representing Dumuzi for the female
  followers.
   </p>
   <p>
    The cult spread with minor variations in the whole Middle
  East, and Inanna became known as Ishtar, Asherah, Aphrodite,
  Venus and by many other names. Her cult also became mixed with
  the cult of the Great Mother, and it is unclear where one ends
  and the other begins. In some areas all unmarried women had to
  serve at her temples a period each year, something was regarded
  as s privilege. The priestesses enjoyed high status, unlike most
  other women at the time. They may have been the origin of the
  well educated, intellectual courtesans which reached their height
  in classic Greece.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, with the coming of the new religions the cult of
  Inanna lost its status. It became outlawed, her temples were
  destroyed or appropriated by other groups and her followers were
  scattered for the winds. Prostitution remained, but was no longer
  sacred and was instead regarded as tainted by the followers of
  monotheism (partially because of its earlier association with the
  Goddess). However, small parts of the cult survived in remote
  areas or in India, where it developed under Hindu influences into
  Tantra. Today the classic cult is almost certainly dead, but
  followers may remain in odd places, mainly inside the Cult of
  Ecstasy.

   <h2>
    Philosophy
   </h2>
   "We bring fertility to not only the land, but
  to the wombs, the hearts and minds of the people. Our lady Inanna
  brought the wisdom and power of the Sky and Earth to us, and now
  its our duty to follow her in her footsteps. "
   <h2>
    Organisation
   </h2>
   Originally the priestesses belonged to their
  temples, which were run by the High Priestess, and sometimes some
  intermediary levels of priestesses. Male priests had their own
  hierarchy beside the female. As the cult withered away the strict
  organisation became more informal. Many priestesses were solitary
  practitioners of their arts, while others congregated together in
  small cliques.
   <h2>
    Meetings
   </h2>
   The original cult feasted at each new moon, but
  the main celebration was the New Year celebration, when the King
  married the Goddess to bring about fertility and the return of
  spring. Beside these there were many lesser feasts, not currently
  known. Many revolved around the movements of the morning star in
  the heavens.
   <h2>
    Initiation
   </h2>
   Not much is known about the original
  initiation ceremonies of the cult. It is believed that many of
  the priestesses were orphans which were given to the temple and
  fostered to their adult role. It is believed a major part of the
  initiation consisted of a ceremonial replay of the myth about
  Inanna, where the initiate had to go through the adventures of
  Inanna to become like her. She had to steal the sacred
   <i>
    me
   </i>
   from Enki and bring them to Uruk despite the monsters he sent
  after her. She was led through the courtship with Dumuzi,
  culminating in their marriage. Finally, she had to descend into
  the Underworld for three days and eventually triumphantly return
  to life.
   <h2>
    Chantry
   </h2>
   The main chantry was of course the "House of
  Heaven" in Uruk, currently a ruin in modern Warka, 250 km
  Southeast of Baghdad. Other temples existed in most major cities
  in Sumer and later the whole middle east. Today none of them
  remain.

   , mainly directed towards fertility
  magick. Most priestesses concentrated their magick completely
  towards Life. In order to use the other spheres, the priestesses
  usually invoked other deities or asked for help from their
  priests. Most common was the servant of Inanna, Ninshubur, the
  Queen of East, who controlled the powers of Forces and
  Correspondence. The water-god Enki gave wisdom and controlled
  Mind, Time and Matter. Dread Ereshkigal ruled over death, the
  underworld, Spirit and Entropy.

   <blockquote>
    "I Bathed for the wild bull,
    <br>
     I bathed for the shepherd Dumuzi,
     <br>
      I perfumed my sides with ointment,
      <br>
       I coated my mouth with sweet-smelling amber,
       <br>
        I painted my eyes with kohl.
        <br>
         <p>
          He shaped my loins with fair hands,
          <br>
           The shepherd Dumuzi filled my lap with cream and milk,
           <br>
            He stroked my pubic hair,
            <br>
             He watered my womb.
             <br>
              He laid his hands on my holy vulva,
              <br>
               He smoothed my black boat with cream,
               <br>
                He quickened my narrow boat with milk,
                <br>
                 He caressed me on the bed.
                 <br/>

          </br>
         </p>
         <p>
          Now I will caress my high priest on the bed,
          <br>
           I will caress the faithful shepherd Dumuzi,
           <br>
            I will caress his loins, the shepherdship of the land,
            <br>
             I will decree a sweet fate for him."

     Rotes
    </a>
   </h2>
   <h3>
    Bless Growth (Life 2)
   </h3>
   This is the most common rote ever
  used by the priestesses. By reciting the names of the plants,
  animals and people while making love to Dumuzi, they make them
  grow faster and become more fertile. The power of this rote is
  increased if it is performed with either the King (who is the
  personification of the land) or with a priest of Dumuzi.
   <h3>
    The Bull of Heaven (Life 3 Mind 2 Prime 2)
   </h3>
   When King
  Gilgamesh of Uruk spurned her advances, Inanna sent a frightful
  bull against him to destroy him. Her priestesses have learned how
  to turn ordinary animals into almost as dangerous weapons. By
  reciting the sacred
   <i>
    me
   </i>
   of Enki while bathing the bull in
  scented oils near a river, and then making love to it, they gave
  it enormous strength and anger against the enemies of the
  priestesses. Some have gone further and created animals out of
  clay which turn alive with the single purpose of destroying their
  enemies.
   <h3>
    Escape of Dumuzi (Life 4)
   </h3>
   According to the legend, Dumuzi
  managed to escape from the first attack of the demons of the
  Underworld as Inanna condemned him to death by turning his hands
  and feet into snakes, and thus escaping their grip. He escaped
  the second attack by turning his arms and legs into the legs of
  an gazelle, escaping them again. By reciting the invocation to
  the sun-god Utu Dumuzi is supposed to have used, a priestess can
  perform the same feats.
   <h3>
    Descent into the Underworld (Spirit 4 Entropy 2)
   </h3>
   This
  recreates Inanna's descent into the Underworld. The priestess
  ceremonially strips away her jewellery, her clothes and signs of
  power while reciting the "Descent of Inanna". Finally, she is
  completely naked and falls into a deep coma. In this state, the
  priestess can communicate with the spirits of the dead and see
  their realm. After three days she must be revived, or she will
  remain dead for real. However, this can only be done either if
  the priestess manages to return to life by herself or by the
  power of a full priest of Enki, sending out his servant spirits
  to fetch her soul back.
