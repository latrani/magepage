Subject: the Sally Rivers Show!
Content-Type: text/plain

The Sally Rivers Show:

The Appearance:
   A typical, ordinary,daytime talk show with a demographic skewed towards
out-of-work black people and poor white trash. Most of the shows are geared
towards incendiary topics to stimulate argument with the guests,audience and
professional
"experts"  The hostess of the program is of course a bubbly vivacious young
woman with no training, an occasional weight problem, a tendency to man-bash,
and a penchant for asking "have-you-stopped-beating- your-wife-yet?" questions.
   It's rude, It's crude, and It's rating are going through the roof....

The Reality:
    Sally Rivers is the result of a test marketing of "GET THIN" pills. they
were discontinued because the fomor that they were creating were wildly
unstable.
   Sally is one of the few success stories. She has a unique fomor power in
that she brings out the absolute worst qualities in people without becoming an
obvious target.
   The program airs on OMNI-TV and is begining to garner an insane amount of
the market share. The Program also acts as a platform for many books put out by
so-called self-help experts which actually are extremely damaging. Many of
these books are put out by Dawnbreak press.(a subsidiary of Vesuvius
Publishing)
   Many audience participants are dosed with minute amounts of Fomorach.(candy
given out before the show.) Guests on Sally's show usually alternate between,
paid actors,attention seeking weirdos, who will lie about anything to get on
T.V. and a few people with real serious problems.(these people usually go home
shattered or worse than before.)

Titles:
You made love to my sister and I want you out!
Bi-sexuals and the couples who love them.
My child looks like a freak!
My Parent looks like a freak!
You made love to my brother and I want you out!
I married a Homosexual!
Secret Crush
My girl is a slut!
My boy is a dog!
Young and Pregnant! (tied with Secret Crush for cause of most suicides.)
Safe Sex? I don't think so!
That's not my Child!
Strippers and their families.
I want to tell you off! (part 23)

Campaign Use: This is what I call a "drop-in"  Usually this show is one of
those things that is background noise in the World of Darkness. Hollow Ones
watch it for fun, Caitiff watch it to feel better about themselves. and its on
the T.V. at the house of any poor person that the characters visit. 
   This is one of those things that may never develop into an adventure at
all....However
if you've laid the groundwork, when the truth becomes known it should shock the
P.C.'s into action just by it's utter pervasiveness if not by it's sheer
insidious nature.
   It'll generally go like this, The characters befriend someone who likes the
show or maybe has a real problem. Maybe the N.P.C. is one of the assorted
hangers-on of a Hollow Ones cabal who's one of those aforementioned attention
seeking weirdo's.
    They go to the show, get dosed with fomorach(in minute increments) and
either go through withdrawal  or they go back to the show...over and over
again. Soon it becomes a problem as the Fomorach begins to twist them up
inside. Only characters
with hearts of stone will ignore this hideous transformation. Verbena will
usually go buck wild when they hear about this.
The show does have a Pentex First team providing security.
