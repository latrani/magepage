    Background:
   </b>
   Before awakening "Featherboy" (not his
  real name of course) was a Organic chemist. He was also
  interested in Virtual Reality, was always seeking an escape and
  fantasy, and he would go to great lengths to create elaborate
  fantasies and daydreams. A virtual world where he could escape
  the problems of his life. He had a serious accident some time
  ago, that left him in a coma. During the coma he had a wonderful
  dream, a dream that he awoke and had all the powers he had
  imagined he had. This was in fact his awakening, and he did
  eventually wake up. - though not in a hospital, his
  Correspondence saw to that. He still believes everything that
  happens to him is a dream or fantasy of his own subconscious'
  devising. He forgets this now and then, but when you are
  dreaming, you sometimes know when you are dreaming, and sometimes
  you do not. This Quiet made him, of course, a natural Marauder.
   <p>

    He varies his looks quite a lot, but he is
  always short with curly hair, usually gold or red. He often
  appears in Mundane society as wearing a coat of golden feathers.
  The feathers that come out from the coat are used in a form of
  magical shared hallucination called "Feathering". However, to
  conduct mundane matters he shrinks and masks the coat with Life,
  Forces, and Prime. Though he sometimes likes to show himself in
  other forms, his symbol of the golden feather is universal.

    The feathers are golden in color and are about 5 inches in
  length. They are straighter and more pointed than most feathers.
  They are a potent blend of drugs and magic that gives users a
  shared hallucination. They have become very popular among Cult of
  Ecstasy Mages and others now, there are even some plans to start
  selling them to Sleepers to help them see how their thoughts can
  effect reality (even if it is only a local one... or is it?)
   </p>
   <p>
    To use, the feathers are tickled at the back of the throat.
  When this happens the feathers wither and crumble into a sugary
  flavored powder (This was just a finishing touch) All users now
  share a hallucination, but this hallucination overlaps with the
  mundane world. Also all users can effect the "Feather" world by
  using their imagination.

   <h2>
    Storyteller Information:
   </h2>
   The coat of feathers is not in
  fact a separate coat, but part of "Featherboy" himself. He has
  manipulated his body to produce two wings of golden feathers (no
  mean feat) and transforms it into a coat when in the Mundane
  world. He can reduce the wings to a size where he can completely
  hide them if he wishes, but doesn't usually do so.
   <p>
    Featherworld is in fact a strange place. It is an aspect of
  the Umbra that is the Dream world of an entity called "the
  Dreamer". The Dreamer may be a personification of the Wyld, may
  be a part of the Wyld itself, or may simply be a very powerful
  Marauder Oracle in quiet. "The Dreamer" and "Featherboy" are
  somehow linked, certainly "Featherboy" is naturally attracted to
  the "The Dreamer" for obvious reasons. Whatever the true nature
  of the Dreamer a group of Marauders want to awaken it. The way
  they plan to do this is by allowing as many Mages or sleepers to
  take the feathers and change the Featherworld so that the Dreamer
  will react. This is of course very dangerous, but they are
  Marauders after all.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Featherboy" is part of all this, and has become, in as much
  as Marauders can have them, the leader of this group. He designed
  and created the Feathers by slowly altering his body using life
  magic and imbuing the feathers with the properties described
  above. He has done it so well that he no longer has to sustain
  any magic to keep the wings from producing feathers, they grow
  naturally. To imbue the feathers with the Quintessence they need,
  all he needs to do is meditate at a node.
