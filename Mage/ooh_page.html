   <h2>
    The Paradigm
   </h2>
   <b>
    The Tradition
   </b>
   : Everything has once
  and for all been defined and codified into the Great Tradition by
  the ancient masters. Nothing can ever be added to this universal
  knowledge, the best a mage can hope for is to recapitulate and
  teach the ancient wisdom ever more subtly. However, much of the
  great Tradition is lost due to the ravages of time, human folly
  and incompetence. It is the duty of all hermetic mages to seek to
  restore it to its ancient glory by collecting the scattered
  fragments.
   <h2>
    Magick
   </h2>
   <b>
    Control
   </b>
   . The mage can control the whole of
  creation by applying the secrets of the Tradition. For every
  possible circumstance there is old wisdom to fall back on, safer
  and more powerful than any new magick. The whole of the universe
  is built on the secret links of control and rulership, and a
  knowledgeable mage knows how to deal with them.
   <h2>
    Spheres
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <b>
      Correspondence: Sympathy
     </b>
     . Everything in the universe
    is linked to everything else, through subtle relations. By
    following these links (using the wisdom of Tradition to guide
    himself), a mage can find connections between seemingly
    disparate things, sense events from afar and change the
    positions of objects.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Mind: Consciousness
     </b>
     . The secret of Mind is the
    secret force of Consciousness. It is a force just like the
    elements or the Light, animating the sluggish life into higher
    thought.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Prime: The Light, Prima Materia
     </b>
     . This is the
    greatest of all forces, the force the Highest used to create
    the entire universe. It is the light from the Fiat of the Great
    Architect of the Universe. To understand it is necessary for
    all works of higher magick.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Time: Destiny
     </b>
     . Everything that happens are but a
    part in the great chains of destiny. By learning how these
    links work, a diligent mage can follow their paths backwards
    and divine their future ways.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Entropy: Imbalance
     </b>
     . Not all forces of the universe
    are in perfect balance. Some forces have destructive
    consequences, while others impose randomness and chaos on the
    others.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Spirit: Other Planes
     </b>
     . The physical world is not the
    only plane of creation. Other levels of existence spread out
    both above and below it, filled with denizens and powers beyond
    the ken of mankind. These powers and the links between the
    various planes can be controlled and understood by the wisdom
    of Tradition.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Pattern Magick: Lesser Works
     </b>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <b>
        Forces: The Elements
       </b>
       . Everything is built out of
        the interactions between the four elements. The dynamic
        nature of Fire and Air is controlled by Water and Earth,
        and the high elements Fire and Water is kept in balance by
        the low elements Earth and Air. By learning how to shift
        these equilibria, a wise mage can control the forces of the
        physical world.
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        Matter: Material Magick
       </b>
       . Matter is the heavy
        conglomeration of some of the lowest forces. It binds us in
        the physical world, yet it protects us and give us the
        tools to transform the universe. It is the floor of the
        Temple of Ascension.
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        Life: Animation
       </b>
       . Living beings are matter which
        has been animated by the animating principle, the
        life-force. The Tradition contains great wisdom regarding
        this force and how it is linked to other forces and can be
        controlled.
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h2>
    Arete
   </h2>
   <b>
    The Great Work
   </b>
   . Each mage must pursue the
  Great Work for himself, supported by his peers and helped by his
  Masters. As he pursues his goals, he will learn more and more of
  the Tradition which will show him the true nature and ways of the
  universe. This will not only give him control over it, it will
  also give him control over himself.
   <h2>
    Quintessence
   </h2>
   <b>
    Bounded Light
   </b>
   can manifest in many
  ways. It can be imprisoned in matter, flow in the cosmic forces,
  charge certain objects or just exist. Originally it came from the
  Highest, and will one day return to infinity, but currently it is
  bounded by the lower planes.
   <h2>
    Paradox
   </h2>
   <b>
    Unbalanced forces
   </b>
   . If a mage breaks
  against the Tradition or fails to properly balance the forces of
  the universe, an imbalance will result. This will inevitably
  gravitate to him, and in due time destroy him unless he can
  restore the cosmic balance.
   <h2>
    Awakening
   </h2>
   <b>
    Knowledge and Conversation with the Holy
  Guardian Angel
   </b>
   Each human being has his own Holy Guardian
  Angel (HGA), his higher self, guiding him through existence
  towards Ascension. A mage is a person who has not only met his
  HGA, but experienced the reality of the higher worlds it
  represents and choosen to follow it.
   <h2>
    Mage-specific Backgrounds
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <b>
      Arcane: Invisibility
     </b>
     . To protect themselves from
    enemies and dangers many mages learn the art of secrecy and
    hiding.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Avatar: Holy Guardian Angel
     </b>
     . Some mages are blessed
    with a HGA taking greater interest in their lives and magick,
    giving them strength in danger and succor in failure.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Destiny: Destiny
     </b>
     . Some mages are destined by the
    forces of the universe for certain acts, to preserve the great
    equilibrium. These individuals have the momentum of the entire
    universe behind them.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Dream: Understanding
     </b>
     . A few fortunate mages
    understand the Great Tradition intuitively, seeing the secret
    laws underlying everything. They are able to understand
    anything and handle anything using the precepts of the
    Tradition to support them.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Node: Fulcrum
     </b>
     . The forces of the world are in
    constant flux, yet carefully balanced against each other. In
    some places this balance can be manipulated with less exertion
    than elsewhere.
    </li>
