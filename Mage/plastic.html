   The Living Plastic Creations of Dr. Rhenborg
  </h1>

  <p>
   One of the most bizarre uses of Matter developed so far is the
  living plastic invented by Dr. Rhenborg. He has combined the
  normal properties of plastic with properties of living beings
  such as movement, healing and instincts, for use as servants and
  weapons.
  </p>
  <p>
   The plastic creations are brightly coloured, elastic beings
  able to stretch immensely before breaking. They are resistant to
  acids, but become stiff in cold environments and tend to melt
  when confronted with fire. They are completely mindless, only
  able to perform the duties stamped into their molecular structure
  by Dr. Rhenborg when the plastic is polymerised.
  </p>
  <p>
   Usually he keeps them in the form of plain blocks of plastic,
  which are then activated by heating them somewhat or ripping away
  a protective cover. The earliest designs were patterned after
  dinosaurs and other plastic toys (the doctor had originally
  planned them as presents for his grandchildren), but today they
  instead become amorphous beings with hundred of small legs,
  claws, flapping slits and antennae (possibly a sign of the
  increasing Quiet of the doctor).
  </p>
  <p>
   One typical applications is the carrying creation, a big blue
  glob able to move heavy objects as indicated by the doctor.
  Another is the gripper plastic, a small block of red plastic
  which when thrown onto someone starts gripping it with plastic
  tentacles. A third kind is the black and white destroyer ball. By
  combining big blocks of plastics and heating them, they form a
  huge chequered ball that will aggressively attack anything
  perceived as a threat; it will bash down walls, roll over cars or
  crush people. Unfortunately it is also a bit unpredictable
  weapon. Other experiments have been the green guard spider, the
  purple tyrannosaur-dog and the yellow dance-on-paper-pyramid.
