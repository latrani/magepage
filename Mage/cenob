I've only been reading this newsgroup for a few weeks now, but
it seems that half the fun is creating new bloodlines. Well,
a while ago I wrote some rules for introducing Cenobites into
the game. They're not a new bloodline, clan, tradition etc
so I don't know if it's appropriate, but here goes anyway.

                   LEVIATHAN AND THE CENOBITES
                   ---------------------------

HISTORY
-------

During the time of the Second City, the power of the Weaver was low
compared to that of the Wyld and the Wyrm. The Wyld had vast tracts
of what was to become America to itself and the Wyrm's agents, the
vampires, were steadily growing in power. The only humans who sought
any kind of order that appealed to the Weaver were under the influence
of the Kindred.

In order to attempt to counter this inbalance in power at the time,
the Weaver attempted many strategies; one of these was Leviathan. It
was created as a spiritual entity which could create minor realms
under it's control and extend it's influence from there to help it's
servants on Earth. It's purpose was to help the humans break free of
the vampires. It failed.

Shortly after it's creation, it was attacked by the forces of the Wyrm
and then the Wyld. It was believed to have been destroyed and the
Weaver eventually broke the power of the Second City by creating
internal discord among the kindred.

Leviathan did, in fact, survive the attacks, but only just. It took
many centuries to reform itself and many more to gain any sought of
power. However, it had been permantley tainted by the Wyrm and Wyld,
and it's goals had altered significantly. It now believed that the
major source of chaos in the world was the flesh, and those pleasures
associated with it. It believed that humans should be able to ascend
to a higher state, where they could bring order to their flesh, and
replace pleasure with pain, a more clinical and ordered sensation.

During it's years of rebuilding, Leviathan developed a method of
allowing it's followers to achieve the required state of being. This
method involved carving a pattern into the flesh and/or soul of the
being so that Leviathan could empower them. This pattern was different
everytime and was named a Lament Configuration.

During the time of the Roman Empire, Leviathan re-emerged from it's
slumber. It had created several realms (Malkuths) from which it could
extend it's influence and a group of beings to help it called the
Cenobites. It utilized a series of keys (Kethers) to allow the
Cenobites to summon more humans. These either become servants on Earth
or 'worshippers', turned into Pillars of Nephesch or consigned to
their own personal Hells.

Leviathan quietly grew in strength due to the power absorbed from his
'worshippers' and slowly extended it's influence. However, it quickly
realized that all the other powers had taken over the Earth and,
afraid that it would suffer the same fate as before, decided that it
should try to limit it's expansion so that it could remain relatively
unnoticed by everything else. This has remained the same up until the
current time.

SERVANTS OF LEVIATHAN
---------------------

GENERAL

All the servants of Leviathan have several things in common. The
creation process involves the empowering of the being using the Lament
Configuration. The carving of the Configuration is a terrible process
which strips the being of any previous morals and imposes Leviathans
own's rules and beliefs on their mentality.

All the servants have their own set of rules. Leviathan was created by
the Weaver and hence is bound by a sense of order. The influence of
the Wyld has meant that his manifests as a series of rules laid down
to it's servants. The amount of laws given to the highest ranks of
cenobites, the Magister and Geburah, are so conflicting and numerous
that it needs a warped intellect to be able to survive day to day
without breaking Hells rules.

CENOBITES: MAGISTER

These are the cenobites who are in charge of each individual Malkuth.
They answer only to the shard of Leviathan that inhabits their realm.
They have control of who becomes cenobites and servants in their
particular Malkuth and the shape that the Malkuth takes. An example is
Pinhead, who was answerable only to the Diamond shaped shard of
Leviathan who inhabits his particular Malkuth. He has shaped the
Malkuth to appear as a Gothic, stone labyrinth, and he would have
chosen the other cenobites. Even the form the Kether used would have
been his choice, though he uses the same one as summoned him.

CENOBITES: GEBURAH

These cenobites are created by Leviathan and are nothing to do with
the Magister's. They are not confined to one Malkuth and are normally
created to either enforce the rules or to fight on Leviathan's behalf
in the Deep Umbra. From the film's, the example was the Doctor from
the second film, who was specifically created to punish Pinhead for
breaking the rules of Hell.

CENOBITES: CHEZA

These are the cenobites created by the Magister to aid him in running
the Malkuth. From the films, these are the other three who make up the
quartet that Kirsty encounters.

QLIPOTH

These are constructs, created from destroyed souls and flesh, who act
as guardians on the Malkuth. They can take any shape or form and
respond solely to the Magister.

BERASHITH

They are the servants of the Magister, who guard the Kethers on Earth
and 'aid' would be worshippers of Leviathan to achieve glory. The
bearded man whon follows Kirsty and rescues the Kether from the fire
at the end of the first film is an example.

PHRIXUS

They are miscellaneous followers of Leviathan who live on Earth. They
obey one Magister and help Leviathan to fight it's subtle battles on
Earth, destroying the Wyrm and Wyld and fighting to help Leviathan's
views become more prevalent. Their work has recently included the move
to make 'S&M' more acceptable, and the Middle East is another favorite
hunting ground of theirs.

MALKUTHS AND KETHERS
--------------------

Malkuths are the personal realms of Leviathan. They are found in the
Deep Umbra. Each Malkuth has a splinter of Leviathan contained within
and is ruled by a Cenobite Magister with several Cenobite Cheza as
assisstants and many Qlipoth as guards.

Malkuths are powered by the suffering of those inside. It will house
many Pillars of Nephesch (see later) which fuels Leviathan. There will
also be a number of personal hells. Those which have annoyed the
Magister will have a part of the Malkuth dedicated to making their
existence as sweet as possible for the attendant Cenobites.

Every Malkuth appears very different. They are formed by the ruling
Magister in whatever image she wishes and she can change it at any
time. They all, though, have a highly oppressive atmosphere, giving an
impression of suffering to all those that visit it. However, due to
the type of being chosen to be a Magister, they also tend to be
arranged in a logical manner.

At the centre is Leviathan. The particular appearance of Leviathan
will normally bear a resemblance to the style of Kether employed by
the ruling Magister. To make sure that all the attendant Cenobites are
fulfilling their duties, Leviathan absorbs all their memories whenever
they are near its presence. It returns those which it approves of the
most to act as guidance for the future. Although this is extremely
distressing for any visitors, Cenobites actually enjoy the procedure
because they get to relive their greatest triumphs purified of any
extraneous background.

The Malkuth not only powers Leviathan, but also the very realm. The
power is represented by two factors. Firstly, all Ruachs within the
Malkuth will have a reduced power cost, from -1 to -10 depending on
the power of the Malkuth. Also, half the power cost reduction is also
a bonus modifier to the skill roll for the Ruach. It is very dangerous
to take on the Cenobites on their own turf.

The only standard way in to these realms is either by locating it
within the Deep Umbra, or by activating a Kether. Kethers are held by
the Berashith who serve the particular Magister. Each Kether can take
on any form, though they usually stay in one particular fashion for
some time. They can only be solved by a desire to open them. They take
the form of a puzzle designed to bring out the attribute less used out
of the two Leviathan desires, Pain and Order. For those seeking new
sensations, in could be a complex mental puzzle such as a puzzle box;
for a crossword buff it could be a simple puzzle with clues designed
to make him commit acts of suffering eg 1 down: the taste of flesh.
No matter the design, it is only when the desire is strong enough that
the Kether opens.

It may take a long time to open a Kether, but once open there is a
path from the being to the Malkuth until the puzzle is unsolved. While
this path is open, any Cenobite may open a gate from the Malkuth to
enjoy the being. It is possible that more than one person is in the 
area while the gate is open. Leviathan has many complex and
conflicting rules about which of these may be taken as well. Many a
hunter has believed she knew how to get around the Cenobites only to
find she was mistaken, and paid the ultimate price, fueling Leviathan.

There is only one way to escape from a Malkuth. A physical
representation of suffering must make contact with something of value
to the captured being, which is usually the place where she made the
leap to the Malkuth. The most strong willed have been known to send
visions to those close to them in order for this to happen, but that
is only if they are in a hell rather than consigned to a Pillar.

Even once escaped, there are problems. There is always a taint on the
being due to her capture and torture, though this changes with the
escape so it is more difficult to track down. Also, if they have been
consigned to a Pillar, then there is no body for them to escape in,
and one must be created by repeating what happened to allow the
initial escape.

RUACH
-----

These are the powers of the followers of Leviathan. They are all
powered by the Lament Configuration carved into them all. Each power
has a associated skill which must be bought separetely and a power
cost which is paid for by the suffering currently contained within the
Shivadarshana.

There are five patterns that form the Ruach gained from a Lament
Configuration, and five powers contained within each pattern except
for Magisters and Geburah, who have the Core Pattern at a higher level
and can use the higher Ruach's.

All the Ruach's should be personalised for the specific follower. The
Cenobites have a great presence and style about them, and their powers
should refect this. To take Pinhead as an example everyone should be
famaliar with;his Rending the Flesh is the fish hooks on chains; his
flesh has been sculpted in the classic gridded head; he insists that
all his Cenobites adopt a blue skin; whenever an equivalent of Leaving
the Realm is done in the films, you see the lights penetrating the
slats in the walls. These all add to the personality of Pinhead, and
any Followers created should have an equally personal style.

SHIVADARSHANA

This is the capacity of the Followers Lament Configuration to contain
pain and suffering. It can be refueled by Leviathan itself in a
Malkuth or using a Ruach to fuel it.

MODIFIERS TO RUACH SKILL

Aura of Local Area           -2 to +2
Distraction                  +1
Extra Time                   -1 to -2

CORE PATTERN

Level 1: Empower Configuration         
Cost : N/A                   Dur. :N/A

This allows the power to be gained. The follower absorbs the suffering
from those around him, for example 'helping out' at a car wreck. A
skill roll is made every hour, at a difficulty given by the
Storyteller depending on the extent of suffering surrounding the
Follower at the time. Every success refuels the Shivadarshana by one a
point of power.

Level 2: Overcome Flaws in the Flesh
Cost : 3                     Dur. :Table 2

This removes the wound penalties from the Follower (See later). The
penalties are only there due to the flesh being unable to perform its
functions. This places a configuration over the flesh so that if the
flesh is weak, the configuration will perform instead. This will
appear very strange for some wounds, even filling in a portion of arm
to connect a hand to the rest of the body.

Level 3: Enhance Configuration
Cost : 5                     Dur. :Table 1

Every thing that is the Follower is contained within the Configuration
carved into her. This Ruach lets power flow into the configuration to 
boost the attributes of the Follower. The skill roll is dif. 6, every
succ. providing a +1 to an attribute of the Follower's choice.

Level 4: Absorb Suffering
Cost : N/A                   Dur. :N/A

The Follower can now refuel her Shivadarshana directly by torturing a
being, and absorbing it's suffering directly. The skill roll is 8 for
no permanent harm to the being, 6 for a permanent derangement, and 4
for death to the being; this can be modified for extra time spent, or
if the Follower has to hurry. Every succ. refuels three points.

Level 5: Empower Area
Cost : Var.                  Dur. :Table 1

Power can be given to an area to give it the property of a Malkuth in
reducing the cost of Ruach by giving it an aura of suffering. For
every 5  spent, the area has 10m radius and a reduction in cost of 1.
For every 10 spent, the area also has a -1 modifier to all Ruach skill
rolls. The skill roll is dif. 6 to enable the suffering to stay in the
area rather than dispursing.

MIND PATTERN

Level 1: Assess Worshipper
Cost : N/A                   Dur. :Table 2


This Ruach allows the Follower to scan the mind and body of a being.
It can allow study of an aura, emotional patterns and anything
unusual about the body. It finds awakened beings, spells on bodies,
taints of Wyrm, Weaver or Wyld and most other effects. It's main use
is for assessing potential 'worshippers', to see if they are fit for
the task, though also very useful for general spying. The detail of
infomation is dependent on the number of succ., and the difficulty is
6 normally, though the Storyteller may modify it. It takes the form of
an enhancement of the Followers vision.

Level 2: Persuasion
Cost : 1-3                   Dur. :Var.

The Follower can now start to effect other minds. She can implant
suggestions, or charm someone. The duration and strength of the
effect are variable. The Follower states the effect she is trying
for, then the Storyteller assigns a difficulty for the skill roll; 3
succ. are required for the effect given. For example, a minor charm
on a doorkeeper in order to gain admittance is dif. 4, whereas the
sama effect on a bankmanager would need to last a scene, so is dif.6.
This is resisted by willpower dif. 8.

Level 3: Free One's Own Mind
Cost : 3                     Dur. :Table 2

The Follower can now effect her own mind to such an extent that she
concentrate on multiple items at the same time. Every succ. on a skill
roll dif. 6 grant's the Follower an extra item of thought. This can
allow multiple Ruach's to be utilised in the same round, though every
action is simultaneous, and so they cannot be dependent on each other.

Level 4: Invasion of the Mind
Cost : 5                     Dur. :1 Scene

The Follower is able to invade another beings thoughts. The dif. is 6
for the skill roll, resisted by the opponents willpower dif. 8. The
number of succ. scored over the opponent determines the depth of
invasion from surface thoughts (1 succ.) to complete knowledge of the
opponents entire memory,(5 succ.) and even knowledge of the
subconsciosness and past lives (10 succ.).

Level 5: Worshipper's Dreams
Cost : 5-10                  Dur. :Table 1

The Follower can alter people's thoughts. This can vary from placing
illusions in peoples perceptions, altering their dreams, destroying
their memories and even altering their natures. The difficulty is
completely up to the discretion of the Storyteller, and is resisted
by the person's willpower dif. 8.

PATTERN OF THE FLESH

Level 1: Flesh Sculpture
Cost : N/A                   Dur. :Perm

The Follower can begin to sculpt her own flesh into something more
satisfying for her. This can include slight tatoos on the shoulders
or removing a scar on the hip, upto replacing the eye with a video
camera, or severing the vocal cords with barbed wire. This only ever
has a cosmetic effect in game terms, so that the voice is no different
and the Follower could not see in infra-red with the camera. The skill
roll is at a dificulty set by the Storyteller, though good, original
ideas should be rewarded by lower dificulties. A few succ. will mean
that something is slightly wrong with the sculpture, whereas a failure
means the attempt was aborted and a botch is left to the Storyteller.

Level 2: Reformation of the Flesh
Cost : 1                     Dur. :N/A

This allows the Follower to reform any wounds that she has taken. The
skill roll is dif.6 for normal, dif.8 for aggravated. Multiple
attempts may be made to heal the same wound, though each succesive one
is at a +1. Each success heals 1 wound level .Botches cause the
aggravated damage equal to the no. of ones.

Level 3: Transformation of the Flesh
Cost : 5                     Dur. :Succ. Days

The Follower can create another image which she can change into,
swapping between forms as long as the Ruach lasts. The skill roll is
dif. 6 for a standard form, dif.7-9 for unusual forms (werewolf, bird)
and dif. 10 for a copying someone else's image, though rough
approximation are easier. The difficulty of all Ruach's while in the
altered form is increased by 2 due to a warped Lament Configuration.

Level 4: Ignorance of the Flesh
Cost : N/A                   Dur. :N/A

The Follower can warp her configuration so quickly that it can ignore
damage eg. when Pinhead spits out the bullets in Hell on Earth. The
skill roll is dif.6 for normal and dif. 8 for aggravated or mental,
each success preventing one point of damage.

Level 5: Creation of the Flesh.
Cost : 30/10                 Dur. :Perm/Succ. Days

The Follower can slowly warp flesh so that she can create a Qlipoth.
The rules are left completely up to the player and Storyteller
involved, although rules are given later for standard Qlipoth. The
Follower can also perform the above Transformation of the Flesh on
another being now.

REMOTE PATTERN

Level 1: Weaver Taint
Cost : 10                    Dur. :Perm

The Follower can taint a being or object with a Weaver taint. The
taint is subtlety different from standard so other followers will
recognize individual taints. All Kethers are tainted, as are potential
'worshippers'.

Level 2: Enhance the Sensation
Cost : 3                     Dur. :Table 2

The Follower can allow herself and others to experience the joy of
pain better. The skill roll is dif. 4-8 depending on range (touch:
close range:LOS:nearby:within a few miles) and resisted by willpower
dif.8 if the subject is unwilling. For each succ. scored over the
opponent, she has one extra wound penalty.

Level 3: Scarring the Flesh
Cost : N/A                   Dur. :N/A

The Follower has the ability to damage opponents at range. The skill
roll is dif equal to Enhance the Sensation, each success causing one
wound level of damage which can be soaked.

Level 4: Corrupting the Flesh
Cost : 3/10/5                Dur. :Instant Table 2/Other Table 1/N/A

The Follower has the ability to alter the flesh of an opponent
according to Leviathan's designs. In an instant, the Follower can
corrupt the flesh of an opponent. On a skill roll dif as Scarring the
Flesh, resisted by Stamina dif. 6, each succ. lowers one Physical 
attribute of opponent by one, chosen by Follower. If given time, the
Follower can mould the Flesh as per Flesh Sculpture except on the
opponent. The Follower can also perform a specific Flesh Scupture to
create a Reformation of Flesh on someone else

Level 5: Rending the Flesh
Cost : 5                     Dur. :N/A

This is a higher level equivalent of Scarring the Flesh. It works the
same except damage is either aggravated or times 3.

PATTERN OF THE REALMS

Level 1: Visualising the Realm
Cost : 1                     Dur. :Table 2

The Follower can see remote places or items in the world she is
currently occupying. The number of succ. gives the amount of detail
seen. The dif. for seeing beings is 6, modified by arcane and
obfuscate, for items set by the Storyteller and for places dependent
on the distance 4-10(as per Scarring the Flesh:within 100 miles:this
realm). A modifier of bonus of 1 to 3 can be applied for familiarity
with that being visualised. To see a taint known to the Follower, it
dif 5.

Level 2: Transversing the Realm
Cost : 3                     Dur. :Table 1

The Follower has gained the ability to travel across the world. A
skill roll is made dif 4-8 depending on the familiarity of the place
the caster is travelling to or 5 for a specific place in relation to
a known taint. This opens up a passage to the location. Only Phrixus,
Berashith and Cenobite Geburah amy use this Ruach.

Level 3: Controlling the Realm
Cost : 3                     Dur. :Table 2

Now the Follower can control the part of the Realm near her. This
includes creating illusions, moving objects, closing and locking doors
etc. For moving objects Str is taken to be Int, and Wits is Dex. All
other effects should be based on appropriate Attributes and Abilities.
The skill roll is dif. 6 for around her, dif 8 for an area she is
visualising, succ. times 10m is the radius of area that can be
affected.

Level 4: Leaving the Realm
Cost : 5-10                  Dur. :Table 1

This works the same as Transversing the Realm except this opens
bridges between worlds. It only opens bridges between adjacent worlds
eg Earth and Near Umbra, Near Umbra and Horizon Realm or Deep Umbra.
The Malkuth of her Magister is always considered adjacent. Only
Phrixus, Berashith and Cenobite Geburah may use this Ruach.

Level 5: Summoning Leviathan
Cost : 10                    Dur. :Table 2

This is a very powerful effect which co-locates the an area 10mx10m
around the Follower with the Malkuth of the Follower's Magister.
Within this area, all benefits of being within the Malkuth apply, and
the inhabitants of the Malkuth may use this gate to explore and help
the Follower though they are dragged back as soon as the effect ends.
Only Phrixus, Berashith and Cenobite Geburah may use this Ruach.

CORE PATTERN : MAGISTERS ONLY

Level 6: Pillars of Nephesch
Cost : 10                    Dur. :Perm

This enables the Magister to capture the destroyed soul of a
worshipper inside a prison, usually a pillar adorned with personal
items of the worshipper such as the flesh of his face. It is these,
along with the suffering of the special few in their personal hells,
that fuels the Malkuths, and in turn Leviathan itself.

Level 7: Creating the Lament
Cost : 50                    Dur. :Perm

This marks the time when a Magister gains final control over the
Malkuth. This Ruach enables the Magister to carve the Lament
Configuration herself, instead of Leviathan performing the task. It is
an extremely dificult task, and only the most trusted Magisters are
allowed to use this Ruach.

CORE PATTERN : GEBURAH ONLY

Level 6: Imprisonment
Cost : 25                    Dur. :Perm

This creates a minature Malkuth in which a being is imprisonned. The
suffering of the being itself is what fuels the Malkuth. These have
some form of outward physical presence and can only be escaped in the
same way as escaping a Malkuth. They have a Kether attached to the
outside which sends the being to an appropriate Malkuth in case she
escapes.

Level 7: Unravelling the Lament
Cost : 50                    Dur. :Perm

This is the ultimate gift to a Geburah. They not only fight Leviathans
battles, but also enforce it's rules. This Ruach has the capability of
destroying the Lament Configuration carved into a being, or removing.
If destruction is the attempt, the skill roll at dif. 6 is resisted by
willpower dif. 8 as an extended roll. If the Geburah attains 10 succ.
without botching or failing, the Configuration is destroyed and the
being returns to what it originally was. If the Configuration is
removed, only 5 succ. are required. The being and his Cenobite form
are separated, resulting in the most pure Cenobites known. The being
is normally killed, though they have been known to return as wraiths.

CHARACTER CREATION
------------------

This is designed for Cenobites to be created as very powerful NPC's in
the world. it is envisioned that the only ones that might possibly be
played by the players are Phrixus and Berashith. It is suggested that
Cenobites are only allowed into the game after a great deal of thought
and discussion.

If it is listed that the character has immunity, this is due to
Leviathan intervening and gifting the character type this ability.
Almost nothing can damage the character. The two exceptions are Weaver
creations and Supernatural effects. Anything which is considered by
the Weaver a supernatural effect will be allowed to effect the
character, though it will not do aggravated damage. The interpretation
of this is left up to the Storyteller, as the characters may well not 
be aware what can effect them. It is suggested that only vulgar magick
can hurt them, as Leviathan would not be aware that it is supernatural
and that a werewolf's punch would not hurt them, but a rake with her
claws would.

The other exception is that nothing purely of the Weaver is protected
against, though the character could still soak. The Weaver placed this
ruling in Leviathan when constructed, and it has not been over-ruled
yet. This does not include those with the Weaver taint, but those that
escaped from the Pillars of Nephesch have completely reconstructed
their bodies and so are completely Weaver constructs. There is a tale
of an escapee who re-entered Hell armed with a pistol containing
bullets made out of his own little finger bones, as these could hurt
the Cenobites.

The other immunity granted is that nothing can effect the mind except
to hurt it. Leviathan does not want his Followers dissuaded from their
tasks.

The Followers of Leviathan are unnatural creatures. They do not
require food or drink, though they can partake. Their bodies need no
external sustenance at all, including oxygen. Their bodies do not
function as human beings, though they do take damage from extreme
pressure, heat and cold. As there are no chemical reactions normally
happening in a Followers body, they appear slightly cool to the touch.

The Phrixus and Berashith live on Earth. They remember their former
lives and continue to live some form of lie on Earth while serving
their Magister, though the goals set each individual follower vary
widely. They are told whatever is necessary by their Magister, who
can open a mind link with them at anytime.

If they take enough damage to be taking below the -5 wound penalty,
they become their manisfestation form, eg at the end of the first film
the Berashith who guarded Kirsty's Kether retrieved it from the fire
and become a skeletal winged demon. This form is under the direct
control of Leviathan. It has immunity, and may not attack anything. It
should fulfill as much of it's task as possible and return to the 
Malkuth. It has the ability to cross realm boudaries and go straight
to the Malkuth. Only a Magister can resemble the original form once a
Follower has reverted to manisfestation form, and unless they can
return using their own powers, they must wait for a gate to be created
either by a Kether, or by someone summoning the Malkuth.

If the Follower is still in the original form and takes enough damage
that this would wrap around and destry the manisfestation form as
well, then they never become the manifestation form, and are utterly
destroyed.

A Qlipoth is a created quard. They are enslaved to their creator and
have no function in life except to serve. They do not have immunity.
They can have any form, limited only to the imagination of the creator
which, since this is a Cenobite, normally results in warped creations
at best.

Cenobite Cheza are created by the Cenobite Magister to aid in running
the Malkuth. They have immunity, and can contact the Magister via a
mental link whenever they wish. They have their memories wiped of
everything when they become Cenobites, though some have been known to
remember their previous life. It is very rare for a Cenobite Cheza to
leave the Malkuth except through the Kether gates to welcome a new
worshipper.

Cenobite Magister are extremely powerful servants of Leviathan. They
are specifically created to rule a particular Malkuth. When created,
they lose all previous memories, and are told a new version of life as
specified by Leviathan. It is their role to also create Cenobite Cheza
and Qlipoth, and to instruct these in their new life. Cenobite
Magister are granted immunity by Leviathan, and can contact all their
servants mentally. They can also converse with their splinter of
Leviathan.

These Cenobites are created by Leviathan. It will interfere in the
running of a Malkuth temporarily in order to create a Geburah. No
Magister has any say in who becomes a Geburah. No particular Malkuth
is the home of a Geburah, though they often inhabit particular realms
temporarily. These are the soldiers and enforcers of Leviathan. They
are granted immunity and may mentally converse with the whole of
Leviathan as they require. They answer to no-one except Leviathan.

FOOTNOTE
--------

These rules have been created to allow the Cenobites of the HellRaiser
fame to enter the World of Darkness. I have long been a fan of Clive
Barkers creations, and believe they fit in with the theme and mood of
White Wolf's world.

If anyone has any comments and suggestions on how to improve this
system, or even simply how the Cenobites worked in their game, please
let me know. My email is djwilson@tcp.co.uk
