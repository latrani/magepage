Even more great hits like the Void Engineers' rendition of the Police:
Walking on the Moon!

	Giant steps are what you take,
		Working on the moon,
	I hope my funding's safe,
		Working on the moon,
	We could work forever,
		Working on the moon,
	High Tech is our lever,
		Working on, working on the moon.

	Working in deep Umbra,
		Working on the moon,
	Sights we see would numb ya,
		Working on the moon,
	Silver cord, just barely seen,
		Working on the moon,
	Silver cord's a spaceship clean,
		Working on, working on the moon,

	Some, they say,
	I'm wasting my time away,
	No way,
	And if it's the price I pay,
	Some say,
	Tomorrow's another day,
	To play,
	A curse on those Fey!

	Giant steps are what you take,
		Working on the moon,
	I hope my funding's safe,
		Working on the moon,
	We could walk forever,
		Working on the moon,
	High Tech is our lever,
		Working on, working on the moon.

	Keep it up, ...

...Next!
