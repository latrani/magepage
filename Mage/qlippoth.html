   <h2>
    Qlippothic Spheres
   </h2>
   Qlippothic magick deals with the dark
  sides of the spheres, or rather the forces normal mages do their
  best to avoid. They are notoriously vulgar and dangerous, but at
  the same time quite powerful. A Qlippothic mage can use all
  normal spheric magick (although with a definite qlippothic slant)
  but also other effects, normally not possible in more balanced
  paradigms. The Nephandi are the most well known Qlippothic mages,
  but there are other mages who have been drawn to the unbalanced
  by madness, lust for power or curiosity. However, once you start
  to use qlippothic magick, it becomes hard to stop.
   <h3>
    Correspondence
   </h3>
   Unlike in the traditional paradigm,
  Nephandi does not see everything as a part of an indivisible
  unity. Everything can be taken apart, even the Correspondence
  Point. This makes qlippothic Correspondence dangerous, both for
  its users and its victims.
   <ol>
    <li>
     Detect Warping. The Mage can notice errors and illusions of
    space or perspective. These weak points of space exist
    everywhere, and connect all places through secret links beneath
    reality.
    </li>
    <li>
     Watch through the cracks of reality. The mage can look
    through the weak points of space into other places.
    </li>
    <li>
     Move through the cracks. The mage has the power to slip
    through the weak points and emerge elsewhere. However, he has
    to be very careful to hold himself together, so that the
    different parts of him would not break apart. He can also send
    out his mind through the cracks, to find something anywhere in
    the world... or beneath.
    </li>
    <li>
     At higher levels the mage can move other objects through
    space, as a whole or take them apart. He can also create new
    cracks, and patch them together (this creates creases and
    strange overlaps in space).
    </li>
    <li>
     The Mage is now able to take apart and rearrange space
    itself, even changing the number of dimensions. Such
    rearrangements tend to be rather unstable and very destructive
    for anything caught in them.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <h3>
    Entropy
   </h3>
   This is dealt with in the
   <em>
    Book of
  Madness
   </em>
   .
   <h3>
    Forces
   </h3>
   Qlippothic magic does not deal with the balanced
  flows of energy the Traditions and Technocracy uses. Instead it
  creates and controls unbalanced, destructive forces or the lack
  of energy. The forces a qlippothic mage wield are usually violent
  or somehow corrupting (electricity is filled with spikes, gravity
  tugs in different ways at once).
   <ol>
    <li>
     Detect potentials. The mage can detect potentials where
    energies attract or repel each other. At such points the
    slightest change could break the equilibrium and cause
    disruption.
    </li>
    <li>
     Disrupt lesser forces. Normally ordered forces such as
    light or electricity can be disrupted, loosing their usability
    and becoming irritating or destructive. Electronic devices
    break down or are destroyed, light becomes gritty and strangely
    unable to help perceptions.
    </li>
    <li>
     Destroy lesser forces. The mage can not only create forces,
    he can also destroy them. Light can be turned into darkness,
    electricity drained and sound dampened.
    </li>
    <li>
     Disrupt greater forces. Now the mage can make any force
    begin to counteract itself. Tidal forces can rip apart objects,
    heat concentrate itself and moving vehicles start to tumble
    chaotically.
    </li>
    <li>
     Destroy greater forces. The mage can now remove gravity or
    drain heat. In principle he can remove all forces from
    something, making it dissolve into dead matter.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <h3>
    Life
   </h3>
   Unlike normal life, qlippothic life cannot sustain
  itself. It needs something to feed on, be it the quintessence
  flow the mage invokes or other kinds of life. Any life affected
  by qlippothic magick becomes slightly parasitic; the cells feed
  of their neighbors, plants suck out all the nourishment in the
  soil and animals are filled with a raging hunger to sate the
  unlife within them. Without a constant supply of external energy
  it will die (although qlippothic life has a nasty tendency to
  take a long time to die completely).
   <ol>
    <li>
     Detect disease. The mage is able to find all weak points,
    potential diseases and wounds within another living being.
    </li>
    <li>
     The mage can warp simple life, like blighting plants or
    forcing insects to grow. Warped life is always slightly sickly
    and deformed.
    </li>
    <li>
     Warp complex life. The mage can change himself (this will
    of course bind him stronger to the qlippoth, since he will need
    the energies of the sphere even more in the future). He can
    also create simple pseudo-living beings, not able to survive on
    their own but usually quite tenacious.
    </li>
    <li>
     The mage can warp all forms of life, including other
    people.
    </li>
    <li>
     Transmute flesh. The mage can turn living beings into true
    unlife, like humans into vampires. This unlife is quite potent
    (as long as it can feed on the quintessence of other life) and
    strongly tied to the qlippoth of life.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <h3>
    Matter
   </h3>
   Qlippothic matter is the sphere of ruining objects
  and removing the properties of matter.
   <ol>
    <li>
     Detect flaws and impurities.
    </li>
    <li>
     Create qlippothic matter. Qlippothic matter is notoriously
    inert and useless; it is not affected by most forces, cannot
    sustain life or be used for anything. It is also very hard to
    destroy or get rid of, and just accumulates as dirt or
    garbage.
    </li>
    <li>
     Remove properties of matter. The mage can remove properties
    such as cohesion, color, strength or nourishment.
    </li>
    <li>
     Transmute matter into qlippothic matter.
    </li>
    <li>
     Create pure qlippothic matter. Pure qlippothic matter is
    very hard to affect by any form of magick, and almost
    indestructible. It just ties up Quintessence so that it cannot
    be used.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <h3>
    Mind
   </h3>
   Qlippothic Mind deals with disorientation, imbalance
  and insanity.
   <ol>
    <li>
     Warped Mind. One of the first things a student of the
    sphere learns is to gain insight from madness, how to twist his
    own thoughts around and gather power from the dark recesses of
    the mind. They become able to jumps of insight and vision, at
    the mere price of their sanity.
    </li>
    <li>
     Emotional insecurity. The mage can affect the emotions and
    drives of another person, turning them against him or against
    each other. Love can turn into obsession, self confidence can
    break down into doubts and hidden fears brought to life.
    Neuroses can be created.
    </li>
    <li>
     Disorientation. Consciousness and thought are quite
    unstable entities, and can easily be broken. He can derail
    trains of thought, induce hallucinations, force a victim into a
    coma or psychosis.
    </li>
    <li>
     Break the Mind. The mind of a victim can be permanently
    warped into unrecognizable patterns.
    </li>
    <li>
     Shatter the Mind. At this level, the mage not only can
    break away minds from their bodies, but also parts of the
    minds. Memory, cognition or thought can be removed or sent away
    to other places. Things from the Astral plane can be brought
    into reality.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <h3>
    Prime
   </h3>
   Qlippothic Prime magick is among the most unholy
  arts of magick in existence. It corrupts and transmutes Prime
  into non-existence, removing it from reality or curdling it into
  an useless entropic state. Quintessence fed into patterns will
  have a qlippothic resonance, which will affect them in subtle
  ways. They will become more unstable, less efficient and often
  spread their corruption further.
   <ol>
    <li>
     Detect paradox. The mage can detect paradox and other
    strains in reality, weak points where it can unravel
    further.
    </li>
    <li>
     Drain Quintessence. The mage can leak out Quintessence from
    a magickal pattern, weakening it. Normal patterns are usually
    too strong to affect, but they can be slightly
    destabilized.
    </li>
    <li>
     Dark Talismans. Talismans created by qlippothic magick are
    both dangerous and nasty. Their effects are strongly
    qlippothic, and they also tend to attract paradox. However,
    their nature also makes them very good at destroying,
    corrupting and warping things in unpleasant ways, even if they
    were not intended for it.
    </li>
    <li>
     Drain. By draining away the quintessence of a pattern it
    can be undone, and its existence is converted into qlippothic
    quintessence. It is of course possible to just undo some parts
    of a pattern, leaving the rest unstable and decaying.
    </li>
    <li>
     Destroy quintessence. This apparently removes the
    Quintessence from reality altogether, turning being into
    un-being.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <h3>
    Spirit
   </h3>
   Qlippothic spirit is quite similar to normal
  Spirit magick, although it deals with the more malevolent aspects
  of the Umbra.
   <ol>
    <li>
     Find breach. Qlippothic mages often seek out weak points in
    the gauntlet to widen them further, gradually undermining
    it.
    </li>
    <li>
     See the nether realms. Qlippothic mages are able to
    perceive the qlippothic realms beneath reality, and summon
    beings from them.
    </li>
    <li>
     Breach the gauntlet. The mage can now pass through flaws in
    the gauntlet into the uppermost nether realms, and perceive the
    Abyss below.
    </li>
    <li>
     Destroy the gauntlet. The mage can disrupt the protective
    shell of the gauntlet, opening the way for the darkness below.
    He can also bind and warp spirits, forcing them to become
    qlippothic entities themselves.
    </li>
    <li>
     Enter the Abyss. The mage is able to enter the spiritual
    abyss below reality unharmed, and to contact its denizens.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <h3>
    Time
   </h3>
   Just as space can be taken apart or cracked, the
  chains of causality can be manipulated by a qlippothic mage. It
  isn't possible to get anything useful done during qlippothic
  time, and it seems to stretch on for a grey eternity or speed up
  just when it shouldn't.
   <ol>
    <li>
     Find the angles of time. Qlippothic mages have an strange
    tendency to find the exactly wrong moments to do something; the
    results are unpredictable and often dangerous. They can find
    the wrinkles and angles of time, and use them to make chains of
    events to go wrong.
    </li>
    <li>
     Peer through the wrinkles. All the angles and flaws in the
    timestream are linked together, and qlippothic mages have a
    fantastic ability to predict bad news or discern past events
    better left buried.
    </li>
    <li>
     Dead time. The mage can make time more or less useless.
    Nothing important can happen, or it just flies away before
    anything useful gets done.
    </li>
    <li>
     Unlink time. The mage can remove things from the
    timestream, partially or as a whole. If an object is only
    partially removed, one part will age indefinitely while the
    other is preserved or vice versa. They can also be thrown into
    a timeless limbo.
    </li>
    <li>
     Destroy time. The mage is able to break the flow of time
    and causality; events do not have effects or time just passes
    without anything happening. Time can also be broken apart and
    put together, forming endless causal loops.
    </li>
   </ol>
