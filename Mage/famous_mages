I've been thinking of that one off and on for years.  The important parameter
would be 'in what culture or time-period?'  Below is a list of (Western) mages
as I've found them in my library.  Additions welcome.  This is a work in
progress and I'd appreciate if it wasn't circulated until it was finished.
Your assistance in polish/research welcomed.

Thyagi,

Nice list. Two things. This first is that I found your classification
confusing. People like Trithemius and Ramon Llul (for example)
appeared in the oddest places. The second is that some time ago 
I began compiling two lists of my own. The list enclosed is a very 
rudimentary list of Kabbalists. Compiling the list was a non-terminating 
activity - each Rabbi lead to five more. I gave up when I realised the
task was akin to placing grains of rice on a chessboard. And the manuscripts
................

Oh - your list of daemons. The "Dictionary of Angels" (including fallen
angels) is ~400 pages long. You could be writing for some time.
