   Family Life Among The Awakened
  </h1>
  <i>
   by Anders Sandberg

  <p>
   Having a family and loved ones gives purpose and joy to the
  lives of most people - but mages are cursed and blessed with
  their own high purposes and duties. Their perspective alienates
  them from mortals and mortal feelings (although not even the most
  powerful masters can escape them), rips them away from their old
  friends and relatives and compels them to seek mysteries far
  outside the world of the Sleepers.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is a sad fact that love between mages and Sleepers seldom
  work out, the gulf is too wide despite the best intentions from
  both sides. As Masters sometime advise their students: "
   <i>
    Love
  lifts the mortals towards Ascension, but pushes the mages into
  the Abyss
   </i>
   ". The combination of uncontrollable passion, the
  dynamic urge towards Ascension and reality-warping power is a
  volatile mix.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some mages fall in love with normal sleepers, and soon realise
  that they see the world completely differently. They cannot
  reveal the truths they see to their partners, at least not fully,
  and thus they are forced to lie or withhold - unless they try
  show the truth, which could have profound consequences. Some
  people can accept the huge, dark world they have so far been
  protected from - others flee in panic or go mad. The worst thing
  is that by just being near to a mage, the lover will risk being
  drawn into the supernatural conflicts - which is usually deadly
  for a mortal.
  </p>
  <p>
   When two mages fall in love the results are even more
  unpredictable. Each person is a dynamic, powerful individual used
  to manipulate reality itself, which means that the least conflict
  or dissonance can have disastrous effects. This is especially
  problematic for mages of different traditions, where the
  perspectives and realities collide. Sometimes they mesh, and in
  these rare cases the bond between the mages can become stronger
  than anything in the world. But sadly, in most cases the mages
  find that the pull of Ascension draws them apart.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some mages try to follow the middle road, and live with
  acolytes or students. This avoids the problems of having to hide
  your true nature from your partner and incompatibility of
  paradigm, but it will be a very unequal relationship. More than
  one acolyte has felt suffocated or inferior to the mage. A few
  mages have even had relationships with other beings, like
  spirits, garou, faeries and even vampires, but this is
  exceedingly rare.
  </p>
  <p>
   Several traditions encourage (or require) celibacy among their
  members, most notably the Celestial Chorus, Akashic Brotherhood
  and Order of Hermes. Among many mystical groups it has been known
  for millennia that sexual (and sometimes emotional) abstinence
  concentrates the magical forces and sharpens the will of the
  mage. There is also a practical reason: by avoiding the ties of
  love and family, the mage is free to participate in the Great
  Work.
  </p>
  <p>
   According to widespread myth the Sons of Ether and Virtual
  Adepts are romantically and socially incompetent, but this isn't
  true in general. However, it is no secret that many Virtual
  Adepts disdain their physical bodies and either sublimate their
  urges or prefer sex (and romance) on the Net before the real
  thing. Sons (and Daughters) of Ether are often too
  individualistic to get along with other people well, but
  sometimes their obsessions fit in with their partner, and the
  resulting romances make even the Cult of Ecstasy blush. Neither
  tradition has much interest in forming families, since it would
  distract them from their work.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Euthanatos are usually loners even among themselves, and
  having a family simply isn't an option to them - their calling is
  incompatible with family life and their foreswear it to work as
  gardeners among the mortals.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Dreamspeakers are also somewhat of loners, although
  usually less shunned than the Euthanatos. They often live
  slightly outside society, although they retain their ties to it.
  Few get married.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Cultists of Ecstasy often regard themselves as the experts
  on love and passion. This is partially true, but their
  adventurousness and rebelliousness usually leads to an endless
  succession of partners; settling down into a family is anathema
  to most cultists.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Verbena on the other hand regard love and family as
  crucial, and are among the most likely tradition mages to form
  families (that even work!), often with acolytes or even
  sleepers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Many technomancers (with the exception of Iteration X and the
  Void Engineers) also have families, usually sleepers. Due to
  their static magick their calling as shapers of reality is easier
  to combine with family life. It is very common for the family
  members to believe that the mage is merely working at some
  mundane agency, like a security firm, a large corporation, a
  biotechnological lab or in the government. Technomancer families
  in general have a very good material standard and usually
  function harmoniously (although they are usually somewhat
  conformistic). While the Technocracy encourages such ties to the
  Masses, It does not encourage technomancer becoming overly
  emotional about it.

   "Leon, I think we have to do something. I caught Niklas playing
    with himself."
   <br>
    "That is only natural, although he is a little bit young."
    <br>
     "No, he was playing
     <i>
      with
     </i>
     himself. They threw toys at
    each other."
     <br>

  While many mages (not to mention Sleepers) find love
  complicated and distracting, having children is much harder. It
  is rather rare for mages to have children, both because they
  seldom form families and because many realise the potential
  dangers.
  <p>
   Just having children is a magickal act to many traditions. The
  temptation to reach in and influence the development of the child
  is often too much, and mages "help" their children slightly with
  their magick. Technomancer children are usually free from
  hereditary disease and bad traits, making them bright,
  well-adjusted if somewhat bland people. Some mages go even
  further, as some Nephandi who warp the embryo from the beginning
  into a vessel for their masters.
  </p>
  <p>
   The main problem for mages having children is to decide to let
  the child go asleep in contact with static reality, or allow it
  to Awaken fully into a child mage. Neither possibility is an easy
  one; having an unawakened child is painful to mages, who must
  hide their true nature from it lest it brings down paradox, and
  child mages are dangerous both to themselves and the
  surroundings. Some mages try to balance things by giving their
  children a very careful upbringing, but it seldom works.
  </p>
  <p>
   Child mages often lack a concept of paradox, especially if
  they are brought up in a Horizon Realm. When they meet static
  reality the chock is mutual, and more than one child mage has
  become marauder. Sadly (or fortunately), these child marauders
  seldom survive long before their inexperience destroys them. Some
  child mages learn to sneak around paradox and use coincidental
  magick, just as normal children soon learn how to sneak around
  their parents. But since they see the hidden sides of the world,
  they are also much more likely to get into trouble from them.
  Some child mages get involved with the Faeries and vanish into
  their pleasant Dreaming instead of remaining in the harsh world
  of their parents. Others fall prey to the dark forces in the
  world, and there are persistent rumours of widderslainte and
  adsinistrati who seduce children into the ranks of the Nephandi.
  And of course, the Technocracy will do its outmost to crush any
  reality deviance among children.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beside the immediate problems, most mages find that having a
  child will lead to other surprises. Many child mages quickly
  develop their own abilities that sometimes surpass their parents.
  Having a daughter who likes to sneak around using Correspondence
  or plays tricks with Entropy can be very tiresome, to say the
  least. And children often question the teachings their parents
  try to give them.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Technocracy avoids this by placing their children in
  education programs, designed to shape their minds and Avatars
  into an acceptable form. The Order of Hermes, Celestial Chorus
  and Akashic Brotherhood also believe in educating their children,
  although in very different ways. While the latter two often place
  them in monastic schools to strengthen their minds and souls,
  hermetic mages often take their own children as apprentices and
  teach them about the mysteries and arts. The more nature-oriented
  traditions often let their children learn together with the other
  children of the tribe or village - it is just as important to be
  part of the community as to learn about the world. Especially the
  Dreamspeakers often function as teachers; while they seldom have
  children of their own, they sometimes adopt or take care of the
  children of others.
  </p>
  <p>
   There are always exceptions. Some technomancer youngsters
  rebel at their parents and become Hollow Ones. There are loving
  Virtual Adept mothers married to Cultists of Ecstasy. There are
  even Marauders who take an interest in their children. Only one
  thing is certain: the family life of the Awakened is seldom
  predictable, and sometimes it can be downright dangerous.
