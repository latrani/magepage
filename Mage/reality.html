    The Art and Science of Spreading your Reality
   </h2>
   <hr>
    I have been thinking about the Technomancers and their grip on
  reality. How do they do it? How do you change reality on a large
  scale?
    <p>
     According to the Metaphysics of Magick, reality is defined by
  what people believe. So, if many people believe in a possible
  reality it will become strong, and reinforce itself among the
  believers. But not only that, it will also influence people who
  don't believe in it. This will slowly force them to accept the
  dominant reality. Thus, control the ideas of people and control
  how reality works. But this is not enough, since any Tradition
  worth its salt also will want to control people in general.
  Controlling reality is a great step in the right direction, but
  not enough. People should also do what you want, to achieve
  Ascension.
    </p>
    <p>
     One aspect of the Technocracy that is stressed much in Mage is
  their control of technology, it have even given them their name.
  But is this enough? Technology and science have changed the
  perceptions of reality enormously the last centuries. But they
  are not alone. Politics, economy and culture have also had a
  enormous influence on how people in general perceive reality.
  They have of course been somewhat changed by the new technology,
  but in my opinion they have also been deliberately changed by the
  Technocracy to suit its needs.
    </p>
    <p>
     The art and science of reality engineering have a long
  tradition among mages, but it was probably first consciously
  formulated by the Technomancers. Earlier mages had tried to
  influence reality in many ways, mostly on the local scale in
  response to local problems. The Technomancers realized that it
  could be used on a global scale. They probably did a few tests of
  their theories and formulated the guiding principles (it might
  very possibly have been a technomancer who realized that "Belief
  =3D Reality" even among sleepers). Then they went to work on
  their grand plan towards ascension.
    </p>
    <p>
     The other Traditions were taken by surprise by the well
  coordinated effort, and before they could react together it was
  too late. While they today have understood most of the basics of
  paradigm engineering, they have not been able to gain the
  efficiency the Technomancers have achieved. The Technocracy lead
  will probably remain for the foreseeable future.=20
    </p>
    <h2>
     Economy for Fun and Profit
    </h2>
    <hr>
     For example, let's take a look on European economics during the
  middle ages. The only true capital was land. There was no
  widespread currency, since a currency implies a king able to back
  it up on a large scale. Instead, the king gave land as payment
  for service, creating the feudal system. Barter was the only form
  of economy used in daily life. This was a perfect system for the
  dominant Traditions in Europe. Celestial Chorus disliked too much
  trade and travelling, since it could disturb people from their
  religious beliefs. Their ideal was a rather rigid social system,
  where everybody bowed down to the benevolent Church (which they
  influenced). Order of Hermes generally believed in a elite of
  enlightened and learned men, who wisely counselled the nobility.
  The peasants should learn to fear and awe the mighty and
  benevolent mages, who knew all the secrets of the Universe.
  Verbena didn't care about economy, mostly about the importance of
  the living land ("The king and the land is one").
     <p>
      This structure was not what the Technocracy wanted. They
  realized that they had to change society completely to achieve
  their aims. Thus they began undermining the situation in many
  ways. The rivalry between Celestial Chorus and Order of Hermes
  and the formation of the Camarilla were fortuitous events (Or
  were they planned?). They began subtle manipulations of the
  Dominion and the leylines using the cathedrals. But most
  important, they needed to spread their ideas to a large number of
  people quickly. But communications were far to slow, and foreign
  people and ideas were met with distrust. So, they decided to
  increase trade.
     </p>
     <p>
      The decline of the Church led to an increased interest in
  worldly things, encouraged by the Technocracy. They also
  encouraged the creation of nation states, which greatly
  simplified commerce. Trading houses gained influence while the
  feudal nobility declined, and often supported the new kings
  (while they were supported by the Technocracy in turn). The
  discovery of the New World led to an inflow of new wealth which
  were used by the nobility (who had already discovered that
  luxuries were necessary after meeting oriental riches in the
  crusades). Since luxuries had to be imported, new trade-routes
  must be opened, and merchants began to grow in power and wealth.
  The trade with the orient also led to an influx of new ideas (and
  many Technomancer ideas hidden among them). The old, static
  feudal society was replaced fairly quickly (in only about 200
  years) with a dynamic, evolving society that the Technocracy had
  shaped.
     </p>
     <p>
      When the renaissance came, the Technocracy began to spread its
  ideas about how reality worked to an interested audience. People
  had lost their interest in the unworldly ideas of the Church and
  had found that they could make a profit by learning things about
  the real world. The Technocracy supplied them with new facts and
  ideas, which spread quickly using the printing press. A bit of
  encouragement to Martin Luther, and the Reformation began the
  final undermining of the dominance of religion over society.
  Copernicus, Kepler and Galileo demonstrated to the learned world
  that the universe behaved predictably, and thus undermined the
  belief in the old authorities.
     </p>
     <p>
      The system of mercantilism used by the early nation states
  during the 16th and 17th centuries was invented by the
  technocracy. The state did its best to control the trade inside
  its borders, trying to unify itself economically as it had done
  politically. It introduced standard weights and measures,
  improved roads and canals, removed internal tariffs and imposed
  uniform regulations in place of the varied local regulations
  which had been introduced by local guilds or towns. All of this
  were of course exactly what the Technocracy wanted!
     </p>
     <p>
      Later, when the nation states were unified enough internally,
  they invented the ideas which led to capitalism. They also began
  to discredit the mercantile system, and introduced new inventions
  which could be used efficiently only in a industrial, capitalist
  system with much international trade (or colonialism).
     </p>
     <p>
      What about mundane power? This may be useful, but it is not
  that essential for enterprising mages. But especially the
  Technocracy have found a useful way to gain much mundane power
  and wealth. "The best way to predict the future is to invent it".
  If you are planning to change society, you will know what groups
  will become more important in the future. So, plant some agents,
  acolytes or friends in these groups, invest in them and wait.
  When the Technocracy created modern economics, their friends were
  already in place inside the trading houses. Thus they had an
  almost unlimited cash supply, and could influence the economy
  (and politics) of whole kingdoms.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Technocracy have done this the last 300-400 years on the
  really large scale. Since they are so far ahead, they have
  amassed a tremendous potential wealth. If they wanted, they could
  fairly easily liquidate gigantic amounts of capital or political
  power. But they prefer to wield it subtly instead of directly,
  letting their investments flow towards the areas they want to
  develop, and applying political pressure on the areas that they
  would like to change. They could, if it suited them, crash the
  whole world economy, but fortunately it is against their goals.
  For the moment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Note that the Technocracy seems to be originally from Europe
  (Quite possibly they started as a coalition of ex-members of
  Order of Hermes). As their power over Europe grew, they wanted
  more. Thus the Technocracy encouraged colonialism, since the
  Europeans spread their reality with them. Since they had
  originally designed the European reality, the Technocracy could
  give the colonialists almost free reins in their expansion. In
  the colonies the colonialists enforced European reality, often
  without even the Technocracy's help. The native mages and the
  native reality were crushed by the Technocracy as their realities
  crumbled.
     </p>
     <p>
      This is the true reason why Western culture dominates the
  Earth today, and why it has been so expansive. The Technocracy
  does no longer need colonialism, as their reality is planted
  almost everywhere. They still control the Western culture much
  better than other cultures, and use every means to spread it in
  the areas their reality still is weak. The next step is probably
  to use their new systems (television, movies, papers,
  telecommunications, easy travel and free trade) to create the
  Global Village, thus creating one, global culture the Technocracy
  control completely.=20
     </p>
     <h2>
      Freedom of Speech and Thought, and their Uses
     </h2>
     <hr>
      The Technocracy have not only influenced economy immensely, they
  have created it! The economy and economic history taught today is
  largely a Technocracy invention. The Technocracy have also been
  working on philosophy, law and culture. By introducing the
  liberal ideas during the 18th century, they created the
  foundations of modern democracy. A democracy is much harder to
  control than a monarchy, but the Technocracy had already enough
  power to control even a democracy, while the Traditions (who had
  by now recognized their mutual enemy and were trying to stop the
  Technocracy) had a hard time influencing democratic governments.
  Which of course were partially designed by the Technocracy. The
  rumor among conspiracy theorists that the Freemasons were behind
  the Constitution is almost true.
      <p>
       Almost any political, economic and juridical institution have
  been formed by the Technocracy. Today there are too many
  organizations to directly control, but it doesn't matter. The
  courts, the laws, the constitution, the democratic system,
  everything have been formed by them, and subtly reinforce each
  other and static reality. The Technocracy does not need to
  control everything, since most of the system works by itself like
  a well designed machine. Only when something unusual or
  disruptive occurs have the Technocracy to interfere.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conventions behind this is mainly New World Order and the
  Syndicate, or rather their predecessors. The Syndicate have
  evolved from an earlier convention responsible for economy and
  politics. The Syndicate have much more power than most mages
  realize. While the other groups wields impressive technology and
  have spectacular plans, the Syndicate works in silence. They are
  behind much of the System itself, and their most important areas
  of activity are completely abstract, and impossible to influence
  for most mages (How do you end the recession?).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the Syndicate control the flow of money, they can
  influence anything that money can influence. They can decide
  whether a certain movie should be a success or a flop (or even
  become produced in the first place). They can influence
  multinational corporations by changing the areas where profit can
  be made (not to mention their agents inside some corporations).
  They can change whole social structures by changing the economy
  (introduce the car, and it will be possible to live in
  suburbs.).
      </p>
      <p>
       By controlling founding, media exposure, agents and public
  opinion the Technocracy can influence the academic world. A
  theory they like can be helped, and others subtly discouraged.
  They introduced Psychology, Sociology, Anthropology, History,
  Philosophy, National Economics and other "soft" "sciences". By
  spreading the idea of psychology, they can make people believe
  that the human mind is a machine that can be adjusted, repaired
  and controlled. Sociology create models (realities) about how
  society functions (or should function). A sociological model the
  Technocracy like is successful, changing society. Anthropologists
  are studying other cultures, interpreting their customs and
  societies using their own reality (and thus forcing the studied
  people into safe reference frames). History is of course written
  in a Technomancer-friendly perspective, changing the perceptions
  of everyone about how it was. Thus it is retroactively changed,
  at least from a practical standpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that the Technocracy doesn't have to control every single
  intellectual. Most people follow the rules and guidelines the
  Technocracy have created, and only invent inside them. As in the
  case of economic and political institutions, there is seldom any
  need to interfere. A slight influence here, an agent placed there
  and a new historical theory is advanced. The intellectuals will
  do most of the work themselves.=20
      </p>
      <h2>
       Have you heard the latest?
      </h2>
      <hr>
       How does one introduce a new idea? The obvious thing, writing
  books and telling people about it may work sometimes. A rumor can
  spread surprisingly quickly, and a catchy song or a joke may
  spread far and wide. But this is not a very effective way to
  spread an idea into all of society, especially when the real aim
  is to change society in a large way. You will need to spread lots
  of ideas in your favour until something happens, and you are
  quite vulnerable. Using magick may work on a limited scale. A
  Master of Mind may spread an idea into the minds of anybody in a
  small town. But this is slow, dangerous and ineffective way to
  change society. Agents may give the right people pushes in the
  right directions, and hinder people with the wrong ideas.
  Infiltrators may try to change the views of organizations from
  the inside.
       <p>
        Patience is important. If you spread ideas you like, try to
  obstruct rival ideas and generally help the groups you have
  decided to "adopt", long enough, you will succeed. This type of
  planning may be far too long-term for mortal politicians, but not
  for mages (who are quite driven by their goals and have the Big
  View) and vampires. A fast change is often quite unstable, but
  when a change in society have been prepared for a long time it
  will smoothly adopt and nobody will notice anything strange
  (except awakened beings, of course).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Technocracy have managed to create mass media, which will
  spread their ideas globally. The first media they spread, mass
  produced books were used to plant their ideas among the
  intellectuals and upper classes. As time went on, they found that
  they needed more efficient means to influence people. Movies and
  television turned out to be extremely good ways to achieve this.
  They had the potential to influence the masses quickly,
  efficiently and most important, coherently. Two persons reading a
  book or a paper will not interpret it the same way, as much of
  the information is left to the imagination. But films and
  television programs will look the same to anybody watching, and
  the interpretation is narrowed.=20
       </p>
       <h2>
        Industrial Light and Magick
       </h2>
       <hr>
        Movies are potent tools, not just for spreading ideas. When
  someone watches a good movie, he will temporality believe in it.
  The collective power of the viewers is impressive, and can create
  lasting changes. By introducing ideas, symbols and points of view
  that should be reinforced, a successful movie will influence
  reality on a large scale.
        <p>
         Movies can create clich=E9s in the popular culture. For
  example, today everyone "knows" that Mad Scientists live in
  decrepit castles in Transylvania, gloating with German accents
  and always trying to create their latest evil invention assisted
  by their hunchbacked assistants. This have created a "belief
  field" directed against the Sons of Ether. Not only are Sons of
  Ether (and other "crank" inventors) easily type-cast into the
  role of Mad Scientists, by others, they subconsciously do it
  themselves. The fact that Sons of Ether isolate themselves from
  society is partially an effect of this, partially a defence.
        </p>
        <p>
         If a dreaming person will create a temporary realm in the
  chimerae, what about millions of people watching the same movie?
  Perhaps there exists "film-worlds", where the events of a movie
  is re-enacted. These worlds will exist as long as many people see
  the movie they are based upon, and then they begin to dissolve.
  Some classics may have become so imprinted in the culture that
  they persist, maybe in a somewhat mutated form as people will
  only remember some parts and misremember others ("Play it again
  Sam.").
        </p>
        <p>
         A possible example. The Void Engineers have some political
  favours to collect, and asks the Syndicate to allow them to get a
  blockbuster. The Syndicate agrees, and the Engineers write the
  script for "ET" or change an existing script. The Syndicate makes
  sure that Spielberg reads it and becomes interested. Then the
  Technocracy wait, perhaps lightly influencing the production at
  crucial points. When the movie is released, the Syndicate uses
  their power over media, public opinion and economics to make the
  film a blockbuster. Lots of people see it and are imprinted with
  the idea of cute aliens (And the nasty Men in Black who are after
  them.=20 New World Order didn't like that part at all.). Perhaps
  Iteration X asked the Engineers to include them; they needed a
  realm with the right type of reality to do some cybernetic
  experiments. If you look carefully in the background of the
  makeshift lab in the resuscitation scene, you will notice the
  Iteration X people doing their experiments.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some time later, the Technocracy have become aware of the
  possibility of an attack from certain denizens of the Deep Umbra.
  They decide to spread distrust and fear against aliens (Maybe
  this is New World Orders revenge against the Void Engineers?).
  They create "V". People are influenced to regard lizards from
  outer space as their enemies, and their seal (maybe stolen from a
  hermetic tome or a symbol the umbroods use) is shown as evil.
  After creating the initial series, which have repelled or
  discouraged the invaders the Technocracy create the second season
  to permanently reinforce the gauntlet (by increasing
  xenophobia)
        </p>
        <h2>
         We have Air Superiority and Magickal Superiority!
        </h2>
        <hr>
         Another important factor is "magickal superiority". When a
  Tradition dominates an area, reality will be influenced subtly. A
  town controlled by the Celestial Chorus will become more
  religious. A Virtual Adept controlled town will become more high
  tech, high speed and neophilic. This effect is partially the work
  of the mages, as they try to influence the surroundings (The
  Adepts will help pro technology candidates, make people more
  interested in computers and start innovative computer industry
  nearby). But it is also an effect due to the fact that the
  awakened mages are influencing the area simply by being there.
  Each mage sees the world in his own way, thereby imposing his own
  reality. When many mages see the world in about the same way,
  they will begin to exert considerable influence. This will,
  unless the normal view clash totally, start to reinforce their
  reality on others. It will not change reality altogether (the
  mages are to few for that), but it will exert a great deal of
  force. The effect is not direct, and completely coincidental. The
  town "just feels right" for the director of a computer industry
  planning to start a new factory. A group of hackers will decide
  to hold a meeting there, temporarily attracting many more
  hackers.
         <p>
          After a few decennia of control, an area will be quite
  dominated by the dominant group of mages. Normally it is not that
  clear cut, of course. The Technocracy dominate almost everywhere,
  but the local influence of other Traditions can be felt. Vienna
  have since time immemorial been a centre of Order of Hermes (and
  Tremere, with somewhat compatible opinions), creating a town
  filled with beautiful buildings and statues, libraries with old
  tomes, museums and old traditions. Silicon Valley have been
  Virtual Adept territory until recently. But a dominated area will
  of course attract new mages of the dominant tradition, since it
  is to their liking. Many members of Cult of Ecstasy will like San
  Francisco, and stay, thus enforcing their reality.
         </p>
         <p>
          This influence can be extremely subtle, and is almost never
  noticed by anyone living inside it. It will influence almost
  anything, the way daily living is conducted, the "feel" of a
  city, the type of business present and the magick of the area.
  Since the technomancers are dominant almost everywhere, they can
  exert a tremendous influence even without trying. Things that are
  against their paradigm will be hindered even without any direct
  intervention. This may be the true reason the Masquerade
  works.
         </p>
         <p>
          Having magickal superiority have another advantage if you want
  to spread ideas or have things happen that you like. Suppose
  Andrew the Technomancer is influencing City Hall. The other
  Technomancers will probably know about this (it wont do if they
  step on each others toes). Brigitte is at the same time
  controlling the media. She notices that some reporters are
  investigating City Hall. She hinders them subtly, and tells
  Andrew to watch out. The same thing happens when Cyrus
  discourages a citizens group that would have disturbed Andrew's
  plans. Technomancer projects will get support from a lot of
  independent groups, and opposition will become fragmented or have
  trouble, just by pure "coincidences". This is the "coincidental"
  side of the effect. In practice, the dominant groups policies
  will start to "implement themselves". The mages of the dominant
  tradition will know of the policies, and since they influence
  reality simply by seeing it, the policies will be subtly
  enforced.=20
         </p>
         <h2>
          Ideologies - Your Slaves and Masters
         </h2>
         <hr>
          There is an interesting reflexivity here. A Tradition creates an
  institution or ideology. This ideology spreads, thus reinforcing
  the mages view of reality. This will increase their power, and
  perhaps give them magickal superiority. This will enforce the
  ideology (almost anybody inside the influenced area will realize
  that the ideology "works", or be persuaded to at least comply.),
  and attract more mages from the Tradition to the area. By now the
  mages have no direct control over the ideology, since it spreads
  too fast and is too powerful to control directly. The only thing
  the mages can do is to try to influence it in the right
  direction.
          <p>
           The result is that mages control ideologies, institutions and
  the worldview, and they control the mages. A powerful ideology
  will influence even the mages who believe themselves in control
  of it. The symbiosis between mages and ideologies is extremely
  powerful, as both parts need each other. In fact, the Traditions
  can be viewed as mage- ideology symbioses. Their goals, ideas and
  worldviews are their ideologies. Each tradition seeks to enforce
  their view on everybody else, thus expanding their ideology and
  strengthening themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
           When Celestial Chorus took control over the remains of the
  Roman Empire, it was not a conscious move (someone deciding "Now
  we are going to take control over Rome. Marcus, you take care of
  the emperor..."). Instead they had created the useful religion
  Christianity (which did the work for their own, non-Christian
  ideology). Christianity spread, and they gained power. They used
  this power to spread Christianity whenever possible. This was not
  a completely centralized movement (although the Chorus are the
  second most centralized Tradition. The most centralized is of
  course the Technocracy). Cyrillius notices a chance to convert
  the local king, checks with his superior who agrees, and uses his
  magick and faith to spread Christianity. At the same time, many
  other choristers are working in other areas. And many priests and
  monks, unaware of their part in the greater design, spread the
  word completely independent of the mages. The end result is the
  supremacy of the Celestial Chorus and its goals.
