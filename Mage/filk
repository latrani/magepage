        I have exams, I couldn't sleep, and had nothing better to do, so 
sue me :)

        _It's a Dark World_ (Sing to the tune of It's a Small World)

        It's a world of death
        and a world of fear;
        it's a world so dark
        I'm glad it's not real.

        Through the hip and the gore,
        angst, page X and false lore,
        it's a dark, dark world.

                (chorus:)
        It's a dark world after all,
        it's a dark world after all,
        it's a dark world after all,
        it's a dark, dark world.

        When Caine killed Abel
        he was cursed to eat
        the most boring diet
        blood's the only treat.

        Tragic hip, politics,
        oh, the angst! that's in it.
        it's a dark, dark world.

           (repeat chorus)

        With the Weaver mad
        and the Wyrm more so,
        Gaia's only hope
        is Rambo with fur.

        Hopeless fights, endless gore
        and Cthulhu next door,
        it's a dark, dark world.

          (repeat chorus)

        The Technocracy
        says what's there to be,
        if you break their rules;
        "Paradox take thee!"

        Reality's not the same,
        - You are insane! <--\
        - I'm a Mage! <-------\---------- I think this belongs to Anders
        it's a dark, dark world.          Sandberg, but I can't remember. 

          (repeat chorus)

        If you thought that dying
        would let you rest,
        here comes Wraith to add
        more pain to your necks.

        Oblivion, Hierarchy
        is there no end to this?!!!
        it's a dark, dark world.

          (repeat chorus)

        Changeling's in the future,
        we've had some clues:
        they live in the Moon
        and the Courts are two.

        How much dark can it be?:
        Shadowrun, D&D?
        It's a dark, dark world.

          (repeat chorus)

        It's a World of Darkness,
        a world of fear,
        Geography's not there,
        neither's History.

        With really odd mistakes,
        didn't they do research?
        It's a dark, dark world.

        It's a Dark World after all,
        and it's owned by White Wolf,
        we enjoy it even though
        it's a Dark, Dark World.
