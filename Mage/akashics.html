   Secret Sects of the Akashic Brotherhood
  </h1>
  <h2>
   by Emrey Barnes
  </h2>
  The Akashic Brotherhood Tradition book
  for Mage: The Ascension is now available. A lot has gone into the
  book, but we couldn't fit everything. Here's some supplementary
  material on our martial mage friends. It comes from the author of
  the supplement and has the Mage line developer's stamp of
  approval.
  <blockquote>
   Each man belongs to a style which claims to possess truth to
    the exclusion of all other styles. These styles become
    institutes with their explanations of the "Way," dissecting and
    isolating the harmony of firmness and gentleness, establishing
    rhythmic forms as the particular state of their techniques.
  </blockquote>
  - Bruce Lee, "Tao of Jeet Kune Do"
  <p>
   The teachings of the Akashic Brotherhood are broken into four
  distinct Sects that each focus on the strengths of an
  individual's Avatar. Learning the basics of an individual Style
  of Do takes two to five years; initiates must complete this phase
  of training before being released from their mentors' direct
  control.
  </p>
  <p>
   Throughout history, the Orange Robes have been seekers of
  peace and knowledge and form the largest contingent of the
  Brotherhood. This Sect tends to reside within the walls of the
  various Xiudaoyuan (Chantries). Members of the Scales of the
  Dragon Sect, the Brotherhood's foot soldiers in the Ascension
  War, make up the second largest contingent. Members of the Yogi
  Sect manipulate their bodies and the spirit world by exercising
  intense rituals of self-denial. Through this they learn oneness
  with their innerselves. Members of the Blue Skin Sect are the
  rarest and most protected of the Akashic ranks; the Brotherhood
  considers those following this path of Do to be the most likely
  to achieve Ascension.
  </p>
  <p>
   Each Sect has its own specialty maneuvers and rotes that are
  taught only to Doists of that Style. Each specializes in refining
  certain Abilities and Attributes as well. Each Sect has secret
  hand signs in addition to those used by the Brotherhood as a
  whole, and the Sects often withhold knowledge of their mystick
  teachings from each other.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Similarities between Orange Robes and the Scales of the
  Dragon
  </h2>
  Both the Orange Robes and the Scales of the Dragon
  depend on the existence of the material realm. Initiates of both
  groups learn awareness of the physical world [Alertness] and
  their physical bodies [Medicine]. Orange Robes produce results by
  internal use of Chi, while the Scales of the Dragon instill their
  influence through physical, external efforts backed by Ki.
  <p>
   During the ongoing process of bodily purification, the
  initiate learns that everything around her has hidden weaknesses
  [Sphere of Entropy] that can lead to that Pattern's
  unraveling.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Practices of Orange Robes
  </h2>
  <blockquote>
   Seek to stabilize and harmonize the world, for it is what makes
    us. If we wish to be at peace, so should be the world. If we
    wish to be free, we must free the world of constraining
    preconceived perceptions.
  </blockquote>
  - Vibansumitra
  <p>
   The Orange Robes work to increase an individual's cognitive
  abilities [Mental Attributes, especially Intelligence] through
  reading philosophies and sutras and meditating upon the thought
  patterns that direct the actions of others [Manipulation]. They
  seek the answer to the ultimate question of the Cosmic All:
  "Why?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Orange Robes explore the world by defining circumstances and
  their effects. These students understand the necessity of social
  interaction and how it can lead to conclusions [Investigation]
  and control [Expression, Etiquette] of nearly anything in the
  physical realm. By understanding how a series of events causes
  individuals to react, the Orange Robes learn how to become one
  with their environment and thus blend into their surroundings
  [Stealth, Arcane].
  </p>
  <p>
   Hand positioning and meditative stances (sitting, standing and
  walking) [Meditation] augment the Orange Robes' ability to
  unleash the powers of the Mind Sphere. Thus, the initiate learns
  to mold the minds of others. As it is necessary to defend the
  Xiudaoyuan and Sleepers, Orange Robes learn how to bend hatred
  and evil back into the mind that projects them. Doing so,
  however, is greatly discouraged.
  </p>
  <p>
   Weapons, techniques and training help the mind find peace
  within itself and allow the Doist to release energies through
  Patterns other than her own. They also come in handy when less
  enlightened visitors come calling. This Style of Do enables the
  Doist to redirect the force of her enemies [Spheres of Force and
  Entropy]. Orange Robe sensei merely allow their enemies to defeat
  themselves.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Teachings of the Scales of the Dragon
  </h2>
  The Scales of the
  Dragon study body-hardening rites, known as "katas," to increase
  their physical strength [increasing initiates' Physical
  Attributes and combat Abilities]. Students are taught that the
  human musculature can achieve maximum potential through exacting
  postures. Motions of the arms and legs added to torsional
  momentum can also focus powerful strength into action
  [Willpower], and the yielding nature of the physical form can be
  accessed to absorb a tremendous impact [Dodge]. Awareness of the
  body [Medicine, Athletics] leads to the Doist's ability to
  inflict damage by applying force [Brawl, Do, Strength] to an
  opponent's body in an efficient manner. This impact can be used
  to disarm, paralyze or kill. Martial training continues into
  weapon forms [Melee].
  <p>
   Do of the Scales allows the initiate to gain a sense of
  distance between herself and her opponent and teaches that
  distance is, in actuality, no distance. This [Correspondence
  Magick] is the primary field of the Scales' mystick study, though
  many choose to ignore it for the more formidable branches of
  destruction [Spheres of Entropy and Force].
  </p>
  <p>
   Dragon Scale sensei realize that the best way to defeat an
  opponent is to avoid him altogether; when one must battle evil,
  however, one must do so without constraint and to the death.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Similarities of Yogi and Blue Skins
  </h2>
  <blockquote>
   Obstacles can be overcome; sometimes they take a blind leap of
    faith.
  </blockquote>
  - Cheng Sa, "The Avenging Woodcutter"
  <p>
   Yogic and Blue Skin Do Styles directly link the initiate to
  fields of study left hidden to most of humanity. Training of the
  mind [Sphere of Mind] and purification of the body [often through
  Meditation] are essential, as the initiate can easily be driven
  insane by the reality-manipulating powers of magick.
  </p>
  <p>
   Both Styles of Do teach the initiate to delve into the higher
  forms of spirituality and knowledge of the other worlds [Spirit
  Sphere]. The Doist must be pure; spirits are easily offended by
  physical beings. One must remain calm and polite when dealing
  with beings from the Celestial Realms. Initiates study many
  sutras in order to learn the secrets of the unseen [Enigmas,
  Cosmology, Occult]. Through training, the Doist gains insight
  [Awareness] into the primal nature of the Cosmic All.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yogi and Blue Skins tend to dedicate staves, pipes, fans,
  fly-whisks and other seemingly nonoffensive items as their
  (unique) weapon foci. To them, the "weapon" effects the flow of
  the Cosmic All through living beings [Sphere of Life], instead of
  manipulating the physical world as do Scales of the Dragon and
  Orange Robes.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Yogi Teachings
  </h2>
  <blockquote>
   All things ride upon an underlying current. Nothing is fixed.
    All things ride upon the tide. It happens. Fight it not.
  </blockquote>
  Knowledges specifically designed around the spirit
  world are known as Yogic studies. Interaction with other people
  [Social Attributes] is very important; many Do maneuvers taught
  to Yogi involve highly unorthodox and alarming activities.
  Sharpening the mind [Mental Attributes] also becomes essential;
  the Doist must learn to come to grips with an entirely nonhuman
  method of dealing with existence.
  <p>
   Yogi learn how plants harness spiritual energies that can be
  useful to humanity [Herbology, Medicine]. They study the sutras
  [Cosmology, Enigmas, Occult] to learn how manipulation of the
  environment occurs outside of the boundaries of the physical
  realm. Studies of supernatural life-forms [various Lores] that
  find their way into the Akashic Record are often written by
  Yogi.
  </p>
  <p>
   Akashic Yogi comprehend reality in a cyclic fashion [Sphere of
  Time] rather than in a linear one. Do maneuvers used to link the
  Stylist into the currents of time tie into the other walking
  meditations. The Stylist learns to "grip frames of reference" and
  manipulate them. This also helps the Doist to understand his own
  Drahma and that of others.
  </p>
  <p>
   The true master of the Yogi knows that all conflicts arise
  from the battling of supernatural and divine forces on a higher
  plane of existence. The Yogi knows that in order to beat an
  opponent, he must align himself with the entity in that other
  existence that is capable of defeating the opposing supernatural
  force.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Blue Skin Teachings
  </h2>
  Those who link into the intrinsic
  internal energies of the body and the Cosmic All, sometimes
  called Ki or Chi [Quintessence], are known as Blue Skins. The
  very nature of the Blue Skins is to become the archetype. This
  requires the Doist to perfect her being [All Attributes] to
  achieve a supernal state and to directly link into her inner self
  [Avatar]. By being strong in body, mind and social interaction,
  the Blue Skin learns to understand and manipulate the Realm and
  her own Drahma.
  <p>
   The Doist must be alert [Alertness] and contemplative
  [Meditation] and must understand the limits of the human body
  [Medicine]. She must understand the limits of her self and her
  environment before attempting to use magick; the power of the
  Cosmic All can tear the human form [Pattern] to ribbons if the
  All is accessed improperly.
  </p>
  <p>
   Blue Skins learn to manipulate the intrinsic internal natures
  of Matter and Life. Only the Oracles are said to be able to
  perceive Patterns, but the Blue Skin initiate's mind gains
  perception of them. Because Blue Skins strive to achieve a direct
  link to the Pure Ones [Ascension] and their inner selves [Avatar,
  Arete], their Style is the most elusive of Do techniques to
  master.
  </p>
  <p>
   Many Blue Skins become disillusioned and disgusted when they
  learn that their Drahma tends to deteriorate the physical realm.
  Their connection to physical existence, into which they put so
  much effort, therefore decays. A true Blue Skin sensei knows that
  all conflicts are different aspects of the Pure Ones exerting
  themselves against each other.
  </p>
  <h2>
   <a name="rotes">
    Rotes Inherited from the Sects
   </a>
  </h2>
  The
  following are rotes that have been passed down or have migrated
  from the four Sects discussed here. These rotes are available to
  any Akashic brother, but a teacher privy to such learnings may
  have to be sought to understand them.
  <h3>
   Bronze Body (*** Life, * Mind, ** Prime)
  </h3>
  The Dragon Scale
  Master Li T'eih practiced many forms of body strengthening and
  weapon deflection. Early in his Awakened state, Li learned how to
  avoid damage from attacks by angling his body and tensing certain
  muscles. Li trained for years before the ultimate state of this
  form was achieved.
  <p>
   [The Doist increases the density of her skin while
  concentrating on and reacting to the actions of her attackers.
  Specify the number of successes for duration of Bronze Body
  before rolling for the magick Effect itself. Remember that such
  improvement (i.e., the duration of the Effect) is only temporary.
  Bronze Body increases the difficulty of a single opponent's
  attack rolls by one per success. The Doist can apply this effect
  against multiple targets by dividing the successes between each
  attacker (two against the first and one against the second, for
  example).]
  </p>
  <h3>
   Four-headed Defender (*** Life, ** Prime, * Mind, *
  Correspondence)
  </h3>
  Ancient writings in the Akashic Record tell
  of a horde of Nephandi that threatened to fight its way through
  the Gauntlet to destroy the Temple of Inner Truth. Rivhaya, a
  Dragon Scale, set himself in the center of the Xiudaoyuan's Node
  and initiated this rote. Rivhaya sprouted three additional heads,
  two extra arms and two additional legs. Each head looked toward a
  cardinal point of the compass. The four hands took turns passing
  Rivhaya's weapon back and forth about his body. Rivhaya's face
  also contorted to give the Nephandi a false sense of security.
  Large fangs sprouted from his mouths, from both upper and lower
  jaws. His skin turned a bright red and his tongues a brilliant
  blue. Smoke rolled from his eight nostrils in thunderous clouds.
  In battle, Rivhaya scuttled about in a whirling manner, his four
  weapons attacking his most deadly opponents. His four heads kept
  him constantly alert so that no one was ever able to approach him
  unawares.
  <p>
   [Prime and Life modify the mage's body, fueling the larger
  Pattern with Quintessence. Mind and Correspondence allow all
  heads to coordinate the body's actions. Four successes enable the
  Stylist to concentrate on information gained through four sets of
  eyes.]
  </p>
  <h3>
   Summoning Walk of the Enlightenment (***** Prime)
  </h3>
  While
  crossing the forested mountains of Tibet for days without food or
  water, Blue Skin Brother Chang Ming came upon an Oracle
  performing a walking meditation. Silently, Ming stepped behind
  the Oracle and traced his footsteps; Chang Ming's mind was quick
  enough to make a mental map of the path for future record. The
  resulting Tome and those copied from it teach the way of the
  Summoning Walk of Enlightenment. By studying the record, the
  Doist learns to link his Avatar to the fast-sweeping currents of
  the Prime. However, Chang Ming was not ready for the depth of
  power that his newfound Style brought him. Ho Chow Fan, a
  Euthanatos mage, crumpled him to a mass of quivering flesh with
  the Bone Twisting Palm. Fortunately, with Chang Ming's last act
  of magick, he destroyed his copy of the Tome and kept it from
  falling into the hands of the Euthanatos.
  <p>
   [The Doist's Avatar fills with Quintessence, recharging his
  supply. The mage gains Quintessence at a rate of one per
  success.]
  </p>
  <h3>
   Walk through Walls (*** Matter, *** Life, * Mind)
  </h3>
  Oracles
  of the Blue Skins have long held meetings in secret chambers and
  have used this rote to enter those sacred and holy shrines.
  Legend has it that the greatest and most powerful Node points
  accessed by the Brotherhood Xiudaoyuan (Chantries) are also
  hidden. Many of these sites are long lost, given the
  Brotherhood's wish to keep them secret but to a chosen few. This
  rote is rarely taught and only to the most trusted of students.
  <p>
   [This rote allows the Stylist to walk through walls by
  disassociating her body from the physical relation of a wall or
  other solid object. When this process is complete, the Doist can
  walk through walls without leaving a trace. The Doist calls upon
  the amazing concentration of the mind to keep her alert to
  situations that are just beyond barriers passed through.]
  </p>
  <h3>
   Weightless Walk (* Mind, * Correspondence, * Matter)
  </h3>
  Chu
  Kwei, an Orange Robe, developed a Light Body technique to walk
  over surfaces with concealed weak points. Kwei was unable to make
  himself weightless, but could locate areas with good traction
  that would support his weight.
  <p>
   [Divide the number of successes achieved between multitasking
  and range of perception. Correspondence and Matter perception
  detect and determine the structural integrity and traction of
  surfaces. The mage memorizes the locations of "safe spots" within
  the range of his senses.]
