     Freeze Ray (Forces
  ••••)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    By use of this rote, a mage can suck the heat out of objects,
  quickly freezing just about anything. While this will usually be
  vulgar, you can occasionally get away with "Hey, a freon can
  burst!" or "Hey, he's standing under a tank of liquid nitrogen!".
  Essentially, this rote will do nasty damage to living creatures
  (Successes X 3 for damage) and render them extremely fragile.
  Clever folks will be quick to realize that just about anything
  becomes brittle if you drop it's temperature far enough, so it's
  great for defeating armor (I recommend blow off one point of
  armor per success on the magick test) and can blow out car tires,
  shatter hot objects when their temperate drops so suddenly, etc.
  For the fully Mr. Freeze effect, combine this with Matter 2,
  Prime 2, and you can actually make ice with your freeze ray.
  Great for trapping HIT Marks, covering doors, burying pesky
  Nephandi, etc.

     Water Breathing (Matter
  ••, Prime ••, or Life
  •••, or Forces •••, Prime
  ••)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    An excellent example of using different spheres for the same
  effect! Using the Matter/Prime effect, you conjure air inside
  your mouth or lungs ("Boy, he sure can hold his breath a long
  time thanks to all those tuba lessons as a child!"). With the
  Life 3 effect, you modify your lungs to take oxygen from water.
  With the Forces/Prime effect (and here's where it starts to
  stretch!) you generate electrical current inside your mouth to
  cause electrolysis, breaking water down into hydrogen and oxygen.
  Just silly enough to work!

     </span>
    </b>
    <br>
     <br>
      A truly vulgar effect, you use this rote to turn people into, you
  guessed, stone! Or, if you feel frisky, I recommend tapioca
  pudding or perhaps neon-purple plastic. It's a vulgar life
  attack, so you get X3 successes in aggravated damage, with the
  possible (ST's option) effect of rendering the wounds basically
  unhealable until someone either shifts your pattern back to
  normal (essentially undoing all damage) or cuts the stone,
  pudding, whatever free and rebuilding the pattern (normal
  Regeneration effects). Note: this effect even works on Vampires!
  Of course, the unlucky recepient of your hostile stare gets a
  directed dodge against the effect.

      Sleeping Beauty's Lament (Life
  ••••, Time ••• (at
  least)
     </span>
    </b>
    <br>
     <br>
      Use this effect to put someone to sleep for a long, long time.
  Either using the Dilate/Constrict Time effect, or "sending" the
  victim into the future. For each success on the effect, you dump
  somone into a longer and longer sleep (1=hour, 2=day, 3=week,
  4=month, 5=year should be pretty acceptable).

     Mind Strike (Mind
  ••••, Entropy
  •••• (ST may insist on
  •••••)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    Use this effect to essentially drive someone completely
  insane. By absolutely dissaranging their ability to think
  coherently, you can plunge someone into a whirlwind of screaming
  madness by surging information, replacing perception
  (hallucinations, delusions, etc.) and just generally making
  someone's life hell. Successes indicate level of disorganization
  (I recommend -2 dice on all tasks per success scored by the
  mage), though this effect is resisted with a Willpower roll
  (difficulty somewhere around mage's arete +3 or just plain 8's a
  good rule of thumb, each success killing one of the mage's).If
  you don't have Mind, you can also get away with using Life to
  induce schizophrenia, etc. or maybe even Spirit for partial
  possession!

     Alter Ego (Life
  ••••• (you might even finagle a
  •••), Spirit ••••,
  Prime ••)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    Use this rote to create another you! Yes, you actually create
  a full clone of yourself (to clone yourself might only require a
  3 Life, after all, it is your pattern, but, of course, that's up
  the the almighty ST) and put the favorite spirit of your choice
  into the body.Why the hell would I wanna do that? you ask! Well,
  it is an instant alibi and possible ally, allows you to be, quite
  literally, in two places at once and doing different things, and
  can make your life complicated to no end (it's like the Mistaken
  Identity Flaw, only better!) You and your ST could have hours of
  fun designing the spirit you stick in your twin. Want to avoid
  paradox! "Hey, meet my identical twin!"

     Monomolecular Weaponry (Matter
  •••••, Prime
  ••)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    Use this rote to create a sword one molecule thick! This
  weapon can cut through just about anything, and weighs next to
  nothing. It's pretty darn coincidental (unless you take to
  whittling through battleship plate or cinderblock walls), and is
  made even more so if you stamp Ginzu on the side! I recommend
  difficulty 5, damage is equal to the number of successes rolled
  to hit as automatic successes for damage, plus Strength + 2 in
  dice. Note that there aren't many things capable of parrying such
  a weapon, and armor might even be less effective (rating lowered
  by one or something along those lines).

     Getting in Touch with Your
  Feminine Side (Life •••, Prime
  ••)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    Need a foolproof disguise! Try transforming into a woman (or
  man, if you're already a woman, whatever works for you). It's
  pretty simple matter of just switching your systems over (simple,
  ha!) but the effect if spectacular. Just like Better Body, this
  effect can be hazardous to you from pattern leakage, so don't
  keep it up for too long. However, by fiddling with your
  chromosone patterns, you might talk your storyteller into letting
  you make it permanent (if you for some reason, really wanted
  too...)
   </p>
   <p>
    Note that with Life 4, you can do this to other people! Fool
  your friends, fun at parties!
