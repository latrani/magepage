Here's some interesting (hopefully) elements that have been added from my
campaign that might be of interest to the other VAs out there.  Enjoy.

NEW BACKGROUND

Virtual Library

This background can only be taken by Technomancers (including Virtual
Adepts and Sons of Ether, although it tends to be limited to the Adepts
and Iteration X mages); there are not enough members of the other
Conventions and Traditions to provide the requisite feedback necessary to
create a virtual library.

A virtual library is essentially an online collection of notes, history,
knowledge, rotes and the like.  It doesn't exist as written information in
tomes, as the standard library does, but rather as bits and bytes on
massive bulletin board systems.  The net effect of this is that there is
always a new influx of material being added as time goes by, allowing a
potentially unlimited source of knowledge.

The normal Library background provides a finite amount of study points (5
per background point cost) to the owner.  A virtual library is similar,
but instead of being a finite collection of information, it provides a
number of study points equal to the background point cost per month. 
Unused points from a month cannot be saved and are considered lost if not
used by the end of the month.

€       1 study point per month; local Virtual Adept BBS; a statewide
online network
€€      2 study points per month; a spoke BBS system; a multi-state online
network
€€€     3 study points per month; a hub BBS system; a countrywide online network
€€€€    4 study points per month; an originator BBS system; a worldwide
online network
€€€€€   5 study points per month; Crystal Palace BBS; the Digital Web

NEW ROTES

Telecommute (€€€ Correspondance, € Forces)

This rote allows the Virtual Adept to shift his location through All-space
without having to be familliar with the destination first.  It was created
by a Virtual Adept out of San Antonio that goes by the handle of Tex
Arcana.

In order to accomplish such a feat, the mage must set up a physical
connection with the location (usually by means of a modem, telephone or
satellite link to a computer, telephone or television).  Then, the Adept
uses Forces to get a fix on the energy travelling between the locations,
and Correspondance to tele-locate there by following the transmission. 
The mage appears at the other end of the connection, usually within a
meter or so of the opposite link.  Once he has arrived at the new
location, he now has a point of reference for later, more conventional
means of Correspondance magick.

Obviously, a few restrictions occur.  Firstly, there has to be a
connection of some sort.  A computer must answer the modem on the other
line, someone (even an answering machine) must answer the phone, or a
television has to be monitoring the broadcast.

Secondly, while the familiarity with the location is not a factor, the
quality of the connection is.  A better, shorter connection (such as a
local call) is much easier to trace than a long-distance overseas
connection.

One Success     County          Local call, radio transmission, UHF broadcast
Two Successes   State         In-state long distance call, local cable station
Three Successes  Country        Out-of-State Long Distance call, national
affiliate
Four Successes   Continent        Out-of-Country Domestic call, Telemundo
Five Successes   Planetwide    Overseas call, CNN

Lastly, the rote is not without it's hazards.  If the roll fails to net
any successes, the mage simply does not go anywhere.  If too few successes
occur, the mge travels to the limit of the applicable distance, then gets
kicked 'offline' at the closest location (in otherwords, if a VA in Las
Vegas was trying to follow a modem line into a computer in Seattle and
only got 2 successes, he'd zap along the telephone line, but end up
materializing somewhere in Reno or so).  A botch is even worse, as the
mage zips along the transmission wave, but ends up getting dumped in a
-very- hazardous location (transatlantic cables, low earth orbit
satellite, use your imagination)
