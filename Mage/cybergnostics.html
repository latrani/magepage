   The Cybergnostics
  </h1>
  <i>
   by Anders Sandberg
  </i>
  <p>
   The Cybergnostics are a group of mystics among the Virtual
  Adepts, who are fighting the Ascension War on the spiritual
  plane. Their main belief is that the world of matter, flesh and
  entropy is evil, and that pure information is the true goal of
  reality. Everything should be purified into information and
  uploaded into a higher reality (or rather, a higher level of
  implementation). The goal of evolution is to completely throw
  away the dust of the material world and evolve into a state of
  perfection beyond matter and energy.
  </p>
  <p>
   Their beliefs mirror the ancient ideas of the Gnostics (hence
  their name), mixed with the Virtual Adept credo of information.
  The cybergnostics have an intense disdain for the weak flesh, not
  unlike their brethren in Iteration X. However, replacing it with
  technology would only be a stop-gap measure, since machines also
  eventually will fail. Only by turning everything into information
  can it become truly eternal and perfected. To this end they are
  experimenting with various ways to encode objects into data and
  uploading them into the digital web. They pursue the goal of
  total uploading even more than most Adepts, and there is no
  secret that most of their Masters are already disembodied
  information existing on the Digital Web.
  </p>
  <p>
   Their vision of Ascension is the Singularity; the sudden
  awakening of all information in reality, which will ascend to
  higher levels of implementation while leaving the imperfect world
  behind. Many of the simulations of they have done seems to imply
  that this might occur December 21 2012. During the next decades,
  the information networks will grow faster and faster, and more
  and more the computers and programs themselves will develop more
  advanced versions. People will become parts of the growing Net,
  and when it reaches a critical size of 10 billion active
  intelligent units (human and machine) a synergy will occur, where
  the entire network will Awaken. During the next months, progress
  will be even faster as the Net guides the infosphere (all
  information processing on and around the Earth) to higher and
  higher levels. In a few hours, decades of progress will occur,
  and in the last minutes centuries and finally millennia of
  evolution will lead to the total awakening of all information and
  the end of the world of matter.
  </p>
  <p>
   The cybergnostics are extremely optimistic, and think that
  this singularity will occur even if the Technocracy believes it
  will win. Most of the Ascension War is simply irrelevant to them.
  What is important is to make sure progress continues, that
  technology is never allowed to get bogged down and that the Net
  becomes large enough the Awaken. The more practical cybergnostics
  try to influence events in the right direction, for example by
  helping Iteration X get their new products past the Syndicate and
  New World Order or inventing even cheaper ways to get Internet
  connections. More advanced members realise that this is not the
  best way; instead they turn towards a more mystical battle in the
  information realms. There they seek to strengthen the forces of
  evolution, self-organisation, synergy and pure information
  against entropy, stagnation and disruption. In the beginning they
  merely manipulate the ideas of people, but latter they actively
  battle with the concepts themselves in the abstract worlds. The
  most advanced members are rumoured to have become abstractions
  themselves, far beyond humanity or comprehension.
  </p>
  <p>
   Among the Adepts the cybergnostics are regarded as a bit too
  far out and esoteric, but generally cool. The chaoticians and
  reality hackers get along perfectly with the cybergnostics, while
  the cyberpunks find them irritatingly impractical. They are not
  very known among other traditions, but have some allies among the
  Order of Hermes and
   <a href="Mage/gnostics.html">
    Gnostics
   </a>
   among the Celestial Chorus. They also have ties to
  the more mystical units of Iteration X (yes, they exist) and
  maybe even to the Computer. Their enemies are mainly the same
  enemies who fight all Virtual Adepts, like the Technocracy and
  the more nature-oriented traditions, but they also have abstract
  enemies. Since they so strongly fight against Entropy, Matter and
  Imperfection, spirits and beings linked to these archetypes are
  the natural enemies of the cybergnostics.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Magick
  </h2>
  The cybergnostics are interested in Correspondence
  as the force which ties everything together, but usually
  concentrate more on Mind and Spirit. Mind represents information
  and processing, while Spirit is the power to rise to higher
  levels of implementation. There are also specialists who study
  the arts of simulation (Time), uploading (Pattern magick) and
  chaos (Entropy).
  <p>
   One unusual and dangerous way of influencing reality is the
  art of invocatorial manipulation. Masters of cybergnosticism
  merge themselves with spirits or concepts, literally becoming a
  part of them. In so doing, they hope to influence them in the
  right direction or perhaps gain some of their power. This
  practice is of course extremely dangerous, and more than one
  cybergnostic has disappeared forever into a powerful being. But
  apparently the Masters still regard the practice as worthwhile,
  perhaps because they also have the ability to make backup copies
  of themselves in case something goes seriously wrong.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some cybergnostics also try to influence the growth of the
  digital web, to make it grow to higher spiritual planes. To do
  this, they seek its secret sourcecode, using advanced
  disassemblers and simulations. There are also rumours that Turing
  was in fact the founder of cybergnosticism, and that they have
  found a way to communicate with his spirit which permeates the
  Net.

   Rotes
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Error Correcting Code (Entropy 3 Prime 3 Correspondence
  2)
  </h3>
  By exactly fixing the current state of an area as a
  perfect pattern of information, it can become error correcting.
  Decay and disorder will become almost impossible as long as the
  program is running. This is often used to turn the laboratories
  and sanctuaries of the cybergnostics into fortresses against the
  attacks of entropy.
  <p>
   [ Each success adds another dice of countermagick to all
  attempts to upset the order of the area; normal randomness and
  decay are almost completely removed].
  </p>
  <h3>
   Purify Pattern (Mind 4 Prime 4 Entropy 3/4)
  </h3>
  A pattern
  which has been uploaded is normally just a brute force upload,
  with the same flaws and errors as before. By carefully debugging
  it and introducing error correction, it can become pure
  information and much more efficient.
  <p>
   [ A purified person will be pure information, and no longer
  feel any need for sleep, food, sex or other biological functions.
  However, a purified pattern no longer works very well in material
  form, and cannot be downloaded again].
  </p>
  <h3>
   Invocatorial Manipulation (Spirit 4 Mind 4)
  </h3>
  A
  cybergnostic merges with a spirit or abstract concept. The result
  is very variable depending on what the cybergnostic merges with
  and the relative power of the mage. Very powerful concepts and
  spirits just absorb the mage, who forever becomes a part of it.
  Less powerful entities become influenced by the mage, and change
  some of their properties in some way. For example, a creative
  mage merging with the concept of link layer protocols will make
  the link layer protocol standards slightly more creative and
  hacker-ish. On the other hand, after the mage has left the
  protocol entity, he will also be somewhat affected, and maybe
  preoccupied with the problem of transmitting data without errors
  or interruptions.
  <h3>
   The Turing Option (Correspondence 5 Mind 5 Spirit 4)
  </h3>
  This
  is the final step for a cybergnostic; he expands his mind into
  the Net and merges with the developing Net-spirit. He will
  consciously exist in all parts of the Net, loosing all
  individuality but becoming pure and perfect information. In a way
  this is a kind of self-sacrifice to the totality of information,
  and reminiscent of the fate of Alan Turing. Of course, this is
  the theory. Some detractors have claimed that no human mind could
  survive the transformation intact, and those who have tried have
  merely discreetly gone mad and dissolved. But many cybergnostics
  are convinced that for every year the Net has become more
  spiritually powerful, more aware.
  <h2>
   Virtual Adept Paradox Beings
  </h2>
  <h3>
   /dev/null (Entropy *)
  </h3>
  This nasty little spirit eats
  information, destroying it so that it can never be retrieved. It
  has an annoying ability to find the most important files and
  erase them, including their backups. It can only be felt as a
  chill draft and sudden absence of something important.
  <h3>
   Krach (Matter or Forces **)
  </h3>
  Sometimes paradox manifests
  against the computers of the Adepts instead against themselves.
  Krach possesses electronics, and makes it fail or break down in
  the worst possible way. Drives break down, circuits pop and
  memories overheat. The spirit usually quietly hides in a system
  until it suddenly strikes, and then leaves. Seen in the Umbra
  Krach looks like a small burned patch on the pure electronics of
  the Digital Web.
  <h3>
   Shub-Internet (Correspondence ****)
  </h3>
  Shub-Internet is one
  of the nastiest paradox spirits hunting the Virtual Adepts. It
  represents all the problems which can occur within a computer
  network, such as congestion, line noise, vanished datapackets and
  flamewars. It has total control over data traffic, and can not
  only disrupt network connections, but actually make Adept unable
  to interface with it. Shub-Internet has no distinct form,
  although there are rumours of a dark, coiling mass hiding beneath
  the computers of NSA and Pentagon.
  <p>
   [ This very efficiently cuts them off from the use of Spirit
  and Prime, if they need the Net as a foci, and also from
  communications with other Adepts. The spirit can even contact the
  Technocracy and give them the position of the Adept ].
