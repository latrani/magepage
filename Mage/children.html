    The Children of Antichrist are a group of satanistic orphans, who
  use their magick for fun and profit. Unlike most mages, who use
  their magick for some higher goal, the Children use it to gain
  mundane power, pleasure and wealth. This approach to magick has
  made most other mages to despise the Children. Their outlook is
  amoral, and often quite egocentric. Each Child sees himself as
  the centre of the world, and have decided that the rest of
  reality is there just to gratify his desires.
    <p>
     Originally the Children of Antichrist was the name of an
  influential group of Satanists, where several members
  spontaneously awakened. They influenced several other orphans,
  and the Children were created. Today the term is used to denote
  orphans who are influenced by satanistic philosophy and beliefs.
  Sometimes the term is used to denote any orphan who use his
  magick in an amoral manner for his own gratification.
    </p>
    <p>
     The most important thing about the Children is their
  nihilistic ethics. Might is Right, everybody is free to do
  whatever they desire. There is no right or wrong, merely success
  and failure. If a Child want to have something, he will get it
  without regard to what anybody else think or feel about it. If
  somebody try to stop him, it is their own fault if he hurts them.
  If they manage to stop him, it is the Child's own fault for not
  avoiding it. Everybody is allowed to do whatever they like to,
  but one must always face the consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Children of Antichrist see themselves as one step above
  the rest of humanity. They have the power, and anybody stupid to
  oppose them should be crushed (and if the enemy crushes the
  child, it was his own fault for being weak). A Child may decide
  to help somebody, but he doesn't have to unless he really want
  to. He might as well destroy him or ignore him, depending on his
  own mood.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Children are fundamentally anarchistic. Everybody is free
  to do what they will. Old ideologies, religions, morals or other
  societal structures imprison mankind, and should be destroyed. On
  the other hand, if someone is powerful enough to force others to
  obey him, he have the right to do it. Weak persons should not be
  protected. The Children respect strength in all forms, and do not
  care if the weak are hurt or killed.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Children are often quite materialistic, and many do not
  believe in God or Satan. Other Children claim Satan is a
  personification of the dark forces which exist everywhere. Just
  as God is an image of the inflated ego and superego of Mankind,
  so is Satan an image of the repressed desires and lusts of
  Mankind. Some claim Satan is a real being, perhaps a Celestine.
  Other Children believe in the Christian myths, and believe in a
  war between God and Satan. The Children spend much time
  quarrelling over the their different beliefs about Satan and God,
  seldom coming to any conclusion. Most of the Children couldn't
  care less.
    </p>
    <p>
     Due to their lack of inhibitions, many Children are destroyed
  by their own excesses, paradox or the Technocracy. Most Children
  don't care about the fact that they are balancing on a knifes
  edge, and find it exhilarating. Some Children realise the reality
  of the dangers, and control themselves. It is usually these more
  experienced Children who grow old. Some Children realises the
  errors of their ways, sometimes after an epiphany. Such converts
  stay mostly to themselves, avoiding contact with other mages.
  Some of the converts have however found their way into the
  traditions.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is a subgroup of the Children, much reviled by the
  others but still quite successful. These Children appear on the
  surface to be normal, well integrated people. They often have a
  good career, and good economy. They use their magick and lack of
  morals to gain power, status and money. They often work almost
  completely alone, without any true acolytes. Some of these
  Children have risen to the very top of society, where they subtly
  spread their influence. It is rumoured that they had managed to
  convert quite a few yuppies on Wall Street during the 80's. The
  other Children think these "Infiltrators" are traitors, who hide
  something they should show openly. Still, they are impressed with
  the speed the infiltrators spread their moral corruption,
  undermining society.

    <h2>
     Philosophy
    </h2>
    "These are the nine satanic statements:
    <ol>
     <li>
      Satan represents indulgence instead of abstinence!
     </li>
     <li>
      Satan represents vital existence, instead of spiritual pipe
    dreams!
     </li>
     <li>
      Satan represents undefiled wisdom, instead of hypocritical
    self-deceit!
     </li>
     <li>
      Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it, instead
    of love wasted on ingratiates!
     </li>
     <li>
      Satan represents vengeance, instead of turning the other
    cheek!
     </li>
     <li>
      Satan represents responsibility to the responsible, instead
    of concern for psychic vampires!
     </li>
     <li>
      Satan represents man as just another animal, sometimes
    better, more often worse than those who walk on all-fours, who,
    because of his "divine spiritual and intellectual development,"
    has become the most vicious animal of all!
     </li>
     <li>
      Satan represents all of the so-called sins, as they all
    lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification!
     </li>
     <li>
      Satan has been the best friend the church has ever had, as
    he has kept it in business all these years!"
     </li>
    </ol>
    From "The Satanic Bible" by Anton Szandor LaVey
    <h2>
     Organisation
    </h2>
    The Children are notoriously bad at
  following orders, tending to challenge authority at every step.
  Having too many Children in the same organisation is a recipe for
  conflict. Most Children break out of the organisation of their
  mentor after personal conflicts, and start their own. Many of the
  Children lead cults or informal networks of Satanists, or work
  completely individually. There are no global organisation, merely
  interactions between the children on a local level.
    <h2>
     Meetings and Theurgy
    </h2>
    There are no scheduled meetings of
  the Children. Some nights are more popular than others, like
  Halloween or Good Friday, to perform Black Masses or
  desecrations. The Black Masses vary from group to group. In some
  groups they are elaborate parodies or blasphemies of the
  Christian Mass, including praying backwards and the drinking of
  blood. Other groups have orgies with semi- mystic overtones. Many
  children do what they feel for.
    <p>
     Common for the Children and their acolytes to desecrate places
  or things, to show their contempt for what they represent and
  bring about their destruction. Churches and churchyards have been
  favourites for a long time, but some Children attack statues or
  government buildings. The more outraged people will be in the
  morning, the better.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Initiation
    </h2>
    Generally a Black Mass, where the candidate is
  confronted with the darkness of himself. The candidate see his
  greed, lust, pride and gluttony, and chooses to accept it
  completely. He swears an oath to do what he desires, and
  renounces all the old morals he may have had. Afterwards, he
  plunges into the darkness and try to do all thing he earlier was
  too inhibited or afraid for to do.
    <h2>
     Relations to other traditions
    </h2>
    The Children are despised
  by most mages. Most of the traditions actively try to counteract
  the children, finding them useless, rebellious and dangerous.
  They misuse their magick for mundane profit, and anger the
  Technocracy unnecessarily. Their most ardent persecutors are the
  Celestial Chorus, Order of Hermes and Akashic Brotherhood. Most
  other tradition mages are content to avoid them as much as
  possible. The only traditions which have somewhat amicable terms
  with the Children is Cult of Ecstasy and Hollow Ones.
    <p>
     The Technocracy hates the Children. While most
  non-technocratic mages are discreet, and avoid disrupting
  anything to escape notice, the Children often flaunt their powers
  in front of sleepers, spread irrational beliefs and generally
  mess things up all the time. The conventions are always trying to
  find the Children and destroy them (the current spread of
  "Satanic ritual abuse" rumours are a cunning plan to attack the
  Children by making people more aware of them and more inclined to
  report them to the "authorities". It will also be used later to
  discredit its current channels, striking a blow against religious
  fundamentalism and certain schools of therapist.).
    </p>
    <p>
     Many mages believe that the Children are a recruiting group
  for the Nephendi, or that the Children are a front organisation
  for them. In fact, it is completely wrong. While the Children
  certainly would have no direct qualms about calling upon
  Unspeakable Things from Beyond, they do not want to serve them.
  They do not take any orders from "below", any more than they
  would take orders from anybody else. If the demons and spirits
  serve them and their purposes, good. But if the demons try to
  order them around, they will find themselves thrown back into the
  abyss. Still, some Children freely co-operate with the Nephandi
  of different reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
     The group of mages with most in common with the children is
  the Marauders. The total freedom and anarchy of the Marauders
  appeal to the Children, and some join them. But most are content
  to lean back and watch the fireworks.

    <h2>
     Chantry
    </h2>
    None.
    <h2>
     Acolytes
    </h2>
    Heavy metal fans, Satanists, Nihilists,
  Fascists.
    <h2>
     Sphere
    </h2>
    None, being orphans. Many Children study Entropy,
  Mind and Life, as they are practical and of daily use. Some of
  the more advanced or serious Children study Spirit. Most of the
  Children rely heavily on coincidental magick to avoid arousing
  too much suspicion. It is common among the Children to learn
  several spheres to a low level instead of a few to high level.
    <h2>
     Foci
    </h2>
    While the Children are Orphans and do not need foci,
  many members believe they need "evil" to work their magick. What
  "evil" is, and how it is used varies quite a bit. Some Children
  chant names of demons, say blasphemies or pray backwards. Others
  use pleasure and vices like Cult of Ecstasy. Others use pain,
  blood or death as foci. Many vary their methods depending on mood
  and surroundings.

      Oh-so-mellow bastards! They spend their existence in
    sterile meditation. They are already dead! Life is the great
    indulgence, Death the great abstinence! They may know the sound

      If God really is on their side, how come they run and hide
    from the Technomancers? Can't he just zap them with a few
    lightening bolts? Or is he too weak? They are slaves. Their

      At least they know how to have fun! The problem is of

      These guys have understood a little bit. When they realise
    that the true reason they kill people is that they enjoy it,
    they will join us! Lets skip all this nonsense about "the Good
    Death", "Reincarnation" and "The Messiah". They might deny it,
    even to themselves, but they know there is only nothingness on
    the Other Side.

      Hollow, all right! They try to be dark and spooky, but they
    are really just spoiled kids waving around silver jewellery.
    They think they are dark? Hah, I would like to see their faces
    if I showed them what

      These guys have good ideas, but they are a little bit too
    much on the deranged side. While they share our philosophy,
    they are far too wrapped up in their own little dreams to take
    any notice of how nice the material world already is. Perhaps
    they spend too much time in the Umbra.

     <a name="rotes">
      Rotes
     </a>
    </h2>
    <h3>
     Sign of the Beast (Entropy 2)
    </h3>
    Used generally to freak out
  normal people (especially fundamentalists). When the mage uses
  it, strange coincidences start to happen around the mage. The
  shadow of a sculpture will look like an inverted pentagram.
  "Omen" will be shown on television. A swarm of wasps will land on
  the Bible. 666 will appear repeatedly around the mage, in card
  games, on price tags, on car plates and on calculators.
  Crucifixes will fall down from the wall, and when a book is
  opened randomly, it will tell something relating to Satan. [ Each
  success will increase the duration and strength of the rote. The
  more successes, the more powerful and unsettling coincidences
  will appear. ]
    <h3>
     Spirits of Delight (Spirit 2)
    </h3>
    The Child summons spirits
  who will give him some pleasure and entertainment. It may be
  spectral music, alluring scents, illusions of beautiful women,
  caresses and kisses or almost anything. The more successful the
  rote is, the more powerful spirits are attracted and the longer
  the effect last. Incubi and Succubi are material manifestations
  of quite powerful spirits, who only exist to please the mage (at
  least that is what they are saying...).
    <h3>
     Summon Lover (Mind 2)
    </h3>
    The Child uses his power over the
  carnal desires, and try to influence a partner. The victim will
  feel a subconscious desire for the Child, and will (at least
  sexually) be drawn towards him. Sometimes the Child uses a mass
  version, increasing his or her own charisma and sex appeal to
  arouse everybody in the vicinity. [ Each success will give one
  automatic success on seduction attempts. ]
    <h3>
     Curse (Mind 2)
    </h3>
    The Child curses somebody, often very
  graphically and often using some material implement (waving a
  entrails at the victim, or spitting at him). The child implants a
  subconscious desire to get hurt. The victim will often become
  unsettled, nervous or depressed. When an opportunity presents
  itself, the subconscious mind will try to make the victim hurt
  himself (or a love one). Some Children add Entropy to "give fate
  a hand", creating more opportunities for the curse to work.
    <h3>
     The Devil Protect His Own (Entropy 2)
    </h3>
    The mage "moves"
  some randomness to help him. The rote is done when something is
  going well for the mage or somebody in the vicinity, turning the
  good luck bad. Now the mage has some extra "fortune-capital",
  which will help him the next time he is near failure by turning
  bad luck good. This only works on random events, but sometimes it
  can work by creating random but helpful effects (the mage tries
  to explain his presence in the wardrobe to an irate husband with
  a gun, when suddenly the phone rings and distracts the husband,
  allowing escape.) The amount of good luck depends upon the amount
  of bad luck produced in the first step.
