  <h1>
   A Democratic Paradigm
  </h1>
  <i>
   by Anders Sandberg
  </i>
  <p>
   "But isn't that undemocratic, pater?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "I wish you didn't believe in those technocratic ideals so
  much, my dear Beatrice. Yes, our goals are very much
  undemocratic, as they should be."
  </p>
  <p>
   "I don't understand, pater."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Actually, democracy should more properly be called
  "demoncracy", because it is easily turned into a tool of the
  Adversary. Let me explain: are the people the ones who rule in a
  democracy? No, it is their elected leaders. But who are these
  leaders? Are they the wisest persons, are their devotion to the
  common good guaranteed? No, they are the ones who were best at
  convincing people about the righteousness of their cause, the
  best at gaining campaign money from corporations and
  organisations, the best at appearing in media. Nothing more. And
  thus the pawns of the Adversary can easily get into office since
  they are on the side of the glib tongues and money."
  </p>
  <p>
   "But you said these were technocratic ideals?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Yes, the Technocracy introduced democracy, to make it
  impossible for us to break their rule since only politicians
  following their paradigm would be elected (accidentally giving
  the Other Side an upper hand). And they clothed the idea in
  beautiful ideals of equality and fairness, while in reality it
  only supports their steel fist. Nobody dares, or can attack the
  idea of democracy openly today, so well have they succeeded."
  </p>
  <p>
   "But pater, we also strive for equality! Isn't Mankind a great
  choir that must sing together to Ascend?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "But a choir needs a conductor, otherwise it would become
  disharmonious even if all the members sought to sing together.
  All people are equal before the One, no amount of power can ever
  change that. Some people are suited to sing soloist pieces,
  others to join in the great and glorious choir; all sing the
  praises of the One together."
  </p>
  <p>
   "But I still don't see why the leaders are bound to be
  corrupt? After all, could not the faithful bring a truly good man
  into office?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Dear child, if we suppose that he could avoid the traps set
  by the Syndicate and New World Order, that he could avoid
  becoming corrupted by his power he would still be blocked by the
  other politicians, the courts, the parliament. The Technocracy
  divided the power between many groups so that only those who
  control most of the paradigm can manipulate it."
  </p>
  <p>
   "But what about our leaders then? Aren't they in danger of
  becoming corrupt too?!"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Yes and no. Unlike most sleeper politicians they
   <i>
    know
   </i>
   the truth, and cannot look away from it even if they wanted. That
  doesn't mean they don't make mistakes from time to time, after
  all they are just human, but they have seen the light of the One
  and are inspired by it. Some even say their Avatars advice them.
  Be as it may, but their faith and our faith in them keeps our
  choir strong."
  </p>
  <p>
   "I just can't get over all this! These ideas sounds more like
  they belong in the 18th century than the 20th; almost a kind of
  "the enlightened mans burden". Should not each person choose its
  own path, inspired by the One through the Avatar? Why can't there
  be any freedom in your world?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Beatrice, you have been talking with the Adepts again,
  haven't you?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Yes, pater..."
  </p>
  <p>
   "No need to worry, I wont report you to the Abbess. I
  understand your confusion, I was once almost as confused when I
  was an apprentice. I studied for my mentor, and he taught me how
  things was, and then I talked to fellow mages and they claimed
  things were different. Sometimes the differences were trivial,
  like the naming of the Spheres, sometimes they were fundamental
  like the nature of the One. You of course understand that this is
  a question of Paradigm, a way of perceiving the world. To a
  Virtual Adept the One is just a soulless big bang of energy and
  information exploding from pre-space in the remote past..."
  </p>
  <p>
   "But why can't we all just decide to believe in the same
  things, since reality is shaped by what we believe?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Beatrice, sometimes you are foolish! Do you think the
  existence of the One is something we mages could just decide
  about, like we decide what hymns to sing at mass?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "No... but that means there are some fundamental truths that
  we cannot change, doesn't it?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Some philosophers claim that we do not change the world
  itself by our beliefs, but that it is our perspectives that
  change. It is like looking at a complex object from different
  views, the fundamental stuff is unchanged but its properties seem
  to change as we change beliefs. It might even look completely
  different. In this case there are fundamental truths that are
  unchangeable, although it might be possible to look at the world
  from an angle where they are impossible to see or even
  irrelevant."
  </p>
  <p>
   "So the One exists, but it can be perceived from many
  directions? Like we do, or like the big bang of the technomancers
  or the Great Spirit of the shamans. All our beliefs are really
  the same at the core?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "You have been listening too much to those Adepts. Yes, we
  often believe in similar things. No, our beliefs are
  fundamentally different at the core. It is important to realise
  that mixing together the teachings and beliefs of different
  traditions is dangerous; you risk loosing your way and end up in
  a muddle of relativism where nothing is forbidden, everything
  allowed."
  </p>
  <p>
   "But..."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Let me put it this way. If I don't misremember, the Adepts
  use Correspondence by simply reaching into the datastructures of
  an object and changing its coordinates, a bit like they
  manipulate bank accounts. We of course see the sphere completely
  differently; to the One all places are one, and by reaching up
  towards this divine perspective we are able to appear or move
  objects elsewhere with the grace of the Highest. Isn't that
  right?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Yes, pater. Deacon Rheingold told me this was the reason some
  of us can glimpse the future and past, by reaching up towards
  aevum, the time of angels."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Exactly. And the One resides in aeternitas, the no-time
  outside the arch of time. But I digress. Now, suppose you spend a
  lot of time among the Adepts, and learn Correspondence from them.
  Then there is a good chance that you will see it as "twiddling
  bits" instead or reaching for the angelic world, perhaps as a
  combination of both like manipulating concepts on a higher plane
  using the computer. But this is inconsistent! To an Adept, there
  are no higher planes in any truly spiritual meaning, just levels
  of implementations. In our faith, it would be ridiculous to think
  that the unity of the One could be manipulated, let alone through
  a soulless computer!"
  </p>
  <p>
   "But it would work, wouldn't it?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Yes, and that is the most dangerous thing about syncretism.
  Most traditional philosophies are consistent, they explain and
  uphold reality. But if you start mixing and matching, then you
  loose this consistency. The world no longer has to make sense,
  since you accept inconsistent positions."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Didn't one of the Church-Fathers say "I believe because it is
  impossible"? "
  </p>
  <p>
   "That was something completely different. But at least you are
  paying some attention in class. As I was saying, loosing
  consistency is very dangerous. Your paradigm no longer has to
  make sense even to yourself, what you believe in is a matter of
  personal preferences. And one inconsistency will soon lead to
  another, undermining the whole structure. In the end you can
  believe in anything and nothing, everything is permitted and
  forbidden. That is the way towards becoming a Marauder or
  worse"
  </p>
  <p>
   "But does the other traditions make sense? I have heard about
  the ideas of the Etherites, and they sound completely absurd to
  me, not to mention those awful things the Euthanatos teach."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Not all traditions use our logic, Beatrice. It is very hard
  to understand what they think and see (and sometimes it is best
  not to try, as in the case of the Marauders and Nephandi), but
  each tradition makes sense to its members. Some traditions, like
  ours, have a more or less unified view of the world; we disagree
  on certain things but the basics are rather clear. Others let
  each member think whatever he or she wants and mostly keep
  together out of other similarities, like the Etherites. But all
  mages have to use a consistent paradigm to remain sane."
  </p>
  <p>
   "So that is why you don't want me to believe in democracy?
  Because it is inconsistent with the divine order, but not
  necessarily
   <i>
    false
   </i>
   in any absolute sense?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Exactly, my dear."
