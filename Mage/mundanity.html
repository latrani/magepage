  <h1>
   MUNDANITY: A TRAIT FOR MAGE
  </h1>
  <i>
   by Carl L. Congdon
  </i>
  <p>
   As a Mage, you will find that your life becomes a balancing
  act in a way you might not have expected. You want to save the
  world, sure, but can you understand it any longer? Does it even
  seem worth saving? If so, would you be able to explain your
  master plan to anyone in a way that they will understand?
  </p>
  <p>
   These seem like odd questions, but one of the crucial reasons
  that mages past and present have failed to bring about their
  much-lauded "universal Ascension" is because many of them have
  lost contact with the very Sleepers they insist they're trying to
  help. Even the Technocracy relies on Sleeper agents for their
  "pr." for this reason. It's hard to relate to humanity when you
  keep thinking of them as sheep (at best) and you as the
  shepherd.
  </p>
  <p>
   Even so, this distance is perfectly natural to understand.
  When you are capable of summoning storms practically out of thin
  air, or teleportation, or telepathic contact, or wandering into
  an alternate reality, it becomes kind of hard to relate to most
  of humanity, who can barely make it out of bed in the morning.
  How well are "normals" able to relate to the blind, or the
  crippled, or even the elderly with their (relatively minor)
  difficulties? It is even more difficult for mages to relate to
  Sleepers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to simplify an obviously complex problem, I have
  lumped all of these loose ends into a background that I refer to
  as Mundanity. It is a measure of how well the mage understands
  and empathizes with normal people. If a mage works in a soup
  kitchen and is active in city hall trying to make the world a
  better place, he is more likely to understand and have compassion
  for people than if he sits in a little room on Horizon studying
  ancient runes and symbols of Ultimate Power.
  </p>
  <p>
   As a side note to those who question the need for this
  Background, it is not a device to "create depth" or produce
  "angst." It is a fundamental exploration of the paradox of being
  a mage: In order to Ascend, they must eventually overcome
  themselves and their human understanding of reality. Yet it is
  their humanity that allows them to develop, grow, and interact
  with the "Sleepers" they are trying to help. It might help to
  think of Mundanity as a "counterpoint" to Arete; a representation
  of the shadowy un- conscious part of a mage's mind that doesn't
  want to understand everything about everything, but instead wants
  to have a happy, normal life surrounded by friends in a simple,
  easy-to-understand world. In other words, the part of the mage's
  mind that still thinks like a Sleeper.
  </p>
  <p>
   Put another way: have you ever understood or learned something
  about someone or something that you wished you could forget,
  because it didn't jibe with your world-view and consequently made
  you see things in shades of gray, instead of black and white? If
  you have, then you know how uncomfortable and painful that
  necessary part of life can be. Now imagine being a mage, someone
  who learns of something like that at least once a week, and has
  to keep on learning those things no matter what the cost, driven
  for Ultimate Understanding like a vampire for blood, because not
  doing so can be fatal or worse. Now you begin to understand what
  it must really be like.
  </p>
  <h2>
   GAME EFFECTS
  </h2>
  <p>
   Mundanity is basically a limit on how many dice a mage can use
  on her Social rolls when they involve Sleepers. They cannot use
  more dice than they have in their Mundanity Background. To
  Sleepers, a mage with a low Mundanity count is unnerving to be
  around and difficult to communicate with (and vice versa). This
  reaction is mostly unconscious and difficult to circumvent;
  however, at lower levels plenty of reasons begin to manifest for
  normal types to stay away from the mage in question. This does
  not apply to Awakened beings (vampires, mages, werewolves, etc.),
  or to "Aware" humans (those with Numina or who have had extensive
  contact with the supernatural), who may actually find the mage
  more interesting (although at lower levels of Mundanity even
  these beings may choose to avoid contact with the mage.)
  </p>
  <p>
   A starting mage has their Mundanity rating set at 10-Arete.
  Thus, if she purchased her Arete up to three, she would have a 7
  in her Mundanity Background. This can be adjusted upwards if the
  player has purchased Merits reflecting high involvement with
  Sleepers (any Ties, Nightclub, high Allies or Influence, etc.) or
  downwards if the player has Flaws of a psychological or mystical
  nature (Strangeness, Nightmares, Obsession, etc.) It is
  ultimately the Storyteller's call.
  </p>
  <p>
   There are many things that cause a mage to lose his Mundanity.
  Here is a list of possible causes:
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    Increase in Arete. This loss is automatic; the mage may not
    try to save his Mundanity. The loss is one for one.
   </li>
   <li>
    Failed Seekings or long, traumatic Quiets. The lower the
    mage's Mundanity, the more dramatic the failure or the Quiet
    should be.
   </li>
   <li>
    Prolonged exposure to beings or realities not found (or
    noticed) in consensual reality. For high- Mundanity mages, this
    could be exposure to vampires or wraiths, while for
    low-Mundanity mages, long stays in Horizon Realms or encounters
    with Deep Umbral entities will be more appropriate for
    Mundanity loss.
   </li>
   <li>
    Extended isolation from humanity. This does not necessarily
    imply going off into a remote location; it could also refer to
    losing touch with loved ones, not having a steady job, becoming
    obsessed with some idea or cause to the exclusion of everything
    else, or too much escapism. All of these things can push the
    mage farther away from her connection to humanity.
   </li>
   <li>
    Constantly keeping up the Arcane Background. This serves to
    isolate mages from humanity, and does have its
    consequences.
   </li>
   <li>
    Carrying around a lot (8+) of unreleased Paradox, or even a
    little Paradox for a long time.
   </li>
  </ol>
  Mundanity can be bought up with experience, just like other
  traits. However, the buying process has more to do with
  role-playing than just spending points. Buying back Mundanity
  below or equal to the Threshold Level (10-mage's Arete) costs
  (current*1) experience, while buying it above the Threshold Level
  (10- mage's Arete) costs (current*3) experience. Players should
  only be allowed to buy up their Mundanity after deliberate and
  meaningful interaction with the Sleepers. This could mean
  anything from falling in love (or out of it) to helping the
  homeless to simply calling up an old friend and watching a movie
  together to developing enthusiasm for something mundane, like
  sports or the club scene. Role-playing is the key in determining
  how meaningful the interaction is. Mages can also buy up their
  Mundanity by simply acting in character with their Nature,
  including the flaws inherent in that nature. The more "human,
  all-too-human" you are, the more you can empathize with other
  humans. Dropping the Arcane more often helps, as does not
  accumulating too much Paradox.
  <p>
   Like vampires, who roll their Conscience to fight the loss of
  Humanity, mages can also avoid losing their Mundanity. However,
  their roll is somewhat unusual: they have to fail an Intelligence
  roll. This represents the mage blocking off the event which
  caused her to gain a deeper insight into the universe,
  deliberately ignoring the deeper implications that event brings
  with it. The "lower" the difficulty, the more horrifying,
  fascinating, or downright thought-provoking the event in question
  is. "Failing" the roll means that the mage has successfully
  avoided thinking too long or too deeply about the event, treating
  it as an odd occurrence unrelated and unimportant to his
  world-view. "Success," however, means that the mage understands
  at least some of the implications and can't help questioning old
  assumptions that were pre- viously unquestionable. A botch means
  that the mage becomes obsessed about the event (as per the Flaw)
  or goes into Quiet, which could cause further Mundanity loss. A
  willpower point can be spent to turn a "success" into a "failure"
  (or a botch into a "success.")
  </p>
  <p>
   Mundanity loss is not restricted to encounters with the
  extreme or the supernatural; far from it, in fact. Moral dilemmas
  relating to the mage's interaction with humanity or other
  sentient beings are also good reasons for a Mundanity check. Here
  is an example:
  </p>
  <p class="c1">
   Elias DesChampes, Order of Hermes Disciple, is
  walking through the bad part of the city in order to reach his
  chantry. Along the way, he sees a young woman asking passersby
  for money, food, whatever they can spare. She, and the young
  child she carries in her arms, is disheveled, dirty and obviously
  malnourished. No one helps her. Although his meeting with his
  mentor is important, Elias wants to help. Suddenly, he recalls
  his mentor lecturing him on Destiny and how the forces of Entropy
  are vital to the function of the world, and not to be tampered
  with lightly. Seeing an obvious conflict between his
  understanding of the world and his human empathy, the Storyteller
  calls for a Mundanity check (difficulty 7; while the solution
  seems obvious, Elias is not social or particularly empathetic to
  the underprivileged.)
  </p>
  <h3>
   "FAILURE"
  </h3>
  <i>
   Elias squares his shoulders and says to
  himself: "Metaphysics be damned!" He helps the woman with mundane
  or magickal methods, insuring that she gets food and shelter for
  the night. When his mentor queries him on why he was late, Elias
  explains and asks: "What good is there in being a mage if I can't
  help people with my knowledge?" Perhaps he will even consider
  leaving the Order for a paradigm more human-oriented!
  </i>
  <h3>
   "SUCCESS"
  </h3>
  <i>
   Elias keeps on walking, congratulating
  himself for not unnecessarily interfering with the natural
  processes of reality. After all, if the woman and her child are
  destined to end up in that situation, then perhaps this is the
  best outcome that could be hoped for, compared to all other
  alternatives. Besides, Elias knows that he doesn't understand
  enough about reality to make those sort of "judgment calls."
  Elias loses a point of Mundanity as he vows to improve his Time
  and Entropy knowledge (and his Correspondence knowledge so as not
  to have to encounter these ethical dilemmas again; that might
  compromise his objectivity, after all!)
  </i>
  <h3>
   BOTCH
  </h3>
  <i>
   Elias becomes obsessed and observes the woman
  and child for a few days, deliberately not helping her or her
  child and using coincidental magick to discourage any "outside
  interference." The mother and child die from exposure; Elias
  takes notes. After compiling his data, he presents a formal paper
  to his mentor, which argues for similar "experiments" and
  suggests that maybe the Euthanatos/Syndicate/Nephandi have some
  valid theories on Destiny and Entropy which should be
  investigated further… Needless to say, Elias has lost at
  least a point of Mundanity, and probably made himself a prime
  candidate for Nephandic conversion in the process. But look at
  the understanding of Entropy and Destiny he gained in the
  process!
  </i>
  <p>
   Note that most humanity/true understanding conflicts will not
  be so obvious. But, at higher levels of Mundanity, even the
  little conflicts should call for a Mundanity check, while lower
  levels of Mundanity should be correspondingly more difficult to
  lose. A Storyteller is encouraged to make a "Hierarchy of Sins"
  customized for each of his/her player-characters.
  </p>
  <p>
   A smart Storyteller or player will notice the elegant bind:
  the more the mage truly understands *Reality*, the more removed
  she becomes from mere "consensual reality." In game terms, the
  more the mage gains Arete, or insight into the fundamental nature
  of the universe, the less able she is to interact with the people
  who live in it. Conversely, the more a mage clings to his
  Mundanity, the more difficult it will be to advance in Arete,
  even to the point where attempting to save his Mundanity by
  failing his Intelligence roll may cost him his chance to gain
  more Arete (but only at very high levels, say around 8+). She
  simply will not be allowed to go on a Seeking unless she gives up
  her attachment to these *outmoded beliefs* she calls "humanity."
  This is the paradox that mages everywhere face. The stress of
  developing both Arete and Mundanity at the same time with all the
  effort that implies is excruciating, and has driven many a mage
  to madness, self-destruction, burnout, or cynicism. But a smart
  mage realizes that precisely this effort was what allowed the
  early Order of Reason so many of its successes, while their later
  detachment from humanity is what allows the Traditions so many of
  their successes today. To those who seek an external form of
  Ascension, the pain is well worth it, and even those who strive
  for an internal Ascension argue that simply cutting off one's
  humanity is one more way of straying from the path to
  Ascension.

  <h2>
   The Effects of Mundanity
  </h2>
  <div class="c2">
   10. Normal human. Capable of enjoying gossip, popular culture,
    sports, Top 40 music, politics, and other "trivial" things. No
    one would suspect the mage is a mage at first glance. -1
    difficulty in any rolls dealing with Quiet.
   <p>
    9-8. Definitely offbeat or eccentric. "Trivial" matters do
    not much interest you, and you may find yourself gravitating
    toward the fringes of society to look for stimulation. Typical
    artist/bohemian outlook.
   </p>
   <p>
    7. You start preferring the company of the Awakened (or at
    least the Aware) to normal people. You have difficulty even
    feigning interest in what a Sleeper has to say. Normal people
    become uncomfortable around you (although some find you
    fascinating.)
   </p>
   <p>
    6. A psychiatrist would declare you clinically insane. You
    develop the Flaw of Confusion when around groups of Sleepers.
    You tend to drift away from mages who do not share paradigms
    similar to yours. Tend toward obsession in some personal goals.
    Must occasionally make a Wits + Awareness roll to remember not
    to perform vulgar magick in the presence of Sleepers.
   </p>
   <p>
    5. Obviously insane or profoundly disturbed. You become more
    concerned with abstract ideas and personal goals than with
    people or events. You gain one point in Arcane which you cannot
    shut off. You also gain the Flaw of Strangeness. -1 die from
    your Social rolls when dealing with Aware people.
   </p>
   <p>
    4. You live in a surreal, abstract world. Ordinary people
    would start to question your humanity. Gain another point in
    Arcane which cannot be shut off (total: 2). You sometimes have
    the Flaw The Bard's Tongue, sometimes not. -2 dice from your
    Social rolls for Aware people, and -1 die from Social rolls
    around Awakened beings, who begin to bother you (and vice
    versa). Gain +1 difficulty in any rolls involving Quiet.
   </p>
   <p>
    3. You appear completely inhuman to ordinary people.
    Sleepers appear to be about as sentient as ants to you. Your
    Strangeness Flaw becomes more potent, as once per game you
    accidentally set off a vulgar effect without realizing it. Gain
    yet another point of Arcane that you cannot turn off (total:3).
    -2 dice from any Social rolls involving Awakened beings; Aware
    beings now react to you the way Sleepers would. You have +2
    difficulty to any rolls involving Quiet.
   </p>
   <p>
    2. Your though patterns, your world-view, your daily life:
    three things that are no longer comprehensible to ordinary
    people. Being around anyone else, even mages with a similar
    paradigm to yours, is excruciating. You now have four points of
    Arcane that cannot be shut down. Gain +1 point of Paradox when
    using vulgar magick. -3 dice from your Social rolls involving
    Awakened beings. You now have +3 difficulty for any rolls
    involving Quiet.
   </p>
   <p>
    1. Extremely alien view of reality. Only the most abstract
    thoughts and beings can hold your attention for any length of
    time. You discomfort all Awakened beings, except mages, as you
    discomfort Sleepers. You now have 5 points of uncontrollable
    Arcane, and gain +2 additional Paradox when you use vulgar
    magick.
   </p>
   <p>
    0. Completely alien, even to fellow mages. You cannot even
    be classified biologically as human. One push could send you
    into Marauder-hood, or Ascension (or maybe both!) Gain +3
    additional Paradox whenever you use vulgar magick, and you have
    +4 difficulty with any rolls relating to Quiet. If you haven't
    confined yourself to a suitable Horizon Realm by now, you
    should, for everyone's sake.
   </p>
  </div>
  If the mage already has the flaws listed above, just use
  them more or make them more potent when his Mundanity hits the
  required level. Arcane does not add to the mage's total, unless
  the mage has less regular Arcane than uncontrolled Arcane; just
  treat some or all of the mage's Arcane (if he has any) as if it
  were constantly up. Paradox is only when the mage goes vulgar in
  Static Reality, but it applies whether or not the mage was
  successful. Just add the bonus Paradox to the total. Now you know
  why more Oracles don't visit!
  <p>
   In order to role-play the gradual inward focus of a mage who
  has lost Mundanity, it is important to know that, at least in the
  early stages, the Tradition of a mage will reflect how the mage
  acts as he loses his Mundanity. An Akashic Brother, for example,
  will become so focused on inner harmony that she may no longer
  want to grow and learn, because that would disrupt her precious
  stability. An Order of Hermes mage will lose her empathy for
  humanity and become more and more abstract and detached in her
  reasoning, and *humanity* will become one concept out of many. An
  Euthanatos will kill everyone who has not achieved his full
  potential, regardless of circumstances. Technomancers (including
  Sons of Ether and Virtual Adepts) become more focused on
  theories, gadgetry, and "the big picture" that on the human
  condition. (Think of Dr. Frankenstein!) Dreamspeakers become more
  attuned to the spiritual world, and less to the physical.
  Choir-mages may mutilate themselves to demonstrate their devotion
  to the One over the physical world, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
   Regardless, all mages who lose their human perspective share
  one common trait: their circle of friends and outside interests
  becomes smaller and smaller as they focus on more and more
  abstract pursuits. They even become detached from their
  Traditions as they slowly realize that much of the "truths" are
  just biases inherent in their metaphysical philosophies. Keeping
  this fact in mind will help players who are playing mages act
  accordingly. Remember, above all, that this is a role-playing
  game, and the above chart is a guideline, not a straitjacket.
  </p>
  <p>
   As a side, I do not wish to imply that a mage should always
  err to her humanity and all will be well. Many "human" traits
  that have held mages back from Ascension include: greed,
  intellectual sloth, power- lust, jealousy, bigotry, stubbornness,
  arrogance and hubris, etc. These too are part of the human
  condition. But becoming a pure mystick also has its price, a
  price any mage should tremble at paying. The solution lies, as
  always, in an optimal balance. Difficult as hell? Certainly, but
  isn't Ascension worth it?
