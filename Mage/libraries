I have been thinking about libraries. In Mage they
are all treated as equal, without any differences
between the traditions. Clearly this ought to be made
more complex :-)

The Order of Hermes have the classic type of
libraries: old leatherbound tomes containing arcane
secrets, veiled in metaphor, code and sheer nonsense. 

Celestial Chorus are somewhat similar, with their
religious libraries. Imagine holy books from many
religions, commentaries on them, books filled with
hymns and learned speculation about the nature of
God. 

Dreamspeakers do not use books, they use places or
objects as sources of knowledge and insight. An old
mask, worn by centuries of shamans contains great
wisdom, if you can hear it. In a cave the mage may
hear the whispers of the spirits. Old stories hold
ancient wisdom, if the mage learns to listen to them
in the right way. 

The Akashic Brotherhood prefers to meditate on
ancient texts, containing riddles, profound truths or
just beautiful poetry. The important thing is not
really the text, but the meditation that results and
hopefully leads to enlightenment. 

The Virtual Adepts use pkzipped packages of data,
containing .txt files, sourcecode, sample programs
and images. The important thing is not to read
the information, but to make the sourcecode to work
and experiment with it. 

The Sons of Ether have shelves filled with
"scientific" books.  Here you will find all
miscredited theories of the ages, from Orgone and
N-rays to books by Kerevan and "The Collected Works
of Robert E. Mcelwaine".  Probably also a lot of
plans for weird machines by forgotten inventors, a
few sketeches by Leonardo and a lot of Science
Fiction (for inspiration). 

The Cult of Ecstasy, Euthanatos and Verbena seems to
prefer to learn from experience, not from stored
information. I can imagine how a cultist perform a
series of carefully planned orgies to explore his
relation to the world, an euthanatos spends some time
talking to dying (or dead) people and a Verbena runs
skyclad out into the wilderness. Some Euthanatos
have piles of discarded papers, letters found in
garbage cans or suicide notes they study to understand
death and entropy better.

What happens if somebody tries to read the library,
but is of the wrong tradition? I think this is hard,
since the teachings of each tradition are closely
linked to their philosophy. So I think the student
must suceed at understanding the information first. 
The difficulty will depend on how advanced the
library is and if it is accessibly written.

Order of Hermes: intelligence + occult. 

Akashic Brotherhood: intelligence + meditation

Dreamspeakers: intelligence + culture

Virtual Adepts: intelligence + computer

Sons of Ether: intelligence + science/technology (depending on SoE)

Celestial Chorus: intelligence + theology (use Enigmas?)

(If "libraries" of the following traditions exist:)
Verbena: intelligence + survival
Euthanatos: intelligence + intuition
Cult of Ecstacy: intelligence + awareness

Any comments? (And yes, I know I have forgotten the
Hollow Ones. I just don't understand them...)
