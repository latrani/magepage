TOME OF THE UMBRA
TOME OF THE UMBRA

Compiled by Michael L. Singer, Void Engineer, from the material published by White Wolf Game Studios for -

Vampire: The Masquerade
Vampire: The Dark Ages
Werewolf: The Apocalypse
Mage: The Ascension
Wraith: The Oblivion
Changeling: The Dreaming

Also inspired by the material from -

Daemon: The Luring by Frank Torkel
Clanbook: Fallen Angels by Andrew Cram and Courtney Trinder
The Dictionary of Angels, Including Fallen Angels by Gustave Davidson
The Dictionary of Demons.  A Guide to Demons and Demonologists in Occult Lore by Fred Gettings
FORWARD

	This tome was compiled to try to put down on paper in one source all the information we know of the vast Spirit world we call the Umbra.  This, by no means, is the exhaustive list of realms and worlds of the Umbra.  We may never know the exact nature of 
the Umbra.  What is presented here is just some of what we have found to date and is expected to be updated as new discoveries are made.

	The information is broken down to fit the concept of the Three Worlds: The Low Umbra (Death), the Middle Umbra (Spirit), and the High Umbra (Ideas), with a separate section on the parts of the Umbra that transcend all three worlds.  Each world has a stru
cture similar to the following:

Earth/Skinlands
The Periphery/Haunts
The Gauntlet/Shroud
The Penumbra/Shadowlands
The Near Umbra/Underworld
The Membrane/Horizon
The Deep Umbra
