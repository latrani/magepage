    The Alchemists

  <hr>
   The alchemists are a sub-group somewhere between Order of Hermes
  and the Sons of Ether. While they use the terminology and symbols
  of the Order, they share the solitary attitude and the interest
  in the sphere of matter with the Sons.
   <h2>
    History and Politics
   </h2>
   The origin of alchemy is lost in
  time. Alchemists sometimes claim that the Art was created in
  Egypt, by the god Thoth (Sometimes identified with the Greek
  Hermes). During the Alexandran period (4th to 7th century AD)
  alchemy flourished. Alchemy developed, influenced by the Gnostics
  and by hermetic groups in the Mediterranean. Many alchemists
  argue that the great truths of the Art was first discovered by
   <a href="ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/religion/neopagan/Mediterranean/hermes">
    Hermes Trismegistros
   </a>
   (The thrice blessed Hermes), a mage
  somewhere in the first century. But it was not until the middle
  ages that alchemy became the Art known today.
   <p>
    The alchemists have a history of ignoring the politics of the
  Order. Like the Cabalists, they gained considerable influence
  after the fall of the false order. Disappointed hermetics joined
  the alchemists, and they became one of the most influential
  sub-groups of the Order during the renaissance. During this time
  the alchemists was the bridge between the Order of Hermes and the
  Sons of Ether. They could perform their arts almost in plain
  sight, as physicians and learned men. The ranked several famous
  mages in their ranks, like Artephius, Geber,
    <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd.dir/paracelsus.dir/paracelsus_1.html">
     Paracelsus
    </a>
    , Agrippa and count Saint-Germain. Some of these
  may still be around.
   </p>
   <p>
    The alchemists unwittingly created the ideas the technocracy
  used to create their chemistry and medicine, thereby slowly
  destroying the power base for them as physicians and
  pharmaceuticists. In fact, some alchemists joined the technocracy
  in order to help them create a true system of the science of
  matter. Newton may have been one of them. According to malign
  rumours among alchemists, the young Newton (hardly more than
  apprentice) had created an intelligence increasing elixir, which
  he used that fateful summer when he "discovered" the laws of
  mechanics and gravity. Afterwards he joined the Void Engineers
  (founded by Copernicus himself). But unfortunately his reliance
  on his secret elixir made him prematurely senile, a just
  punishment according to the alchemists.
   </p>
   <p>
    The alchemists became known as goldmakers and frauds as the
  technomancers grip on chemistry, medicine and physics increased.
  But the alchemists turned out to be a bit more resistant than the
  technomancers thought, and managed to survive. Today they still
  use their magick, using health food and alternative medicine as
  camouflage for their own medicine. Alchemical societies exist in
  many larger cities.
   </p>
   <p>
    The alchemists and the Sons of Ether are very close. Some
  alchemists have begun to use the methods of the Sons, trying
  electricity and the technical methods. Sons of Ether have been
  deeply influenced by the alchemists in their models of how the
  ether behaves (The alchemists claim to have developed the theory
  in the early middle ages, something the Sons hotly dispute). In
  fact, it is hard to tell where the alchemists end and the Sons
  begin. The most notable difference is terminology. Alchemists
  prefer the hermetic obtuse symbolism, using Cabala, astrology and
  the Greek gods in their magick, while the Sons prefer their own
  quasi- scientific jargon.
   </p>
   <p>
    Like the Sons, alchemists pursue their pet projects with
  single- minded determination, often not stopping until they
  succeed or fail miserably. If an alchemist have an idea, he will
  not hesitate to do anything to test it. This have led to some
  brilliant results, like Paracelsus Homunculus, but also to the
  early death of many alchemists.
   </p>
   <p>
    Alchemists do not engage in the Ascension war directly. They
  instead try to subtly spread their ideas, and sabotage the
  technomantic science. Their most successful method has been the
  spread of distrust against Technomancer medicine and the upsurge
  in alternative medicine. They have several times succeeding in
  turning technomancer pawns into their unwitting helpers or even
  convert them completely. Pons and Fleichmans cold fusion may have
  been a joint Sons of Ether-Alchemist project. Another thing the
  alchemist struggle against is fluoridation of drinking water. The
  alchmists suspect that the fluorides are used for mind-control or
  even nastier things. They have managed to spread much bad press
  about fluoridation. Still, the alchemists are hardly any match
  for the technomancers, but manage to survive due to their
  secrecy.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Alchemic doctrine
   </h2>
   The most important idea of alchemy is
  that everything is evolving. Everything will slowly become
  something more advanced given time. A child will grow up to
  become an adult. Stones will evolve into ore, which will evolve
  into metals or gems. Lead will evolve into gold given enough
  time. This evolution can be speeded up by the mage. This is the
  essential idea of the Great Work, the alchemists Ascension: that
  the mage, by his art, can encourage the evolution of everything
  into even higher forms.
   <p>
    There are three kingdoms: mineral, plant and animal. These
  correspond with the three alchemical elements (do not confuse
  with the classical four elements) Salt, Sulphur and Mercury. Each
  kingdom will slowly evolve into the next. A stone will become
  ore, which become metal, which become a simple plant, which will
  become more advanced plants, which will become a simple animal,
  which evolves into higher animals, which will become a man, who
  will evolve into higher, unknown levels. So far, the universe
  have not evolved very far, and the process takes a very long
  time, especially at the lower levels. Almost no plants derived
  from metals have appeared yet, and very few animals derived from
  plants.
   </p>
   <p>
    The alchemists try to understand the evolution of matter and
  life, by taking substances apart into their components, refining
  these and then merging them together again. This process will not
  only influence the substance, but also the mage. The whole
  process of transmutation lead into gold represent the
  transformation of a sleeper into a mage, or a mage into an
  ascendee. By mixing the proper substances, the mage will change
  himself. By changing himself, matter will change.
   </p>
   <p>
    The mineral kingdom is ruled by the seven kings: lead, tin,
  iron, copper, mercury, silver and gold. Since the mineral kingdom
  is the lowest and most fundamental kingdom, these metals are very
  important. The other mineral substances, like salt, sulphur,
  saltpetre, earth, gems and water are used in the alchemical
  processes ruled by the metals. The alchemist slowly learns to
  transmute base matter into finer matter, lead into tin, tin into
  iron, iron into copper and so on. This is a preparation of the
  Great Work.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Great Work consists of finding the Red Stone, also known
  as the Philosophers Stone or the Elixir. This (not only a
  physical substance but also a spiritual one) will transmute
  everything. Lead into Gold. Man into Superman. It is the
  alchemical Ascension, when everything will evolve into the
  highest possible state and the universe becomes truly complete.
  The alchemists want to hasten this evolution, by finding the Red
  Stone.
   </p>
   <p>
    Like the rest of Order of Hermes, symbolism is everywhere and
  everything is connected to everything else. Each organ of a
  patients body is ruled by a planet and a zodiacal sign, which in
  turn correspond to an element and a metal. To cure a heart
  disease, the alchemist would use elixirs containing gold and
  fire. Every plant and animal have subtle signs telling the
  experienced alchemists their uses and symbolism.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Philosophy
   </h2>
   "When handled properly, the base material will
  turn into The Black Stone. The Black Stone will be transmuted
  into the Yellow Stone. The Yellow Stone will become The White
  Stone. And the pure White Stone will become The Red Stone, known
  as the Philosophers Stone to the lay-people.
   <p>
    Do you understand? No, I didn't think so. The process is not
  just an chemical process, it is also a spiritual process inside
  the mage. And it is also a spiritual evolution of the world. When
  we finally have achieved the creation of the Red Stone, It will
  transform the whole world. That is why we are tirelessly working
  in our laboratories, to bring about the great day.
   </p>
   <p>
    How far we have come? Even if I wanted to tell you, you
  wouldn't understand anything. Misunderstandings can be even more
  dangerous than no understanding at all. Alchemy is the secret
  art, and not to be discussed openly. "
   </p>
   <h2>
    Organisation
   </h2>
   A loose network of individuals and
  alchemical societies. Most alchemists are solitary, with perhaps
  an apprentice or some helpers. Sometimes, especially in larger
  cities, they form alchemical societies, where they meet to
  discuss the art.
   <h2>
    Meetings
   </h2>
   Seldom. The alchemical societies sometimes meet
  on astrologically important days, to perform experiments
  together. Many alchemists schedule their work after the stars,
  planning so that it will be initiated and end on correct days
  (this may lower target numbers).
   <h2>
    Initiation
   </h2>
   Several years of apprenticeship is required.
  During this period the apprentice is often treated more as a
  janitor than a future mage. Slowly the apprentice learns the art
  from scraps of information, the rantings of the master and his
  own intuition. Some alchemists claim that the hard apprenticeship
  is necessary for to impart the practical knowledge and the
  burning desire to succeed a true alchemist need.
   <h2>
    Chantry
   </h2>
   Alchemists often stay at the chantries of other
  hermetics, but seldom found their own. In Paris there exist a
  alchemical society, founded by count Saint-Germain himself (he is
  rumoured to still be the leader), which have a secret chantry
  somewhere.
   <h2>
    Acolytes
   </h2>
   Amateur chemists, health food freaks, gullible
  rich.
   <h2>
    Sphere
   </h2>
   Matter. Alchemists often study Life almost as
  intensely as matter. Most alchemists start with Matter, then
  begin to study Life when Matter is mastered. Other common spheres
  are Prime, Forces and Mind. Time is very seldom used, due to the
  severe restrictions (see below).
   <h2>
    Foci
   </h2>
   Alchemists use chemistry (not the technomancer
  perversion of course, even if some alchemists are quite adept
  chemists too) as focus for all their magick. To perform a
  magickal effect, they must perform a alchemical reaction of some
  kind. The most used are melting, crystallising, distilling or
  burning. For example, a Ball of Abysmal Flame would require the
  alchemist to throw a mixture of gold and iron dust into a fire,
  which would explode. In healing, the mage would distil some blood
  from the patient with some copper- salts, and give the resulting
  fluid as medicine.
   <p>
    One of the good things about this method is that the alchemist
  does not have to do alchemical reactions "in the field", if he
  already have done them in the lab, and taken the end-products
  with him. The only requirement is that the mage is present for
  the final use of the magick. Many alchemists use prime or other
  spheres to create "one- shot-talismans", potions or substances
  that will perform their function even without the mage
  nearby.

     Heat. Fire represents the purifying force, which destroys

     Time. Alchemists using Time will perform a alchemical

    astrologically correct day. The time used depend on how
    powerful the effect is. A simple Time 1 effect is just a minute
    of silent thought (many alchemists use Time 1 to time their
    experiments), while a powerful Time 5 rote would take several
    months of time. The rote "Zen and the art of panhandling"
    would, if an alchemist performed it, perhaps consist of keeping
    gold and iron melted in a crucible for seven months, and then
    pouring the mixture into water, and drinking the hot water on a
    Sunday. Many alchemists prefer to allow their processes to take
    long time, just to be sure.

    <a name="rotes">
     Rotes
    </a>
   </h2>
   <h3>
    Light the Elemental Fire (Forces 2)
   </h3>
   The alchemist use a
  little lamp of iron filled with consecrated oil for this rote. By
  pouring some sulphur into the oil, the oil ignites into a pure
  blue-white flame. This fire is quite normal except its colour,
  and is used to ignite other fires in the lab (Sometimes
  alchemists use fire ignited by lightning instead). The longer the
  fire is kept alive, the more pure it will become. Some alchemists
  have fires which have been kept alive for centuries, passing from
  master to student countless times. These fires are almost
  talismans in themselves, and extremely pure. Their exact powers
  are not very understood, but they are generally sought after.
   <h3>
    Transmutation (Matter 4)
   </h3>
   The most well known rote of all
  alchemist rotes. The mage heats a piece of metal for a long time,
  carefully meditating on the true secrets of transmutation. When
  the metal cools, it has become pure gold.
   <h3>
    Growing Gold (Matter 2 Prime 2)
   </h3>
   Another gold-creating
  rote, this one invented by Nicolas Flanel (The alchemists need
  much gold to finance their expensive magick and for use in
  Prime). Since everything is alive to some extent, metallic gold
  can be coaxed to grow given the right nutrients. The mage places
  a small amount of gold in a crucible and adds another metal,
  preferably mercury. The crucible is heated, and the result is
  that the gold absorbs nourishment from the metal and the heat and
  becomes more gold.
   <h3>
    Elixir of the Sun (Mind 2 Prime 2)
   </h3>
   The mage mixes
  together mercury and gold into an amalgam. This amalgam is left
  in the sun during the day, and heated during the night. After
  several days, the amalgam is pulverised and added to wine. This
  wine will, if drunk, make the user to appear much more powerful
  than he really is. The user will, at least for a while, make
  people around him very impressed and awed.
   <h3>
    Love Potion (Mind 2 Prime 2)
   </h3>
   While most alchemists think
  this rote is a bit silly, they can't deny the demand for the
  potion. Besides, its a classic almost all apprentices want to
  learn. A typical love potion will work by making the drinker both
  susceptible for seduction and more amorous. The alchemist mixes
  mercury salts, rose water, expensive spices and a small amount of
  gold (preferably from a wedding ring or something like that). The
  mixture is carefully heated and then distilled. The distillate is
  added to food or drink.
   <p>
    [ Each success will lower the target number with one for all
  attempts at seduction or other amorous skills for the victim. It
  will also make the victim see every possible partner as having
  more in appearance and charisma than they really do. Each success
  will increase the apparent charisma and appearance with one.
  ]
   </p>
   <h3>
    Elixir of Longevity (Life 3)
   </h3>
   Another classic rote,
  invented in countless variations. The alchemist distils some of
  his blood, add expensive spices and salts, and drinks the final
  product. This elixir will halt the ageing of the mage for a time,
  but not rejuvenate him (there are lots of competing rejuvenation
  elixirs around).
   <h3>
    Reanimation (Life 3 Prime 2)
   </h3>
   The alchemist burns a dead
  (or alive) plant or animal. The hot ashes is mixed with exotic
  chemicals and salts. Finally gold solved in aqua regia is added,
  and the mixture is allowed to crystallise. By performing the
  necessary incantation and slowly heating the resulting salts, the
  mage will restore the being to life. If the mage succeed well
  enough, the being will be completely normal in all aspects. A
  less successful experiment would give a being which would die
  after a while, turning into salts again. And really bad results
  create "nothing but ye liveliest Awfullness". Some alchemists
  experiment with turning people to dust, and trying to raise them
  again. If anyone have succeeded, they have not told anybody.
   <h3>
    Homunculus (Life 3 Spirit 2 Prime 2 Time 3)
   </h3>
   Paracelsus
  developed this famous rote. The mage takes some of his bodily
  fluids, adds silver and gold salts, and pour the result into a
  vessel. The vessel is kept at a constant body temperature for
  nine months (In the middle ages, a heap of dung was used). After
  the time, a small, fully grown man have developed in the vessel.
  This homunculus is intelligent, have a will of his own and will
  grow at the normal rate after he have left the vessel. Some mages
  keep their homunculus inside it for safe keeping, feeding them of
  their own blood. Homunculi are often used as advisors, familiars
  or servants. But if the mage treat them bad, they may rise up
  against him.
   <h2>
    Famous Alchemists: Count de Saint-Germain
   </h2>
   Count de
  Saint-Germain, alias count Surmont, count Welldone, count
  Soltikoff, count Tzarogy, marquise di Aymar, prince Rakoczi or
  Ahasverus, is one of the most powerful alchemists around. Known
  as an adventurer, gentleman and scholar. Exactly how old he is
  unknown, as is his nationality. According to rumours he learned
  alchemy in Egypt, and is more than 2000 years old.
   <p>
    What is known is that he was in France 1748, where he moved in
  the highest aristocracy. He was favoured by Ludvig XV, and became
  envoy to Netherlands. Something went wrong, and he fled to London
  1760. 1762 he was in Russia, and then in Belgium, where he met
  Casanova. 1776 he is at the court of Frederick II of Prussia,
  where he entertained the King with chemical experiments. 1784 he
  officially dies in Schleswig, where he was building a
  paint-factory for the count of Hessen. But count de Saint-Germain
  continues to appear and disappear around the World, a bit more
  discrete after the technological age. For example, in 1930 he was
  seen on the deck of an Atlantic liner.
   </p>
   <p>
    The witty count never said anything direct about his true age,
  or whether he really could create gold. He was an fantastic
  storyteller, always telling stories about historical events
  almost like he had been there. Sometimes he made a mistake, like
  when he told his friends about the life of Henry IV "...and then
  the king turned around and smiled at me...I mean, he smiled at
  duke X...". The count never said that he was really immortal,
  just avoided the question. Sometimes he said "I just look younger
  than I am."
   </p>
   <p>
    Count de Saint-Germain is probably master of Matter and Life,
  and has a high arcane. He is regarded by mages as one of the
  greatest alchemists, and also as a true gentleman. The count
  seemed to spread the belief in alchemy during the period before
  the French revolution, but afterwards he has gone underground,
  only appearing from time to time to keep the public interested
  and irritate the technomancers. If rumours are true, he is the
  leader of an alchemic society in Paris for the moment, or he is
  travelling the world spreading the art.
