     Hi Anders --
     
     
     Love your page.  Love _Mage_ in general, in fact.
     
     Here are a handful of rotes I've been toying around with;
     feel free to post/modify/comment on them as suits your interest(s).
     
     Take care, Anders, and keep up the good work! 
     
              
                                     Sven Skoog
     
                    (whose terminal, unfortunately, has no umlauts)
     
     ------------------------------------------------------------------
     
     (Mind oo)    THE LUNATIC IS ON THE GRASS
     
                In many ways the opposite of 'Be Cool' (see _BoS_),
                this Rote instills the vague yet certain surety in
                observers that everything the target does is odd,
                awkward, unfashionable, ill-at-ease, graceless, and
                similarly inept.  
     
                Obviously, the exact effects of this are variable
                on the individual -- teenyboppers will find the
                victim's choice of clothing/jewelry offensive, while
                socialites and members of haute couture will find
                his/her manners boorish and rude, etc., etc., etc.
     
                Because the lack of fashion/etiquette/manners is
                perceived in the observers' minds, not in anything
                the victim actually wears/says/does, this effect, if
                successful, is nearly impossible to resist or shrug
                off until it has run its course.    
     
                A variant of this effect (still Mind oo) can be 
                placed on the victim him/herself, causing him/her to
                feel awkward, unfashionable, ill-mannered, and otherwise
                ill at ease in any social environment, whether or not
                he/she really is.
     
                I call this variant 'YOU FORGOT TO WIPE.'  ;)   
     
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     
     (Entropy o/oo, Forces oo, Mind o) MIDAS.EXE
     
                This rote, which depends rather heavily on the
                scientific paradigm (specifically, electronics and
                digital hardware design), is a favorite of malicious-
                minded Virtual Adepts (and maybe Sons of Ether)
                everywhere in need of cold, hard cash, and a longtime
                bane to the Technocracy's financial affiliates...
                particularly the Syndicate.
     
                The caster approaches an ATM (Automatic Teller Machine),
                using Forces oo to simulate a (nonexistent) magnetic
                signature on the metallic strip of an ATM card.  From
                there, he/she can directly interface a series of personal
                identification numbers at an alarming rate until he/she
                gets lucky (Mind o), pick a lucky number on the first or
                second try (Entropy oo), or perhaps even cause the ATM's
                security software (backed up by hardware (namely, fuses))
                to spontaneously jump states from 'authenticate' to
                'accept.' (Forces oo, Mind o)
     
                Once inside the system, the caster can, through 'random
                computer error' (Entropy oo, Forces oo), cause some 
                exorbitant sum to be deposited in his/her fictitious 
                account (this sum can be created from thin air or siphoned
                from a number of other (random) bank accounts), withdrawing
                some/all of it as needed (the ATM's daily limit can be
                surpassed using the same 'jump states' effect as above,
                although this will leave a record somewhere of an abnormal
                withdrawal).
     
                Most Adepts add insult to injury when finished with their
                'transaction,' burning out (Entropy o, Forces oo) a vital
                component of the system, or simply power-spiking it,
                shutting it down until reboot/repairs are made.  Sufficient
                degrees of control (i.e., high successes/Computer ability)
                may enable the Adept to wipe, head-crash, or otherwise
                efface the portion of memory containing the ATM's log file. 
     
                Note that the Technocracy really _hates_ this one, and may,
                depending on the level of paranoia in your Storyteller's
                world, implement tempest-hardened systems, technomagickal
                safeguards (recorders/countermagick), or even spiritual
                watchdogs (Pattern spiders and the like) to watch over any
                suspicious modifications to their electronic holdings.
     
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     
     (Life o, Mind o) HEIGHTENED SENSE(S)
     
          ...spelled like it sounds.  If more than one sense is augmented
             at a time with this effect, successes should be split between
             the two/three/however many senses --
     
                1 success     musician/refined human        (+1 Perception)
                2 successes   upper limits of human senses  (+2 Perception)
                3 successes   potentially vulgar extremes   (+3 Perception)
                4 successes   clearly superhuman senses     (+4 Perception)
                5 successes   rivals advanced technology    (+5 Perception)
     
          Extreme augmentation that lasts more than a few scenes should be
          subject to Pattern Bleed in a manner similar to Better Body, at
          the Storyteller's discretion.
     
          Note that, unless some explanation can be concocted, acting on
          preternaturally heightened senses could result in Paradox.  (Yes,
          there are supposedly a few people whose senses naturally extend 
          outside the human norm, although only they know for sure -- I've
          been able to hear the high-pitched KHz 'whine' most US television
          sets give off, for instance, since I was a kid, but have only 
          just learned that most people can't.  So maybe, once in a while,
          the mage might get away with something of the sort.)
     
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     
     (Forces ooo, Life ooo, Prime oo)   RIDE THE LIGHTNING
     
          Well, really, this rote is named for one specific (but useful)
          application -- the mage is able to transform his/her Pattern
          into electricity (or light, shadow, fire, frost, sound waves,
          neutrinos, or anything else his/her paradigm accepts as a 
          'Force')... which, of course, offers him/her several new and
          exciting opportunities for mobility and perhaps modes of attack.
          
          (Now, nothing extravagant here -- mages changing themselves into
           explosions, or pinprick gravitic wells, or some such, are all 
           the province of Forces oooo and beyond.  But something along the 
           lines of, say, that Glass Walker gift 'Surf Telephone Lines'
           ought to be possible...)
     
           Some forms, obviously, won't be too harmful to touch/be around,
           although even light might blind or be focussed into a laser.
           Various Storytellers may rule that Prime is not necessary,
           although, allowing for the grossness of Pattern transformation
           and Quintessence demands of a new (energy) Pattern, I'd require
           it.  A Life oooo variant allows the mage to affect others...)
     
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     
     (Correspondence oo, Mind ooo, Time oo) THE MIRROR HAS TWO FACES
     
          This seemingly innocent rote, like many such Time magicks, 
          can be both very useful and very, very dangerous.
     
          The mage links with his/her consciousness sometime in the future
          (via a sort of 'mind-meld') and, for a _very_ brief moment, can
          ask his/her future self the answer to a question, perhaps two.
          These questions can concern a probable outcome ('I'm about to
          invest $50,000 in Advanced Micro Devices.  What will happen?'),
          a future fact which is unlikely to change ('Who's the governor
          of Massachusetts in 2007?'), or various personal matters ('Is
          my marriage with Elizabeth going to work?  How much do you weigh
          in the future?  Did I/we test HIV-positive at that clinic?').
     
          Now, keep in mind that the time-space continuum (or 'fabric' or
          'stream,' depending on which Tradition you ask) is hardly 
          engraved in stone;  the powerhungry Adept who, learning that Paul 
          Celucci will win the Massachusetts gubernatorial election in 
          2000, decides to bankroll (and privately blackmail) him may 
          inadvertently find that his clandestine financial activities have 
          come to public attention, causing Celucci to withdraw from the 
          election.  In general, the less the mage attempts to interfere, 
          the better.  Also, past-selves popping forward in time may 
          unwittingly endanger their future-selves by distracting them at a 
          crucial time, or even call unwanted attention (Zigg'ra'laur, 
          Marauder, Technocracy, etc).
          
          It is said that the archmage Seer of Chronos, Zak Wells, after
          his infamous borrow-Quintessence-from-his-future-self stunts,
          knew of his death years in advance, and prepared his estate
          and affairs accordingly;  using this rote, months after the
          original Quintessence-borrowing effect, to ask his future self
          about the best course of action in an alliance he was pursuing,
          he found that he no longer existed there... his future self
          had been/would be killed by the Technocracy. 
     
         [The Correspondence Sphere is not required at all if the mage can
          make an educated guess (and be correct) about PRECISELY where
          he/she will be at the moment in the future he/she wants to reach.
          Similarly, no amount of Correspondence will be sufficient if the
          mage literally has no idea where he/she will be in the future
          (e.g., out of a job and forced to move to the Midwest, etc.), 
          although Filter All Time-Space (Correspondence ooo, Time oo) 
          might be tried, for a _very_ long time...]
     
         [Various bells and whistles can be affixed to this rote, including
          a Correspondence oooo tie-in that allows the mage to co-locate to
          the period in space-time where his/her future self resides, and
          even some Forces (oo) effects which enable visual interaction --
          but they are all unfailingly vulgar, some extremely so.]
     
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     
     (Correspondence ooo, Time oo)  FILTER ALL TIME-SPACE
     
          Similar to Filter All-Space, except, with sufficient successes,
          this effect can narrow down with some certainty where a subject/
          object will be, WHEN it will be there.  (Generally, the mage has
          to specify either a fixed location, or a fixed time;  filtering
          through time-space to find an unknown in both time and space is
          so daunting as to be virtually impossible (hundreds and hundreds
          of successes).)   
     
          This rote is very useful with temporal scrying or consultation,
          such as THE MIRROR HAS TWO FACES (above).  
     
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     
     (Life oooo, Time ooooo, Prime oo) TIME IN A BOTTLE
     
          Sort of a last-ditch longevity rote (and somewhat cheaper than
          the _Horizon_ immortality rotes), this effect actually retrieves
          a mage's physical/mental condition from the past, superimposing
          it onto his/her Pattern in the present... in effect, making 
          him/herself that much younger (exact amount success-dependent).
     
          Note that, because Mind is in no way involved here, the mage,
          unfortunately, will retain NONE of the knowledge, skills, and/or
          talents he/she has acquired since that far-off point in the past;
          he/she is, in fact, directly pulling a copy of his/her past self,
          _exactly_ as it appeared and thought back then, and assuming its
          identity in the present, losing all that has transpired since.
          Sometimes, however, even this fate is preferable to death -- 
          there is always the chance, however slim, that the mage will 
          'relearn' his present knowledge and personality, after all.
     
          This, potentially, is a very confusing and mentally turbulent 
          rote -- many who are not well-versed in the Sphere of Time boggle
          at the thought of a present self merging with a past self, and
          the potentials for Paradox this joining could trigger.  As such,
          the caster often leaves at least a short description of what has
          just occurred, cognizant of the fact that their past selves may
          be rather confused -- even though the past personality is the
          mage's own, this 'future self' he/she has become will seem like a
          mysterious, distant stranger.
     
          ('Dear Me:  At the ripe old age of 87, unsuccessful in my quest
                      to perfect the Phoenix Elixir, I have begun to fear
                      Death's coming, and have assumed a younger, stronger
                      (past) 47-year old version of myself in the present.
     
                      Unfortunately, this means that the past forty years
                      of My work are now gone from my/your mind -- but I
                      have meticulously catalogued My findings on the
                      shelves to your right.  Hopefully, over the next 
                      decade or so, you/I will read and familiarize your/
                      myself with My research.  It is My hope that, once 
                      you/I have grown into My present knowledge, you/I 
                      will expand upon the foundations I have laid herein,
                      perhaps even succeeding where I have failed.  
                      Failing this, at least (re)achieve Mastery in the 
                      Sphere of Time, in order to once again enact this 
                      past-present transfer and give the next iteration of 
                      Me another chance.
     
                      Good luck, and remember -- take care of yourself.
     
                                        -- Doc Eon, Man of Many Tomorrows')
     
          NOTE:  Much like Tim Toner's "Better Death," this rote should be
                 SACRILEGE to Euthanatos and similar cycle-minded mages...
