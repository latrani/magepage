Powers

     Infinite internal volume: Some sort of natural Correspondence Effect
     inherent to the Luggages' nature allows them near-unlimited internal
     storage space within their bodies. Assume a Luggage can store anything
     that can be fit through its opening, and can store any number of things
     without penalty.

     Umbral travel: Luggages possess an innate ability to break through
     Gauntlets, Horizons, and Pericarps. "Bash through", actually; a Luggage
     shifting to the spirit worlds literally smashes its way through the
     barriers. Luggages cannot botch this sort of roll.

     Owner link: The Luggage always knows which direction its master is, no
     matter how far away she is. At worst, the Luggage with have a general
     sense in which direction to go to rejoin its owner.

Description

     The Luggages are among the most coveted trade goods among merchants
     plying the Deep Umbra. Fashioned in some far-off Realm, the method of
     their construction and even their true nature remain mysteries.
     Mysticks who have attempted to classify them label the Luggages as
     "part talisman, part fetish, part familiar, and completely homicidal."

     At rest, a Luggage appears to be an ordinary steamer trunk made from a
     blondish wood that resembles pine. The sole indication of its unusual
     characteristics is a tendency to stare; though they have no eyes,
     Luggages have a peculiar ability to give one the sense that they are
     regarding you with the same attention a pin has for a butterfly. Their
     bizarre qualities make themselves clear when the Luggage begins to
     move. Stubby wooden legs, like those of a centipede, sprout from the
     base. These allow it to trot -- or, if angry, charge -- across almost
     any terrain imaginable. When in battle, Luggages have a disconcerting
     habit of licking their chops with a tongue the color of mahogany.

     These abilities stem from the material Luggages are made from: sapient
     pearwood. This plant grows in areas left unstable by magickal Effects;
     as far as can be determined, they "solidify" the reality of areas of
     their native Realm that have become too chaotic for any other form of
     life to colonize. Sapient pearwood has been likened to Primium in the
     way it can shrug off magickal interference. Sapient pearwood also has a
     primitive intelligence that prefers stable situations -- a "rootedness"
     if you will.

     This trait carries over into goods constructed of sapient pearwood.
     Curious mages who have used Mind to delve into the alien psychology of
     the Luggages have discovered that they form a close bond with their
     owners. To serve its owner is the reason for a Luggage's existence; the
     absence of the owner from its life causes a Luggage great mental
     distress. In the usual run of events this simply means that a Luggage
     will always trail on the heels of its master unless specifically
     ordered not to. This does not mean that a Luggage likes its owner,
     merely that it is supremely loyal. Luggage owners have likened the
     experience to owning a rather grumpy dog.

     The notorious reputation of Luggages stems from their fanatical
     devotion to their masters. A Luggage will follow its master to
     Hell...literally. Nothing will stop a Luggage from finding a lost
     owner. The longer it misses its owner, the angrier and more stubborn it
     will get. Anything that gets in its way -- people, Umbrood, mountains,
     continents -- with be summarily trampled over if the obstacle even
     hints at getting in the Luggage's way. Luggages have trouble with the
     concepts of "over," "under," and "around." The meaning of "through" is
     crystal-clear.

     Luggage combat is pretty forthright, involving a frontal assault that
     leaves its opponent in small pieces. They are capable of low cunning
     when the situation demands it; most Luggages simply don't go to the
     trouble. One nasty trick is their use of their vast internal volume
     to...well...eat their enemies. Opponents gulped down by a Luggage are
     never seen again. No one knows where they go -- presumably they are
     banished to a far region of the Luggage's innards. Attempts to find
     them end in failure as the Luggage innocently shows the owner's clean
     underwear instead.
