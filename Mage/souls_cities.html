   The Souls of Cities
  </h1>
  <i>
   by Anders Sandberg

  <p>
   Cities all have souls. Everything is reflected in the Three
  Umbrae; the mortal, decaying aspect in the Low Umbra, the
  spiritual, living aspect in the Middle Umbra and the essence, the
  secret soul of things, in the High Umbra. Unlike the reflections
  in the other Umbrae, the High Umbral reflection does not reflect
  the actual thing and how it currently is, (its accidence), it
  reflects the essence, the unchanging metaphysical core of the
  thing. And this reflection, or true nature, naturally affects and
  is affected by the material thing, being its soul.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cities are unusual because they are manmade, but on a scale to
  rival that of many natural features. Only nations and ideologies
  are bigger. This gives their souls tremendous power, but still
  puts them in the reach of human hands. Normally the souls do not
  change except very slowly under a very long time, or when
  powerful events change the city. But they can often be affected
  somewhat by large movements, or the activities of the
  Awakened.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is not unusual for the souls to find embodiment in
  landmarks or other things. If these landmarks are hurt, the soul
  (and the city) suffers. Typical examples are the Little Mermaid
  of Copenhagen, the EEC headquarters complex in Brussels, the
  Mosque of the Rock in Jerusalem and the Golden Gate Bridge in San
  Francisco. Many of these serve other mystical functions (the EEC
  headquarters are an hotbed for NWO, Syndicate and Tremere
  activity, the Golden Gate bridge is somehow linked to the secret
  schemes of the Craftmasons and close an circle around the Bay
  Area). Often lesser known places are influenced too, in a complex
  network over the city. The soul doesn't exist in the landmark per
  se, but is linked to it. Some mages have found that to
  communicate or perceive the soul seek out significant landmarks
  and seek it there.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some rare cities have never developed their own souls.
  Brasilia is a good example. Created entirely by the Technocracy
  to become an ideal city, they kept it completely spiritually
  blank and no soul could develop. People didn't move to the city,
  the great highways were empty and the plazas echoed with silence.
  To become alive the city needs its soul, and if its soul dies, so
  does the city.
  </p>
  <p>
   Most cities in the Old World are so old that their souls have
  become too powerful and static to change by any means; they are
  spiritual beings in their own right and independent of human
  will. Some can even defend themselves against change, like Kyoto.
  Younger cities, especially the ones in the New World, have not
  yet developed their true souls, and can be strongly affected by
  the schemes of the Awakened. During the middle ages the
  Craftsmasons were apparently seeking to focus these souls into
  the Cathedrals, in addition to their other occult uses. It is
  even possible for an Awakened to
   <i>
    become
   </i>
   the soul of the
  city, to identify himself with the soul to such an degree that
  they merge and become one. This mystical union both gives
  tremendous power and binds the soul of the city in the material
  world - if the lord of the city is defeated, killed or otherwise
  hurt, the city will suffer too. "The land and the king are
  one".
  </p>
  <p>
   The lord of a city reflects it in many ways, and gains a
  subconscious understanding and power linked to it. He will know
  if something is going on, and have an intuitive feeling for what
  to do. Influence, usually on a very subtle level, will come
  easily to him, and sometimes he can affect events just by
  existing. At the same time, he will be somewhat limited by the
  shape of the soul he represents; some courses of actions are
  simply not possible or too hard to use. Being the soul of an
  powerful city also means that the city will affect you strongly,
  giving you some of its properties.
  </p>
  <p>
   To actually become the soul of a city requires extraordinary
  means. The old soul either has to be removed/reshaped/defeated so
  that the new soul can gain ascendancy (the way of the conqueror),
  or the ambitious being has to seek out the soul, learn its
  secrets and gradually unite with it by mutual reflection and
  understanding (the way of the defender).
  </p>
  <p>
   The way of the conqueror requires a lot of temporal power,
  planning and ambition. The old core of the city has to be found
  and excised, the mystical landmarks changed or removed and a new
  city created from the skeleton of the old. This process can take
  years, but in the end the city must have changed its character to
  conform to its new lord. One example of this is Stockholm; in the
  late 60Â¹s the Technocracy demolished parts of the central
  city and replaced them with a new downtown, and outside the city
  they extended functionalistic suburbs. The new soul of the city,
  personified in the grey glass monolith at Sergel Plaza is truly
  technomantic. Of course, the Technocracy did not see this as an
  attempt to replace its "soul" (such things do not exist), instead
  it was just urban planning for the future, an attempt to create a
  new and better city (which is the same thing).
  </p>
  <p>
   The way of the defender is more subtle, and sometimes walked
  unwittingly by the Awakened. This is especially true for the
  kindred Elders, who shape their cities by their actions, thoughts
  and power for centuries, and are themselves shaped by them. The
  dreams of Methuselahs sometimes merge with the souls of the
  cities they sleep under.
  </p>
  <p>
   In some of the youngest cities, the Soul has never developed
  on its own, and instead has passed from one lord to another. One
  example is Las Vegas, where the occult rulership (closely linked
  to the powers of randomness and money) has passed down a
  succession of mobster mages. It is said that to become the new
  ruler, the old ruler has to be defeated in a mystical card
  game.
  </p>
  <p>
   In some cities the Awakened struggle against each other to
  shape the Soul of the city. In Paris, there is a struggle between
  the Sons of Ether and their allies on one side, and the
  Technocracy on the other side. The new buildings along Champs
  Elysee and especially the new triumph arc are a magickal strike
  against the power of the Eiffel tower; beside locking down the
  quintessence flows they are intended to give a new image to the
  city, something the Sons of Ether desperately opposes.

  <h2>
   Story Ideas
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Ambitions Prize
  </h3>
  A mage has arrived in town, seeking to
  become its new ruler. At first he will just study the city,
  making measurements, meditating in various places and gradually
  learning its secrets. Then he will start his secret work to
  undermine the current order of the city, play out various groups
  against each other and finally undertake a journey to the soul of
  the city to defeat it in spiritual combat as his plans come into
  fruition, plunging the city into chaos and weakening its soul it
  the critical moment. This character could appear as a background
  character during an ongoing chronicle, a mysterious manipulator
  and watcher who gradually develops into a dangerous enemy or
  ally.
  <h3>
   Metrophage
  </h3>
  A Nephandi plans to eat the city - literally.
  By weaving complex enchantments (looking like unusual vandalism)
  around landmarks and vital points in the city, she plans to force
  the soul of the city to manifest in a complex ritual, where it
  will be literally eaten by her (or rather, by her Lords through
  her). That would give her a lot of power, and dissolve the
  spiritual essence tying together the city.
  <h3>
   The Great Battle
  </h3>
  The Technocracy has decided to do some
  urban renewal, to make the city better, more static. And that of
  course means they will try to remove the old, dynamic and
  unsuitable from it, including the secluded areas where magick
  still works. The mages of the city has to fight this, in a battle
  on all levels: from construction work, urban planning to the
  battle for the soul of the city. An unexpected complication could
  be that the soul already is embodied in an old and cunning
  vampire prince.
  <h3>
   The Dark City
  </h3>
  Not all cities are humane, some demand
  sacrifices. At certain times, the city claims a victim; suddenly
  all the functions of the city like traffic, subways, elevators,
  inhabitants, weather and garbage turns against the victim,
  attacking him and draining his lifeforce into the dark soul of
  the city. The PCs could witness how this happens, or maybe one of
  them is singled out as this years sacrifice. Paranoia might be a
  survival trait when even the streets themselves are out to get
  you.
  <h3>
   The Legacy of the Craftmasons
  </h3>
  What did the Craftmasons
  really seek? And do they still exist? The Technocracy thinks they
  are defunct, except as a small, conservative group in the NWO
  working to establish control over the Masonic lodges in
  opposition to the Order of Hermes (but who cares today?). But
  maybe they still exist, and continue their secret plans? They
  designed the layout for many cities, directing their quintessence
  according to their own designs. They certainly knew about the
  power of cities, and probably used it for their own purposes. A
  group of mages may stumble upon some hints that something truly
  odd is going on.
