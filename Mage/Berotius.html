  <h1>
   The Circle of Berotius
  </h1>
  <i>
   by Anders Sandberg
  </i>
  <p>
   This artefact is a hermetic circle made out of cast iron,
  wood, silver and gold, three meters in diameter. Around its
  circumference are twelve triangular plates inscribed with the
  signs of the zodiac (and their occult correspondences) and an
  elaborate pattern of warding signs. Unlike most hermetic circles
  it is portable, the quadrants can be folded together in an
  ingenious way and the resulting small but heavy box can be moved
  to another location.
  </p>
  <p>
   What makes the Circle of Berotius unique is not its use, it
  was used by its original owner as a plain summoning circle, but
  its flaw. Making a circle portable was a very tricky problem,
  especially since hermetic dogma strictly demands unbroken lines
  and correct angles; how could they be retained if it can be
  folded together? Berotius and his craftmason companions solved it
  by a clever use of Correspondence: the joints are really
  co-located together, so that the circle is unbroken even when
  folded together.
  </p>
  <p>
   During his long life, Berotius used the circle well, but at
  the end his hubris grew and he began to deal with powers best
  left alone. Eventually fate caught up with him: he tried to
  summon the twenty seraphim of everlasting fire to destroy his
  enemies, but he angered the beings by his presumptuousness. They
  cursed him severely: he was never to leave his protective circle
  again, and never to upset the beings of the higher spheres again.
  They left, and a massive Paradox Storm wrecked Berotius chantry
  and imprisoned him in a hidden dimension inside the circle.
  </p>
  <p>
   If someone stands inside the circle when it is folded
  together, he or she will appear inside Berotius small realm which
  is hidden in the hinges and angles of the circle. It is not much
  more than a small monastic room without doors, with walls made of
  hinged metal and wood. It is furnished with a mixture of
  ceremonial implements from several ages, obscure knickknacks and
  some old books, everything covered with dust. Here Berotius lives
  together with his "familiar" Obrepo, who fetches him food and
  drink. When the circle is unfolded, the room unfolds and
  vanishes; Berotius cannot do anything to prevent this, although
  he can follow visitors to appear in the circle (visitors always
  appear back in the circle when it is unfolded, but they have to
  wait for someone on the outside to unfold it).
  </p>
  <p>
   Obrepo ("I stalk") is a bizarre creature that hides behind
  things, only revealing its appearance by shadows. Apparently it
  has a flat, reptilian head, a catlike body equipped with paws
  able to manipulate things and a long tail that fades into
  nothingness and shadow. It speaks with a soft, cunning voice in
  classic latin, preferring to discuss philosophy and magick.
  Actually, it is a paradox spirit and Berotius jailer, sent to
  torment him by always hinting of new and grandiose mysteries to
  unveil - if only he could leave the circle-realm.
  </p>
  <p>
   Berotius is old, very old, but cannot die. He is an archmage,
  but still cannot escape his fate or work magick due to the curse.
  He lives a shadow-life inside his chamber, debating with Obrepo
  and waiting for visitors. Throughout the centuries he has spoken
  with quite a few, but the seraphims' curse also subtly erases his
  name from memory. Despite having visitors, the fact that he is
  hidden inside the circle is always forgotten after a few years,
  and the circle is used for pedestrian summonings instead.
  </p>
  <p>
   Berotius would do anything to get out or die, anything. The
  trouble is that the curse is extraordinarily powerful; the only
  ones who might reverse it are the seraphim, and they are known to
  have a long memory. Obrepo loves to tell the story about one
  cabal of mages who tried to persuade the seraphim, and had their
  skeletons turned into pure gold for their trouble.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Berotius (Archmage)
  </h2>
  Appearance: Berotius is very old and
  frail, but his voice is still firm and hints at his former power.
  He has a long white hair and beard, which could be described as
  Gandalf on a bad hair day. He wears a tattered ceremonial robe,
  still hinting at golden embroideries of hermetic symbols.
  <p>
   Personality: Berotius is desperate after company, anything to
  break the tedium of debating and waiting. He will be most
  gracious to all visitors, pouring them tea and asking them about
  the outside world. What he really wants is to make them promise
  to free him. He is quite willing to act as a mentor (after all,
  he is tremendously knowledgeable in High Magick), but in exchange
  he want his students to free him.
  </p>
  <p>
   Essence: Dynamic
   <br>
    Nature: Fatalist
    <br>
     Demeanour: Pedagogue
     <br/>
    </br>
   </br>
  </p>
  <p>
   Berotius is a Master of Correspondence, Forces, Spirit and
  Prime, and Adept in Life. He has several interesting talismans
  which he might be quite willing to trade for help (usually Obrepo
  thieves them back again, making sure the helpers do not
  help).
  </p>
  <h2>
   Obrepo (Spirit 5)
  </h2>
  Obrepo is a paradox spirit although it
  has in the past been used by a few hermetic masters, something it
  deeply resents. Hence it specialises in tormenting hermetic
  mages, and in hiding the remaining tomes containing its secret
  names. Since it may not always have been a paradox being, it is
  quite possible it was once a normal spirit who began to serve
  static reality or the seraphim.
  <p>
   Appearance: Despite the hints, Obrepo doesn't look like
  anything at all. It is actually just the strange shadows and the
  unseen presence, and doesn't have a real body (so it cannot be
  found when it doesn't want to).
  </p>
  <p>
   Personality: Fiendishly clever and witty, Obrepo loves debate.
  If there is the slightest chance to start a deep philosophical
  discussion, Obrepo will take it and ruthlessly seek to drag
  everyone present into it and down into confusion. As long as
  mages argue and just think, they are harmless.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Powers
  </h3>
  Manifestation: Obrepo can freely move between all
  realities, manifesting as desired to fetch useful things and do
  small tasks. It doesn't have a physical body, and does all its
  work unseen.
  <p>
   Spirit Away: It can hide things and mages in small realms
  hidden inside the circle, separate from Berotius' realm. In fact,
  there is quite a lot hidden in there.
  </p>
  <p>
   Debate: Obrepo can never be defeated in a debate, although
  sometimes it allows its listeners to believe it has (to urge them
  into more debate). Anyone who starts to argue with Obrepo has to
  succeed with a Willpower roll against 8 to end the discussion; if
  it fails the victim will argue until Obrepo allows him to stop or
  until he becomes too tired. A botch means the victim cannot stop
  even then.
