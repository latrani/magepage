    An Ancient Call is a Mage scenario I ran during the
  summer. I have posted the highlights of that scenario in a effort
  to share my experiences with Mage. I have not included any Mage
  notes but left it in a kind of rough outline format. You will
  know what is going on but not exactly how it takes place unless
  the players made it an effort during their play. Consider
  yourselves omniscient observers of the events as they happened.
  My goal is to show how I tell a story in Mage and maybe it will
  help others as they arrange their storylines. At the end of the
  Act, I will go over the key points to help new Storytellers find
  story elements that could add to their play quality. I hope it
  helps. And of course, any feedback would be greatly appreciated,
  positive or negative.

       <br>
        Ancient man has been believed to have had visitors from another
  world visit Earth. There are many monuments and traces of
  mankinds attempts to communicate with these beings from beyond.
  But what if those communications were not in vain? What if it
  were possible to actually get an answer from those beings? Would
  anyone know what to say?

        SCENE I
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       Our story began with our players enjoying their new chantry,
  just created by their membership. This is the second such tale of
  our chantry members. Having survived the first, adventure, almost
  all of their party has elected to stay together and actively
  discover what has happened to them. They have some understanding
  of their abilities, but not enough to consider them reliable.
  They are a group of Orphans who have had their Avatars awakened
  by an Elder being who calls itself Odin. Odin awakens them and
  tells them that there is a great danger to their world and
  perhaps to Other Realms as well. Odin describes to them certain
  articles that should be found with great haste and that he cannot
  leave his home realm to assist them. He sends his son, Loki, to
  tell them what they need to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Peter, the resident occultist, recognises Loki and invokes the
  rules of hospitality, hoping that this might protect them from
  Loki and his mecurial nature. They are told that these talismans
  are required by Odin and that procuring them would go a long way
  toward repaying their debt to him for awakening their Avatars. At
  no time does Loki explain what the devices are or what they are
  to be used for. One is a Meso-American shield, several thousand
  years old, another is a large blue diamond, one of two in the
  world, and the last is a weapon of unbelievable power in the
  middle of a South American jungle. The protagonists are to simply
  find these devices and bring them to a designated pickup point
  once they have gathered them all.
      </p>
      <p class="c8">
       <span class="c7">
        SCENE II
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       The teams split up and attempted to gather the items. The
  shield was called the Eye of the Fiery Sun and was in a museum in
  New Mexico, so the heroes, Peter, who at this time was a
  burgeoning shamen spiritualist, Barton a computer
  scientist/engineer and timejockey by magick, Emily, an
  archeologist by trade, mindmage by magic, Toya, a student and
  also a mind/spirit mage and and Jon, young student, and a
  seemingly unlucky entropy mage set off on a road trip with a
  rented car. They made a stop in Reno to augment their money since
  none of them were very well set financially and needed money to
  complete the trip. Some minor gambling took place and as Toya was
  leaving with her earnings, she was assaulted by an invisible
  attacker who killed both of the hotel security guards and leaving
  her untouched. Peter, communing with nature, was approached by a
  mysterious spirit entity who threatens him and then leaves.
      </p>
      <p class="c8">
       <span class="c7">
        SCENE III
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       They continue their trip into New Mexico and eventually find
  the Museum with the Eye of the Sun there. As they are viewing the
  Eye, the museum fall under attack from a strange and powerful
  being whose powers seem to strike down ordinary mortals with his
  mere presence. More stalwart viewers are attacked by his protean
  blobs of blue tentacled death that strikes with incredible speed.
  Our heroes, opting to escape with their lives (and figuring that
  security has been compromised) break the glass where the Eye of
  the Sun is held and Bart runs with the Eye out of the building.
  The rest of the mage's fight a rear guard action.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jon is the first to fall. He reaches out with his senses and
  sees that the mage is relatively human and attempts to stop the
  entity's heart, especially after seeing how ruthless the mage is
  in his search for the Eye. Jon's attempt is partially successful
  and the alien mage, falls to his knees. Jon too, falls almost
  simutaneously as an unusual energy courses around his body. He
  grows pale and lies still. Peter, having some martial arts skills
  deflects several tentacles that were directed toward him and
  begins searching the spirit realm for some assistance. The
  entities that Peter is able to summon are simple and can only
  follow simple instructions, so Peter directs them to not allow
  anyone else to come up, by locking and keeping locked all the
  doors between the front door and this location.
      </p>
      <p>
       The two ladies, Toya and Emily attempt to simply repel the
  alien mage with a bolt of pure psychic fear. They join hands and
  concentrate on the mage. As they attempt their magic, the mage
  gestures and both ladies bolt from the room. Jon awakes after
  Peter revives him and looks up to the skylight that the mage and
  his creatures came in through. Jon wonders just how heavy one of
  the timbers would be in the skylight and watches as it comes
  tumbling down on the alien mage, pinning him to the ground. The
  alien blobs attempt to free him from the fallen debris but the
  ladies return and turn their psychic attack on the creatures who
  have no such magical defenses and are killed almost instantly.
  One creature, in its death throes, strikes out and wounds Toya
  with its razor-sharp tentacles.
      </p>

       <b>
        <span class="c7">
         SCENE IV
        </span>
       </b>
       <br>
        The alien mage remains pinned under the wreckage of the skylight
  and Emily attempts to read his mind, but only a few fragments of
  his thoughts are able to be understood. Emily helps Toya to stand
  and notices that Toya's injuries were not quite as bad as she
  thought and they attempt to probe the mind of the alien again
  before anyone comes up. Toya is successfully able to intrude on
  the entity's thoughts and as he dies, she learns much about its
  mission. The feedback from its dying, causes her to black out.
  The creature and his minions then sizzle, smoke and leave nothing
  but burn marks on the floor, and seven dead bodies in their wake
  to show that they were even here. Our protagonists leave in great
  haste.

          NOTES
         </span>
        </b>
        :
        <br>
         An Ancient Call is a multipart, multi-dimensional storyline that
  has a lot of twists, but should not be too hard to follow, once
  you know who everyone is. One thing that I did that was different
  was that all of the players, played themselves with Mage
  abilities. They wrote themselves up, as objectively as possible
  and then were give mage abilities based on their personalities
  and predilictions.
        </br>
       </p>
       <p>
        As with any good story, you need several things:
       </p>
       <p class="c8">
        A hook to get the characters interested.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this case, it was a matter of debt, performing a small
  service to pay for having their Avatars awakened. Had they opted
  out, I would have had to work harder to get them into the story,
  but I did have a backup plan. I always recommend one or two
  backups, just in case they don't bite initially.
       </p>
       <p class="c8">
        Unusual people that the players don't know and
  secrets they don't need to know (at first).
       </p>
       <p>
        In this case, the heroes were not told all they needed to know
  in order to make an informed decision about this request. Odin
  and Loki both neglect to mention the status of Asgard at this
  time, and why these artifacts are wanted. Such subplots can often
  become new stories or part of the main story later, as you will
  see in this case study.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         A chance to use their powers for their own benefit (if it
  suits the character types)
        </b>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Remember that Mages are people too, and are subject to all of
  the human frailties, greed, anger, frustration, and these things
  can make for good substories as well. As a matter of fact, human
  frailty elements and substories should be moving at the same time
  as your other storyline. (Assuming you can do this for everyone.
  If not, then focus on one person's frailty or strength per
  session.)
       </p>
       <p class="c8">
        Combat and a chance to test one's powers.
       </p>
       <p>
        This often leads to people discovering weaknesses about
  themselves and learning new ways of using ones abilities.
  Botching and failing do not have to make the story turn bad. In
  some cases, it can make the story humerous, as when Emily and
  Toya ran screaming from the mage when they botched their psychic
  fear attack. They had to run around the corner and pull
  themselves together. It was hysterically funny during the
  game.
       </p>
       <p class="c8">
        Leave clues for your players.
       </p>
       <p>
        Treat them as crumbs for them to find their way to the next
  part of your story.
       </p>
       <p class="c8">
        Create living and breathing NPCs.
       </p>
       <p>
        When you care about the NPCs, so do your players.
       </p>
       <p class="c8">
        Use less important NPC and innocents as monster
  fodder to heighten the tension in a scene
       </p>
       <p>
        Remind your players often that they are heroes (or should be)
  and they are supposed to be protecting the unawakened from the
  menaces from the fringes.
