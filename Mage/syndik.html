     Introduction by Anders Sandberg
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
     <i>
      Late this evening, while I was busy studying the Cabala, the
    doorbell suddenly rang. Hard. Outside, I found Robert Ingdahl.
    He gave me a disk, and disappeared. The following seems to be a
    description of the Syndicate, both in general and the Stockholm
    construct in special.
     </i>
     <p class="c1">
      Several things are worth noticing. One is the
    consistent use of dollar signs instead of 's'. It is not a
    random pattern, but seems to convey they "syndicatiness" of
    certain words, their intrinsic connection to the paradigm of
    the convention. The general style of writing seems to reflect
    the nature of the Syndicate; arrogant, selfish and cynical.
    Proponents of Political Correctness will probably faint.
     </p>
     <p class="c1">
      The author seems to fit the image of the typical
    syndicate member: dressed in Italian shoes and costume, with a
    red tie, new and expensive clock and sprouting capitalistic
    views. He is indeed a student at Stockholm School of Economics,
    and most of the persons he mentions as members in the Syndicate
    are really prominent citizens. Is he really a representative of
    the Syndicate, and why would he leave this information to me?
    His views seems to fit quite well, and some of the descriptions
    of Stockholm in text seems eerily true.
     </p>
     <p class="c1">
      And why would he spread this potentially damaging
    information? Does he want to defect? There are also the
    explanation from the author, that he had a secret desire to be
    a villain in peoples chronicles. A case of masochism? Or
    perhaps this is an attempt to spread subtle misinformation to
    the Traditions? Or even more spooky, perhaps the Syndicate
    doesn't even care about if it gets out...

      I carefully lit my last Cartier cigarette with my silver
  plaqued Stockholm School of Economics Zippo lighter. I took a
  look at the emblem engraved on it: the wand of Mercurius, the
  Roman god of merchants and thieves, surronded by the twin snakes
  and laure ls. I owed much to my school, the best damned business
  school in Europe, for opening my eyes to the only true pleasure
  in life: making money. When I first passed between the school's
  huge bronze doors on Sveavägen 65 I was just a scared kid
  but now after three years of hard studies I was a shrewd
  businessman, well versed in the art of doing business. AH, the
  sweet aroma of EXPENSIVE cigarettes, the aroma of success. I
  savored it and opened the huge bronze doors.
     </p>
     <p>
      It was late, I had been studying for my exam in economics and
  had not stopped until I was completely sure of passing it with
  the highest possible grade as I had done with all the other
  exams. Now I would return home to my six- room apartment on
  Östermalm and Carolina. Carolina is my girlfriend, sh e is
  from a very wealthy family and she is naturally one of my fellow
  students. I would not consider dating another kind of woman, they
  generally do not understand the importance of power and money and
  they only discuss futile subjects like world peace, e cology and
  women's liberation. At least with Carolina things are straight: I
  covet her money and she covets my great potential as a
  businessman and we do not make ourselves any stupid ideas that
  our relationship is based on romance and love or shit like t hat.
  But I must admit that she's a really good fuck for the money and
  even a stressed businessman needs some good pussy once in a while
  and good pussies are hard to buy these days if you do not know
  where to look (the Stockholm School of Economics of course). She
  got really hot when I announced to her that I would buy the
  apartment with the profit I made from my Astra shares that I sold
  when they were at their peak but our night of passion did not
  take me as high as the moment when I learned that I had ma de a
  million SEK on the deal. I grabbed a firmer grip on the handle of
  my leather briefcase and descended the stairs of the school.
     </p>
     <p>
      An old bum laid on the stairs, blocking my way. " Get out of
  my way, you parasite" I yelled at the lazy bastard and kicked him
  hard in the chest. He growled, rose up and left. I have never had
  any compassion for the creeps that live off my hard- earned
  money. I do not understand why the government keeps them living,
  feeding them with the ridiculously high taxes it steals from the
  few citizens that work for their living. At least in business the
  rules are clear: if you do not work you will go broke and get out
  of business. The business world isn't for the weak, but I am
  strong. I am a predator in the jungle and I always get my prey. I
  went to my Porsche Carrera, some may think that it is a car that
  is out of style but money and success can never go out of style.
  Yuppie isn't dead, Yuppie lives!

      I took my keys from the pocket of my new Armani suit and was
  just about to open the door when a black limousine with mirrored
  windows slid up beside me. A chauffeur in a black uniform stepped
  out and said to me " Mr. Ingdahl, I presume?". I nodded a yes. "
  Mr. Nilegård would like to speak with you" he replied and
  opened the door to the back seat of the limousine. I was stunned,
  Percy Nilegård, the famous international stock broker and
  entertainment- industry magnat would like to speak with me! It
  was a opportunity that all the graduates from the Stockholm
  School of Economics would cut off their right arm for and now it
  was offered to me, a student that still had a full year to my
  graduation from the best business school in Europe. Carolina's
  pussy could wait!
     </p>
     <p>
      I was a bit nervous as I climbed into the limousine but I hid
  my feelings completely with my charming white-teeth Italian smile
  that has many times fooled my opponents to lower their guard in
  order for me to rip their throats (financially speaking, of
  course). There he was, Percy Nilegård, a man in his
  fourties with neatly cut bl ond hair and a squared jaw. He wore
  an expensive tailor- made grey business suit and expensive
  Italian shoes. I could not fail noticing the Rolex watch on his
  wrist and his designer eyeglasses. He finished a conversation
  with someone over his Ericsson mob ile telephone and looked at
  me. We firmly shook hands and introduced ourselves and the
  limousine started driving down Sveavägen to Sergels torg
  past the imposing, but now dark, corporate headquarters.
     </p>
     <p>
      " Mr. Nilegård, I am very honoured to meet you. I must
  congratualate you on your last deal when you wrenched TV 4 out of
  the control of Jan Stenbeck ", always good to start a
  conversation with a powerful man by flattering him, I thought. "
  Oh, dear Mr. Ingdahl, that was ye$terday'$ new$, would you like
  some Chiva$ Regal?" he replied with a smile worthy of a shark.
  "On the rocks, please". " Now, lets get down to bu$ine$$. I have
  an offer to make you, Mr. Ingdahl". My tension disappered, Percy
  Nilegård was about to make me an offer, perhaps he wanted
  to recui t me to his prestigious company: Nilegård
  International Holdings with offices in Stockholm, London,
  Frankfurt, New York, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Sydney, Paris, Brussels
  and Milan. If so, a prosperous and wealthy future awaited me. "
  Very interesting, Mr. Nilegå rd, I am deepely honoured.
  What kind of an offer do you have in mind?". He lit a hand-
  rolled Havana and looked at me with a serious look in his eyes
  and said to me in a solemn voice " Mr. Ingdahl, I am offering you
  a place as a full member of the $yndica te". I was stunned, had
  he gone mad, there was no entity called the Syndicate or
  perhaps..? My curiosity got the better of me and I asked "Mr.
  Nilegård, I'm sorry but I do not understand. Would you
  please explain to me what the Syndicate is ?"

      THE HI$TORY OF THE $YNDICATE
     </h2>
     <h4>
      - Pecunia on olet!
     </h4>
     <h5>
      Emperor Vespasianus
     </h5>
     The $yndicate has always exi$ted, in
  one form or another, since the Market has always exi$ted. Once
  upon a time the Market was very restricted since its was
  restrained by the past's paradigms. World- wide trade was
  impossible, not only because of insuffic ient means of
  transportation but also because of the inadequate barter system
  favoured by the fools of the Tradition. The Traditions tried to
  focus the Sleepers' attention on spiritual and transcendental
  goals that the Sleepers could not grasp. This force d the
  Sleepers into a primitive agricultural economy where everyone was
  supposed to be self- sufficient and wary of strangers. The result
  was often starvation, low quality of life and a spiritual
  insatisfaction since most could not perceive the mysteries of the
  wizards and the priests. But our predece$$ors in ancient Rome
  found another way: the matherialistic way.
     <p>
      Matherial gratification is easily under$tandable even by the
  $leeper$ and the act of gaining matherial gratification does give
  a $pritual $en$e of accompli$hment a $en$e of meaning to this
  existence. They started to lead the Prime- flows into the
  matherial world and $trengthened thus their paradigm$ and
  suddenly trade on a large scale was po$$ible in the whole Roman
  Empire. Sure, the $yndicate was weak then, the Traditions still
  decided most of the paradigms but our predecessors had managed to
  create this hole in the system. Unfortunably, the powerstruggle
  between the Traditions destroyed the Roman Empire and Europe was
  again thrown into a dark era. But we emerged again during the
  Renaissance.
     </p>
     <p>
      The merchant houses of Medici in Florence and Fugger in
  Antwerp were largly controlled by u$ and they $tarted to rip the
  old economic system of barter and self- sufficency to pieces. As
  the kings of Europe strengthed their power they were able to gain
  peoples trust in order to make coins that were generally accepted
  by most merchant$. This enabled u$ to start bank$ in Italy which
  gave u$ even more control on the economy (and thus reality).
  People began to loose faith in God and started to covet their
  matherial needs instead and the ideal of hard work and matherial
  rewards was highly praised.
     </p>
     <p>
      On Sicily the predecessors of the Mob$ter$ evolved from
  unemployed bands of mercenaries as finally the paradigm$ had
  evolved to the extent that organized crime was profitable. Make
  no mistake, the Mob$ster$ are not that different from u$
  Bu$ine$$men. They do Bu$ine$$ too, but they have always
  $pecialized in Markets that are restricted by at first the
  Traditions and now by the New World Order so they have to u$e a
  different $trategy than u$ but that's the whole difference! In
  the dark ages crime was limited to petty things as highwaymen and
  chicken thieves but the new paradigm$ now allowed the Mob$ter$ to
  engage in more lucrative $ector$ as large- scale pro$titution,
  racketeering and $muggling. There is no clear border between our
  activities either, just look on the slave trade that were one of
  our most lucrative trade$ but now ha$ to be administrated by the
  Mob$ter$.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the 18th century the time was ripe for the foundation of
  another bu$ine$$ flow: the Economi$t$. The Economi$t$ were
  founded by Adam $mith, their task is to make the economy
  predictable and quantifiable. Soon we were able to direct the
  flow of the economy the ways that suited our end$. If economy is
  a predicatble $cience you can wield an enormou$ power since your
  are then able to decide what is profitable or not and if
  something is not profitable there is no use in doing it. The
  Market ha$ then become the sole $tandard which everything i$
  mea$ured with and we are then able to decide the course of our
  A$cention.

     </h5>
     The Economi$t$ are primarily
  concerned with the contruction of new economic model$. By these
  model$ the $yndicate is able to command the economy. The
  $yndicate can by ITSELF decide if our activities are profitable
  or not and they can use this again$t thos e who are opposed to
  u$. They $trive to make every endeavor of mankind quantifiable by
  economic $tandard$ in order to make profit the sole measure of
  $ucce$$. Economics is a powerful kind of magick but its effects
  are not clearly visible since it deals wi th the distribution of
  quinte$$ence in the economic pattern$ but when theses pattern$
  are fuelled the effect$ on world economy are clearly felt. The
  Economi$t$ are usually found at univer$itie$ and Bu$ine$$
  $chool$.

     Our Bu$ine$$ flow i$ primarily concerned with
  controlling and $upervising the flows of quinte$$ence in the
  economic pattern$ that the Economi$t$ create with their theories.
  We control the stock markets of the world and all the major
  corporation$. Our majo r task is to make the $leeper$ under$tand
  that only matherial gratification is de$irable and that they
  should live only to get the $ati$faction of working. To work
  give$ them a $en$e of belonging and a meaning to their exi$tence
  and thus they reenforce ou r view of reality and believe me, it
  is easy to make people appreciate matheriali$m since it's easy,
  quick and understandable.

     The Mob$ter$ are
  involved providing goods and services that do not directly lead
  to A$cention but are still demanded by the $leeper$ and the we
  are still not able to reduce the demand. Sure they do profit$,
  enormous profit$, but generally these goods and services do in
  the long run deviate the $leeper$ from our materialism. But if
  they u$e the Mob$ter$' drug$ and hooker$ the customer will only
  get drunk and exhausted and avoid the intoxication and orgasms
  that will get them closer to the Cult of Ecstacy's Ascension. You
  might $ay that they cover up the quinte$$ence leaks in the
  $y$tem.
     <h2>
      THE $TRUCTURE OF OUR BU$INE$$
     </h2>
     Our $tructure is strictly
  hierarchical but the ways to the top differ from bu$ine$$ flow to
  bu$ine$$ flow. The Economi$t$ start as re$earcher$ after a period
  as a$$i$tant and advance to re$earch directors. A good way to
  advance seems to be to produce u$ef ul new theorie$ that enable
  u$ to make larger profit$ by spinning new bu$ine$$ pattern$. We
  bu$ine$$men start out as MBAs after a period as trainee$ and
  advance to the title of CEO by controlling the flows of
  quinte$$ence on the Market well. The Mob$ter$ start out as brutes
  a period as $oldier$ and advance to Godfather$ when they manage
  to dominate the "illicit" Market$. Note that the names do not
  really reflect the power of the Bu$ine$$ a$$ociate. A trainee
  could be the CEO of IBM and a $oldier could be Toto Riina. I have
  heard some rumors that there is an executive board that lead$ the
  $yndicate.

       TRAITOR GEEKS! They think that they will get anywhere with
    computers and information networks but information is a
    commodity and if you want information you have to pay for it.
    We will $uffocate them soon since we control all the
    corporation$ that produce hardware and software and we are
    getting the Market to demand $tandard$. When companie$ adopt
    $tandard$ it will put a clear limit to what can be done with
    hardware and software. $uddenly, everything is not possible
    with computers since only profitable co mputer$ are worthy to
    get produced and marketed. Then we will get the petty
    bureaucrats of the New World Disorder to do our work done for
    u$ (and the fools will even do it for free!) by affirming the
    owner$' legal right$ to hi$ information through copyrig ht$.
    And finally, I just ask, who do you think own$ the phone
    company? If they wish to use its $ervice$ they will have to pay
    for them.

       It was a pity that we decided on a symposium to exclude
    these creatures from the reality since they $hare much of our
    mentality. They are bu$ine$$men even in their $ocial
    interaction$, they do not give anyone anything for free. Of
    course we do some bu$ine $$ with them, particularly with those
    companie$ controlled by the Ventrue and Giovanni clan$. They
    are ruthle$$ bu$ine$$men though they are a bit too emotional
    sometimes (all those frenzies and stuff). The Tremere are a bit
    tragic, they really should get rid of that thaumaturgical
    balony and get into bu$ine$$ since they have the nece$$ary
    organization for it. Some of them would have become excellent
    members of the $yndicate. Still, my advice to you is to $uck
    them dry at the first opportunity, financially speaking of
    course.

       These dogs are as stupid as the dreamers but they are
    certainly more violent. My old bu$ine$$ a$$ociate: Adrian
    Newberry, CEO at Pentex Corporation, has told me what a pain in
    the a$$ these lupines are. They really do believe that we
    should all go back to the stone age and that bu$ine$$ is evil.
    But they have not realized that a clean environment is a
    commodity and mu$t be bought for a price. Unfortunately they
    will dismiss this argument as "tainted by the Wyrm" and mu$t be

                       This method is very a powerful tool to introduce new
  economic pattern$ or helping already existing pattern$. By
  causing an influx of quinte$$ence into an economic pattern, its
  existence is $trengthened. It will become more real, investors
  will flock, $mart people try to conform to it and the Market
  responds favourably to it. This is usually the method new
  technologies are introduced or our corporations are kept strong.
  The method usually requires some time to work, but it is very
  efficient. To make it coincidental, the re$ponsible manipulator$
  work together to create a favourable climate, inve$t
  prime-infu$ed money and make the right per$on$ interested.
  Usually it is a good idea to take enough time to be careful,
  since an imperfection in the pattern may grow due to the influx
  of quinte$$ence.

                        Infu$e Money (Prime 2 Matter 2)
                       </h3>
                       This method is often used
  to infuse money (usually ca$h, but account$ can be infused using
  Correspondence) with quinte$$ence. They will $tore it, and slowly
  relea$e it. This will cause the money to be more real, having a
  greater impact on the market. Since the quinte$$ence leaks out
  after some time, the effect will not last many tran$actions,
  giving it a localised effect. Using Time can increase or decrease
  the delay.

                       This
  method is u$ed by the Economi$t$ or sometimes the Bu$ine$$men to
  get rid of economic patterns which are unsuitable. The Economi$t
  simply $tart to pull out the quinte$$ence of the pattern,
  dispersing it into the Market. The economic pattern will start to
  di$$olve as it become less viable. Inve$tments will stop, $mart
  people will leave the sinking ship. Normally this is easily done
  coincidental by just manipulating the market in the right way.

                       This method is very

                       This method was developed to help
  stressed Bu$ine$$men to get an edge of The Floor. It will
  accelerate the local time for the u$er, giving him the chance to
  find out what is going on, react to it and take mea$ure$ before
  anybody else.

                       This method
  is very useful. It gives the u$er a overview of the Market or a
  specific a$pect of it, like a corporation. The u$er can see the
  economic link$, the information flow$ and the feeling$ of those
  involved. This can be coincidentally done using a large
  information- retrieval $y$tem with the relevant data about the
  Market (like a computer network or a economic library with
  relevant magazines).

  they can try out important experiments in economics ther e

  progressive institute of learning that produces empathic and
  cordial businesspeople but that is just a facade, it is only
  concerned with pure, unhealthy greed.

                       The construct is commanded by the council of
  three. It is composed by the leaders of the three business flows.
  The three leaders give the other mages of the Syndicate much
  freedom of action, it is just a coordinator of the activities of
  the Syndicate in S weden but those few that do not follow the
  council's recommendations are firmly reprimanded. The amalgams
  are very loyal to each other but there is a fierce competition
  between the individual members of the amalgams.

                        THE COUNCIL OF THREE

                        Background: These three mages serve as coordinators of the

  economic models that enables the other business flows to operate
  according to the principles of the Market. It is constantly
  testing various economic models in the Horizon Realm and the
  models who se results furthers the ends of the Syndicate are made
  public and thus "real". The status of this amalgam is a bit lower
  than one might think since it was purged by some infiltrators
  from the New World Order in the 80-ies and still view upon with a
  bit of suspicion by the other amalgams.

                       <p>
                        Background: These mages supervise the legal Markets in Sweden.
  They completely control all the major corporations and financial
  institutions. They also have considerable power over the medias
  that Percy Nilegård and Jan Stenbeck have succeded in
  wrenching from the New World Order that previously had a complete
  domination in that area. They have succeded in making the
  Sleepers believe that Swedish corporations are very humane and
  friendly entities and that all business in Sweden is conducted in
  a very legal and ethical way. The real truth is that collusions,
  dirty tricks and straight out gangster methods are used every day
  in order to make a few ever growing corporations even more
  powerful.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        They have been quite successful in ruining Sweden's economy by
  raising the price levels of virtually every good through secret
  monopolies and by speculating against the Swedish currency. Their
  ultimate goal is to bring the country to the brink of desperation
  where the only possible solution will be to give the almighty
  Market free reins.

                       <p>
                        Gunilla Ahrén works on another horrific plan to turn
  all women into greedy corporate bitches that do not care about
  their families. Her organization is called "Ruter Dam" and
  corrupts women into believing that a business career is the o nly
  measure of happiness and success and that women are "bogged down"
  by their husbands and children. The women in "Ruter Dam" become
  increasingly callous and obsessed with their careers and they
  abandon their children at day- care centers where they do n ot
  get the warmth and affection that can only be given by a mother.
  The children of these callous career- pursuing women become
  convinced that a career is the most important thing in the world
  (since their mothers could abandon their own children for it) and
  they seek comfort in money and power, exactly as their parents
  do.

                       <p>
                        Background: This amalgam control the Markets made illegal by
  the New World Order such as drugs, alcohol, prostitution, weapons
  and tax evasion. The NWO did not wish to condone criminality in
  Sweden since criminality is a form of rebellion against the stat
  e ( as the "criminals" don't give a damn about obeying the
  state). To resolve this problem it has often collaborated with
  the NWO not opposing it when it made some markets illegal and
  this has been a very successful tactic since the underworld then
  gained total monopoly on some very lucrative markets. The Mob
  even condones the NWO's "war on drugs". The government has
  cathegorically declared all recreational substancies as evil and
  utterly distructive to the users. The users are then forced to
  buy them fro m the Mob and since all persons involved in drug
  deals (even the buyers) are declared to be to most vile and
  horrible of criminals, the Mob's influence increases for every
  young person that wants to try a puff on a joint.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        The Mob has even bribed some policemen and members of the
  parlament to start a campaign against all forms of pornography
  and to declare it as demeaning to women and dangerous since it
  always incites a wish to commit rape in the reader. The reason
  for this campaign is that Sweden earlier had very liberal laws
  concerning pornography and anybody could produce it and its
  immense profits passed the Mob by. Now the Mob can gain a
  monopoly by being the only supplier of pornography.

                       </h2>
                       All the four nodes of the construct are situated on
  the HUGE Sveavägen avenue on a single ley line. The first is
  the immense Scandinavian Airline Systems (SAS) Corporate
  Headquarter that is placed upon a captured Get of Fenris caern at
  Frösunda. The secon dis the Wenner- Gren Business Center sky
  scraper at the beginning of Sveavägen. The third is the
  Stockholm School of Economics proper and the last one is the
  Öhrström glass- pillar at the end of Sveavägen.
  The glass- pillar is a monstrous piece of art th at steals the
  life- blood quintessence of the city of Stockholm. The nodes
  capture a great deal of the quintessence produced in Stockholm
  and puts it in the greedy hands of the Syndicate leaving
  Stockholm a grey, dismal and lifeless place were people beco me
  dull, grey and only caring about their work. This fits the
  Syndicate fine since it needs callous persons without imagination
  that do not give a damn about each other as workers in the
  Syndicate's corporations.

                       It is quite unusal for Syndicate
  Command Centres to have a horizon realm but the Stockholm School
  of Economics obtained one by pouring quintessence from its
  powerful nodes into a chimarae created by Josafat F. Alidon, a
  callous and calculating American businessman in order to have a
  testing facility for the experiments of the Economic$. The
  construct's season is summer. The realm seems like city from the
  21 century but it is very grey and dismal
                       <h3>
                        Environment
                       </h3>
                       The realm seems like a metropolis of the 21
  century. In its center, enormous black corporate skyscrapers
  surmounts the habitation blocks of the poor. The skyscrapers are
  in peak condition and all the Syndicate mages that visit the
  realm live and stay with in the perimeters of the corporate area.
  The highest and most magnificent of the skyscrapers is that of
  the Alidon &amp; Muur Corporation. Outside the heavily guarded
  walls of the corporate center the habitation blocks of the poor
  stretch in every direction. The streets here are dark and
  brooding. The poor work almost as slaves in huge well- guarded
  factories that pollute the air with all kinds of toxins.
  Criminality is rampant in the desperate masses and the Mob can
  try out new kinds of drugs, organizations and techniques here
  without fearing of destabilizing the real Market and without a
  police force disturbing them. Corporate helicopters fly through
  the smoke- filled skies and heavily armed corporate gunships are
  always ready to without mercy put down any rebellion among the
  poor. In the corporate center the Bu$ine$$men can fine tune their
  financial warfare abilities in "mock corporate wars" and learn
  how to best make use of monopolies. The Economi$t$ can observe
  the response of the realm's society on the various constantly
  changing "laws of economy" and then apply the best results to the
  real world. The Syndicate's dream is to expand this reality to
  Stockholm proper.

                       The denizens of the realm are apart
  of the Syndicate mages and their acolytes products of Josafat F.
  Alidon's perverted dreams of power and wealth. They have been
  made more "real" by the enormous amounts of quintessence that the
  Syndicate has stolen from Stockholm. They are underfed, desperate
  and often violent. They are driven by an unnatural greed but are
  generally very afraid of the powerful corporations and the seedy
  Mob. Most of them work in the factories but many make their
  living by selling drugs, s elling their bodies and robbing others
  of their possessions (even the corporations' property is stolen
  but the Syndicate likes this since it gives them a testing ground
  for new inhuman security systems). They live in a virtual hell of
  poverty and despair and the air is nearly unbreathable by the
  pollution. The realm's sun is considered by most to be a legend
  since it is always covered by smoke.

                       The

  Inside there are personal quarters with all kinds of luxuries

                        The Stockholm School of Economics
                       </h3>
                       This is the actual
  construct. The SSE is Sweden's most prestigious business school
  well on the pair of Harvard, Bocconi and others. The admission
  requirements are enormous and only the elite is admitted. The
  students are then required to perform study res ults of an
  inhumanly high level or else they are kicked out. The objective
  is to force all the students to value their studies more than
  anything else and to completely submit to the Syndicate's
  propaganda about the nature of the world.
                       <p>
                        After a few months most students have become callous busy-
  bodies that are enforcing a cut- throat competition among
  themselves and are only interested in gaining money and power at
  all costs. The most successful are often selected as acolytes of
  the Syndicate. After theirgraduation these Masters of Business
  Attrocities are thrown into the corporate world where they
  quickly gain positions of great power and influence. They learn
  that they must always keep up a friendly and humane facade to
  others and they generally make a very good impression on most
  people but if someone gets to know them better their true nature
  of greed and corruption will emerge.

                        The school is an fine large building built in 1924 and it is
  guarded by a state of the art security system and many security
  guards in civilian clothes. It is worth noting that the SSE's
  computer system is not plugged into the Net. Headmaster Staffan
  Bure nstam- Linder greatly fears Virtual Adept infiltration.

                       Here the downside of the realm emerges.
  Sergel's square is a large square in the middle of Stockholm and
  here the Mob can perform its activities in the open since the
  police always looks the other way to the most important
  operations. It is almost a Stock holm School of Crime since most
  young criminals from the impoverished suburbs of Stockholm gather
  here. The most callous and devious elements of these are put
  through a series of tests (escaping the police, killing someone
  for the Syndicate, managing a dr ug deal and so on) and those
  that survive might become acolytes or even Mob$ter$. The whole
  square almost reeks with moral filth, corruption and insatiable
  greed.

                        HISTORY
                       </h2>
                       The Construct was started in 1909 at a different
  site. In 1924 it moved to its present site in order to steal the
  quintessence of the Sveavägen ley line. It has been quite
  successful in doing so and it has accumulated much power and
  resources. In 1988 the chimarae of Josafat F. Alidon was
  discovered by coincidence and the American was invited to join
  the Syndicate. Since then the constructs power has risen
  astronomically and it decided to wrench the control of Sweden's
  reality from the New World Order. The struggle is far from over
  but the construct is certain that their secret, unofficial war
  will succeed.

                       On the surface it maintains good
  relations with all the other conventions in Stockholm but it is
  secretly waging a war against the NWO to usurp its power. Its
  enormous supply of quintessence gives it much power over the
  others.

                       All Syndicate mages are always
  welcome but mages from other conventions must obtain permits to
  visit the realm. The realm uses Rogues on a regular basis but the
  Syndicate keeps a watchful eye on them.

                       Two other Syndicate Command Centres
  are allied with the Stockholm Construct. It has many enemies,
  especially in the Traditions but most are too weak to pose a
  serious threat.

                       Excellent, especially in studies in
  the Sphere of Prime. The mundane library is Scandinavia's finest
  and largest in business and economics. Many fine tutors can be
  found but tuition is only given to the most ambitious of students
  since it requires an enor mous dedication.

                        STORY IDEAS
                       </h2>
                       The dominant theme is how greed and ambition
  can pervert people. The atmosphere is brooding since these
  talented and skillful members of the elite of Swedish society are
  trying to make themselves more powerful and rich on the expenses
  of the masses that p ut their trust in them. It should show the
  players how meaningless the existence in the Technocracy's
  perverted utopia actually is as they see that everyone is
  searching for meaningless matherial gratification and not trying
  to reach true happiness and sa tisfaction.
