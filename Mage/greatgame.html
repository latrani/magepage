   The Great Conspiracy
  </h1>

  <p>
   Say the word "Conspiracy" to anyone "in the know" in the
  WWorld of Darkness, and yuo're likely to get the response "SO
  what else is new? Which illuminated group is at it this week?"
  All in all, it can get rather humdrum after a time.
  </p>
  <p>
   But what if, instead of there being hundreds of unrelated
  little copnspiracies, there were really only a few grand ones
  that transcended even the makers of the so-called grand
  conspiracies, forming a Great Conspiracy.
  </p>
  <p>
   The beings that run such conspiracies cannot possibly be
  comprehended by mere mortals, since they contemplate forces so
  vast that they transcend even the knowledge and experience of the
  Oracles of the magi and the Antediluvians of the Kindred.
  </p>
  <p>
   WHat if, indeed, there were three different Great Conspiracies
  going on at the backdrop, each with their own major players?
  Here's an overview to this backdrop that may provide that
  unifying influence that can give meaning to anotherwise confused
  tangle of conspiracies within conspiracies that fill the World of
  Darkness (and can answer such annoying questions as the
  relationship between the Giovanni and the Euthanatos, or PenteX
  and the $yndicate.)
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Great Conspiracies
  </h2>
  The Tellurian has always existed,
  yet it didn't exist until the first great beings set eyes upon a
  shapeless, formless, unpatterned chunk of not-void that
  eventually became the Gaian Tellurian. Since it was not-void, it
  had everything within it, including a native intelligence, but it
  was patternable by Great Beings from outside.
  <p>
   These Great Beings played with this new Tellurian, even
  inviting it in on the whole thing. And they began a series of
  conflicts and games, with the stakes being totally unfathomable
  to all but the most twisted and insane individuals, who are also
  the most Transcended. There are three main versions of this game
  that drive the entirety of the World of Darknes and its
  surrounding Tellurian.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Great Reunification
  </h2>
  The players in this game wish
  only one thing: To re-establish the unity of the single power.
  But each wants to be the one in control. The players in this game
  are no lesser than Caine's Sire, the One of the Celestial Chorus,
  the Outer Lord of Order, the Crystal Essence, and the Eater of
  Worlds.
  <p>
   Each of these powers has their own method of seeking out their
  goal, and all are in a race to see who can eventually recombine
  the entire essence of the Tellurian into a single thing (for lack
  of a better word, for it is not merely a place, n entity, or an
  object, but all of these). The major players in this conspiracy
  are:
  </p>
  <div class="c1">
   <b>
    Caine's Sire
   </b>
   - The prototype of all Vampires, this being
    created not only Caine, but the Consumption Wyrm of the Garou.
    It seeks to create its perfect unity through consumption and
    forced conjoining.
   <p>
    <b>
     The One
    </b>
    - We are all part of the One, the Celestial
    Chorus tells us. Our Avatars are shards of the Primal Essence.
    Our eventual goal is to reunify these shards back into the
    original being, the One. This is the philosophy this being
    proposes, and instills in its followers and tools.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     The Outer Lord of Order
    </b>
    - A strange being which
    exists in all times, all spaces, and contains every pattern
    known and unknown. Oddly, this being is itself a paradox,
    because it also contains the patterns of randomness and chaos.
    It's tools are less direct, save that its actions have
    contributed to the "madness" of the Weaver in Garou mythology,
    and the strengthening of the Gauntlet.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     The Crystal Essence
    </b>
    - This is yet another strange
    being, containing all concepts. The differnce between it and
    the Outer Lord of Order are unfathomable, but it is known that
    they often work at cross-purposes. This being seems more
    interested in causing enough beings to interact in so many
    different ways that eventually they will find the points where
    they lock together, helping rediscover the original order and
    unity.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     The Eater of Worlds
    </b>
    - Every game has its spoilsport,
    and this one is no exception. The Eater of Worlds wants to win
    - by being the only player left standing. It has already made
    it so that none of the other players can win unless they
    destroy/assimilate it, which would taint the win condition
    since it is not one of the original game pieces.
   </p>
  </div>
  Caveats to the Game: The various players of this game have
  an interesting problem that none have yet realized fully, save
  maybe the Crystal Essence and the Outer Lord of Order - to win
  the game, one must become a piece within it. The players are also
  pawns, and the game is very self-referential.
  <h2>
   The Infinite Democracy
  </h2>
  An interesting game in and of
  itself, the players of this Game do nothing, in a very strict
  sense. But they tend to work with incredible skill and adeptness.
  <p>
   THe premise of the game is much like the Game of Rules
  (sometimes called Dictator, Fascist, Democracy or
   <a href="http://funnelweb.utcc.utk.edu/~chatham/nomicfaq.html">
    Nomic
   </a>
   when played by mortals as a party game). In a very simplified
  game, the first player makes a rule about the game. Only three
  rules apply:
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    You cannot directly contradict an established rule
   </li>
   <li>
    You cannot make a rule that removes another player from the
    game
   </li>
   <li>
    Any player can unmake a rule (veto), but must have a
    majority of the other players in agreement, and all have a
    voice. This rule as well cant be changed.
   </li>
  </ol>
  The goal of this game is deceptively simple: You win if you
  create the "final rule", and make it so that no more rules can be
  made that do not meet the criterion of the three main rules.
  <p>
   The players of this game are almost impossible to fathom, but
  as they create more and more rules, the scale of each rule
  shortens, until they begin making rules about individuals and
  small groups of certain species. There is truly no bound to this
  Game, but the interplay can be incredible.
  </p>
  <div class="c1">
   <b>
    The Gödel Entity
   </b>
   - seeks to undermine all rules by
    using the loopholes that exist, and at the same time limits the
    game by making many rules impossible to modify without
    contradiction. A bit like tying together a string by making a
    convoluted knot, sooner or latter it will be impossible for the
    string to move since it blocks itself.
   <p>
    <b>
     The Unifier System
    </b>
    - the main enemy of the Gödel
    Entity, seeks to create a rule that subsumes all other rules, a
    Final Rule that implies all possible rules. Since an early rule
    says that new rules have to be different from previous rules,
    the Final Rule would be the winning rule.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     The Infinite Descent
    </b>
    - this entity tries to force
    every other player into its own game, where they
    <i>
     have
    </i>
    to
    make certain moves (like in Tic-Tac-Toe, where you have to do
    certain moves or the opponent will win). The Infinite Descent
    hopes to retain enough freedom to win.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     The System Jumper
    </b>
    - this trickster entity tries to
    win by making the other entities defeat each other. It is
    always adding unexpected rules making it hard for the Unifier
    System and Infinite Descent to get ahead, but also adds more
    freedom to the system so that the Gödel Entity cannot win.
    Sometimes the System Jumper becomes more players or changes the
    game.
   </p>
  </div>
  <h2>
   The Great Game of Life
  </h2>
  Everyone has seen the Game of
  Life, the computer algorithm that generates a number of "flowers"
  that are born, grow, stabilize, decay, and die based on a number
  of simple rules. In this Great Conspiracy, the players are
  manipulating the basics of the Game of Life, tweaking with the
  scenarios that are played out - but the only way they can do this
  is by changing each and every piece in the game through some kind
  of agent, which also becomes a piece in the game. Powers such as
  Gaia are both players and pieces in this Great Game.
  <p>
   In this game there are no real rules except for the rules of
  the game (which has been defined by the Infinite Democracy), but
  there are two sides of players: the Enders and Eternalists. The
  Enders seek to end the game, by making it impossible for any new
  change (for example, if all pieces were to be destroyed or the
  entire configuration became static) or to lock it into a loop,
  while the Eternalists try to make the game continue forever.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some players are:
  </p>
  <div class="c1">
   <b>
    The Replicator
   </b>
   - an Eternalist trying to bring more and
    more pieces and agents into the game so that it becomes harder
    for the Enders to stop it. Works through all forces of
    creation, growth and complexity.
   <p>
    <b>
     The Patterner
    </b>
    - an Ender trying to create a stable
    pattern that can fill all reality. Previously it has tried to
    lead configurations towards a stable state, but it was too easy
    for the Replicator or Random to prevent it. Instead it has
    subverted the idea of replication, and tries to create
    self-replicating, error-correcting patterns that will spread
    everywhere and become resistant to change. Behind all forces of
    order, pattern, life and direction.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     The Random
    </b>
    - an Eternalist trying to keep the game
    running by acting unpredictable, preventing
    <i>
     all
    </i>
    plans
    from working perfectly. Behind everything unpredictable, random
    and all tricksters.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Meta
    </b>
    - an Eternalist
    <i>
     or
    </i>
    Ender who seeks to use
    the plans of the Replicator and Pattener against them. As soon
    as a new piece appears or the Patterner manages to overrun
    reality, Meta introduces a small change that causes a new level
    of reality to appear. It is uncertain if Meta seeks to continue
    the game forever by building on top of all levels, or if the
    goal is to create a super-pattern that is its own metalevel.
    Its agents are all forces of self-organization, energy and
    intelligence.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     The Wrecker
    </b>
    - an Ender with a simple strategy: try to
    wreck the other player's agents so that it will be the last
    player able to influence the game. Then it will destroy every
    pattern. Its agents are the forces of destruction, nihilism,
    chaos and limitations.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     The Independent
    </b>
    - this entity works closely with the
    Wrecker in sabotaging the pieces of others, but is an
    Eternalist. The Independent seeks to destroy the ability for
    <i>
     all
    </i>
    players (including itself) to affect the game - the
    game is to decide its own fate. Its agents are for all
    practical purposes indistinguishable from the agents of the
    Wrecker.
   </p>

   Sorry I got less detailed as time went on... Only the first one
  lent iself very well to a description of the various players, but
  can definitely be used as a guideline for fleshing out the ideas.
  Now, imagine a universe where all three games were going on at
  once... Frightening concept, but definitely within the realm of
  possibility. Pieces behave erratically, because there are other
  players, and players themselves are manipulted as pieces through
  a series of metarules that cannot possibly be understood.
   <p>
    The Great Conspiracies are games in which the rules of the
  game are merely pieces within the game itself - they become truly
  self-referential.

    My thanks to whoever posted the
    <a href="Mage/game_oracles.txt">
     piece about the two Oracles playing the Game...
    </a>
    It was an
  enlightening piece, to say the least.

  posts.
