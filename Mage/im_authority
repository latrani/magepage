NWO Rote - "I Am in Authority Here!"

Mind 2 (diff 5, coincidental - roll arete)

This rote adds automatic successes gained on the arete roll to any
intimidation and/or leadership rolls. People simply do not question a
impressive enough authority figure. This rote makes the caster seem to be
the epitomy of lawful authority and not to be questioned. If  successes
equal a victims willpower are scored on a combined arete + cha/man +
leadership/intimidation, then that individual must spend a point of
willpower to attack or directly contravene the "proper authority".
