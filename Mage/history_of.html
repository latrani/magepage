      There has been much speculation of the history of the 10
  Traditions, especially in the light of the obscuring tactics of
  the Technocracy and their somewhat successful campaign to rewrite
  history. But from the information we have on hand, we have been
  able to develop some measure of what happened, relatively
  unobscured by Technocratic meddling.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is one disturbing thing to note, however. Many powerful
  spirits were reluctant to talk of the time before approximately
  20,000 BC, giving a hint that the world was a much, much
  different place then. I will pursue this line sometime in the
  future.
     </p>
     <h2>
      Hunter-Gatherers, Fertility, and Magic
     </h2>
     Magic at the very
  beginning time, before the rise of civilization in Katal Huyuk,
  Sumeria, China, India, and South America, most peoples were
  primitive hunter-gatherers, with little time to devote to
  spiritual matters, as they were busy trying to survive in a world
  that it seems was not cooperating with their survival. The
  Technocracy paints this period as just past the last great Ice
  Age, though whether such an event occurred we cannot be sure.
     <p>
      What we do know is that somewhere along the line, people began
  learning the most basic of the Arts, those things that were
  centered upon the self, and survival. Healing magics, enhancing
  the body, speaking with the spirits of the predator and prey,
  these were things that concerned these early people. And this is
  where Magic, both the magic of the Traditions and the magic of
  the hedge wizards and the Arcanum, began to develop.
     </p>
     <p>
      The oldest magics were of the simple detection level, though
  apparently from folklore there were some who were highly skilled
  in the paths of thee Spirit of and Life. These people were
  virtually demigods among their own people. These old shamans and
  witch doctors were probably the first Dreamspeakers and
  Verbena.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is interesting to note that amongst the most primitive
  cultures, there is no knowledge of the role of sexuality or of
  the male in reproduction. Thus, women tended to hold a level of
  mystique, and thus more commonly ones to develop the Arts, then
  the man, because it was thought that only the woman could bring
  new life into the world. This may explain a matriarchal focus in
  the oldest paths of the Arts, particularly the Verbena.
     </p>
     <p>
      The other subset of individuals were the first artificers,
  those that created the tools and artifacts that archaeologists
  deal with today. They were shapers of form, of matter, and were
  quite likely the progenitors of the Technologic Mages, the Sons
  of Ether and the Technocracy.
     </p>
     <p>
      As the hunter-gatherers settled down, they began using more
  elaborate techniques to enhance the plants they gathered, and the
  herd they hunted. Somewhere along the line, this crossed the line
  from hunting and gathering to domestication and agriculture. With
  these developments, the first of the city-states could arise.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is useful to note that the Garou Impergium kept the peoples
  of the world in check much further than the first moment they
  could have developed cities. Thus you have the relative explosion
  of cities at the end of the Impergium, approximately 8,000 years
  ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are a few mysteries left, however. Stonehenge, the
  Sphinx, and the megaliths of the world. Who built them? Many of
  them are beyond the ken of the Garou, who were possibly the
  dominant power of the world until they let the Impergium go.
  Mortal society was discouraged from this practice, and the
  Kindred were most likely so few in number that they could not
  have masterminded such an endeavor, nor would they have been
  interested. It is something to explore.
     </p>
     <h2>
      The Beginnings of Civilization, and the Rise of the City
  State
     </h2>
     Once towns and cities began to arise, the character of
  the people changed dramatically. People had more time to devote
  to the spiritual, to the non-immediate. And out of this came
  three major developments.
     <p>
      First of these was the development of ritual. People began
  recording what they were doing, and they would teach this to
  others by rote, giving them exact steps. This method was applied
  to everything, both material and spiritual. This is quite likely
  where the Order of Hermes got its start.
     </p>
     <p>
      Secondly was the development of religion, and with it the
  complex mythical cycle that was associated with it. This was the
  realm of the Celestial Chorus, the Euthanatos, and to a lesser
  extent in the West, the Akashic Brotherhood. With more time to
  devote to the spirit, these areas became more important, and
  those that wielded the mostly incomprehensible powers of the
  spiritual world became the rulers. Thus came the era of the rule
  of priest-kings and priestess-queens.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lastly, but most importantly, came the development of
  architecture, and directed labor. No longer were people working
  as individuals, but rather in teams. People were creating surplus
  goods, which caused money and trade to be developed. To
  accomplish this, the artificers of old became master architects,
  and they created the concepts of time and position as regulators
  of the world. This is the basis of the Ahl'I'Batin, the "missing"
  Tradition.
     </p>
     <p>
      It was back during this time that the effects of certain
  stimuli heightened spiritual sensation. Thus came the discovery
  and use of hallucinogens, intercourse, and other intense
  experiences to enhance spiritual experience. This somewhat
  secretive group became the seeds of what would eventually become
  the Cult of Ecstasy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many wonder at the role the Euthanatos played in the earliest
  religions, but the answer is quite simple. The year was governed
  by a cycle of life, death, and rebirth, a tenet at the core of
  the Euthanatos philosophy. When something has outlived its time,
  it must pass on, to become something useful. THus we see the
  "young god" myths in almost every world culture. Baldur of the
  Norse, Osiris of the Egyptians, Persephone of the Greeks, and
  even in the Christ figure of the Christians, these are all
  examples of the "lesson" of death, that some things must pass
  beyond before returning. This philosophy lies at the heart of the
  modern Euthanatos.
     </p>
     <p>
      If one studies well the history of this time, one can see
  traditions that carried through to modern times, and the seeds of
  what became, in the modern age, the 10 Traditions. But for now,
  our research into the past continues, into the nature of the
  megaliths, and that time the Technocracy calls the Ice Age.
