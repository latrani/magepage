     "This game is not real...you are"
          -introduction from Nephilim: RPG

     Since you are reading this (and assuming you're not one of
those people who reads the last page of Mystery novels) I guess
you've at least skimmed through my work.  For this I'm very
grateful.  Its been a few months since I started this supplement
and I'm more than happy with the result.  Its not the typical
Secret Society dissertation I had originally had planned, but I
feel that it has blossomed into something more original.  I hope
you like what you've read, or at least have something that you
can use.
     Again, I'd like the thank Anders Sandberg for all his ideas
and information, Carl Gutbrod for his support, and all the
members of wod-l for their suggestions and ideas that have
floated about since its inception.

                            SUGGESTED MATERIALS

     The following are excellent sources of Illuminati and Secret
Society information in general.

     X-Files (Fox TV-Show)
          -excellent example of the Enigmatic Stratagem at work

     Mission: Impossible (Both Syndicated TV-Shows)
          -excellent guide to Cadre/Clique operations

     Nephilim: Occult Roleplaying (Chaosium)
          -has great secret societies (perfect for Throngs)

     Call of Cthulhu (Chaosium) 
          -great source of secret cults and things "man was never 
            meant to know".

     Illuminati Card Game/GURPS Supplement (S. Jackson Games)
          -Original motivation for this supplement, this was my   
            first foray into the world of the secret societies. 

     GURPS Voodoo: The Shadow War (Steve Jackson Games)
          -More nifty secret societies (on the supernatural side) 
           as well as a fascinating GothPunk-style setting.

     GURPS Cthulhupunk (Steve Jackson Games)
          -Cyberpunk meets Cthulhu.  'Nuff said.
     
     "In the Country of the Blind" (Michael Flynn). 
         -Very relevant to this game! It is about conspiracies    
          using mathematical models to predict the probable       
          future; the conspiracies wage a shadow war against each 
          other, both trying to hide and trying to wipe each      
          other out. Has several neat descriptions of a basilica, 
          Pawns, Rooks, Knights, Bishops and a Queen.  
          
     "Focault's Pendulum" (Umberto Eco). 
         -Lots of material about conspiracies,  especially the    
          Templars. 

     Society Net.post (Mark Carlson, found in ftp.iquest.com
                       in /pub/RPG/Misc)
          -though low on facts, this gives you great ideas on the 
            structures of fictional secret societies and the sub- 
            societies below them.  Scary thing is, his ranking    
            system for agents is very close to mine (and I        
            down-loaded it two months AFTER deciding on the       
            Ranks in this supplement...).  Based on Call of       
            Cthulhu and Comic sources, as well as real            
            conspiracies.

THE LAST NOTE (HONEST):  If enough people like this work, I will
support it with posts over the next month.  Ideas floating
around in my head are stats for Corvus Beltaine (and more info on
the Shamans of Beltane), the Grey "Aliens" (and an expanded
psychic generation system and power selection), an expanded
version of Hunters Hunted (with more Merits/Flaws and
Backgrounds unique to mankind), and more information on the
Secret Society of the Wraiths:  The Sihouette.

    That's it.  Read and give me feedback, flames, suggestions, 
problems and questions.  Don't let my initial oversensitivity deter 
you, I want feedback (but I want you to read it first before 
complaints).  An as far as my unwillingness to change, I will only 
not change the clan system and the politics.  Why?  I'm confortable 
with the Clans structure and have no ideas on how to remove that (and 
frankly I like having different secret socieities battle it out).  As 
for politics, its not just the Vampires domain.  Anyway if there are 
no politics in Illuminati, what's the point of having it?  As far as 
cadres, courts, and other "vampire-esque" trappings, tell me what you 
like and don't like.  An remember, scrap what you want!  I won't be 
offended (honest).
