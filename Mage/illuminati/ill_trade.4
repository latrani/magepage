                     Chapter Four:  Rules of the Trade

                       a) A Guide to the Society Web

     The Societies must be very careful when dealing with the
World of Darkness.  There are many forces which, due to their
fantastic powers, are more likely than mundanes to find out about
the Illuminati.  Therefore, the Societies have developed several
techniques to safeguard their secrecy.  
     Note:  Take these suggestions as a general guideposts.  Use,
modify, or ignore them at your leisure.


THE WEB
     To first understand the Society influence structure, you
must understand the Web.   The Society is like a spider, its
trail of money and influence like its web.  The Societies go from
organization to organization, using influence and other means to
convert them into their holdings.   Each holding is a spring-
board to acquire several other organizations.   Those
organizations would each take control of a couple of holdings,
and so on.  Covert and visible influence, compounded with false
trails, shell coporporations and ligitimate revenue make tracing
an Illuminati to its source a long, arduous process.  That is, if
they even have the Contacts and Resources to undertake such
large-scale investigation.
     At the centre of the web is the prime holding of the
Society, probably some multinational or other powerful
organization.  This organization has a few, easily-broken links
connect itself to the Basilica.  If, by some means, the Society
is tracked to that organization, the Basilica breaks the links
and that organization takes the blame.  Like the spider, the
Illuminati control the web, but are not part of it.  Storytellers
should pick a Prime Holding that has some prior history of
criminal or espionage activity.  It should be easier for players
(and their characters to blame the organization than a hidden
conspiracy.     
     For example: Say your studious players track the Keepers of
Secrets to its Prime Holding.  Have that holding be something
like the CIA or NSA.  Who wouldn't suspect the CIA of being
behind the infiltration?  Who would suspect a HUMAN conspiracy
behind it?  If anything, the players will be blame the Vampires
or the Technocracy (excellent scapegoats).  Of course, the
Keepers are more than happy to leave evidence to prove the
character's hypothesis...

SHUFFLING
     To operate effectively, the Societies need to support their
troops with money.  Orders can be given easily, but cash often
presents a problem.  The major weakness of the Web is that it has
the potential of leaving a paper trail right to the Society's
Prime Holding.  To fight this, the Conspiracies practise called
"shuffling".  That is, the use of small diverse holdings called
Junctions to transfer the money between holdings.  Junctions may
cross the spheres of control that each other has set up.  A
Keeper of Secrets might use an insignificant Televangelist,
something that you would think only the Pantheon would bother
with, as a Junction.  Since Junctions generally have no major
influence in the world, they are not considered valuable property
and are basically fair game.  There may be as many as a half-
dozen Junctions, or more between Holdings.  As the money flows
through the Junction it is lost in a maze of transactions which
make a paper trail literally a nightmare to follow.  Though
wasteful money-wise (each Junction takes a small cut to keep
going), but it further prevents the likely hood of curious
individuals for following the trail of money right to its source. 

               b) How to Betray Friends and Influence People      
               (The Storyteller's Guide to Acquisitions) 

ACQUISITION
     Though this has come to mean any takeover of an
organization, its original meaning was the appropriation of an
unheld organization or one held by those not of the Illuminati
(mainly the Supernaturals).  Because the risks or discovery are
greater than normal, all Acquisitions MUST by handled as a
Challenge of Dominion (see below).  Though Hostile Acquisitions
(Takeovers) have been done, the Court rarely lets the
perpetrators go unpunished.

THE CHALLENGE OF DOMINION
     The Challenge is the official name for the taking over of
another's Society's Holding.  Unlike what it may infer, there is
no official declaration of the Society's intent.  What it does
mean is that the Challenge is a test of the cunning and power
between the two Illuminati.  However, there are some strict rules
of conduct in a standard Challenge.  These are outlined in the
Pax Concordat section of Chapter Two:  No Violence is allowed and
when one Society conclusively controls the decision making of the
Holding (say by controlling the majority of stocks or
brainwashing the President), then the Society takes control of
that property.
     Non-Violent means that only persuasive methods may be used. 
The most common avenues is Brainwashing, Blackmail (a good short
term measure), or subversion (say by taking over the
Vice-President and then orchestrating his rise to the
Presidency). After the Challenge has been one, the Rook assigned
to that Holding then goes to work.  He then brainwashes key
personnel to make sure most of the leadership's support is also
loyal to the society.  These support people are often the first
"casualties" of any takeover attempt (often literally if a
Hostile Takeover is initiated).
     Challenges of Dominions can be a great source of roleplaying
potential for Illuminati Players.  Knights and Pawns would have
to actually think and role-play instead of shoot, maim and kill. 
A well-thought out plan of action, along with some quick-thinking
(and blind luck) will be required to outsmart the enemy Clique.   

HOSTILE TAKEOVERS
     When a Challenge of Dominion gets violent, then its called a
Hostile Takeover.  Gangland-style executions and daring raids
that would make Sly Stalone proud are common elements in these
takeover attempts.  While this sort of acquisition may satisfy
the "Brujah-style" players in your group, it is very unwise to
allow this sort of action continue without consequences.  Though
one such action by a Clique/Cadre doesn't concern the Court,
multiple instances will only tempt their wrath.  Warnings are
rare with the Court, and giving one to the players should be
conveyed with as much venom and anger as possible.  The next
violation will surely get one of the player's killed...as an
example.  Don't be afraid to terminate a Knight or Pawn because
of his actions.  Your player's should actually _fear_ the Court,
as much or more than a Vampire would fear a Prince or Justicar. 
The Court IS the Society's law.  Not only will he enforce the
boundaries of your campaign but when they _have_ to go against
the Court, it will make the adventure all the more terrifying,
exciting and satisfying ("We cheated the almighty Court! 
Yes!!!!!!"). 

                           c) Phantom Veneer 
           (And How To Repair The Damage When They Break It)  
                                    
   As I have stressed throughout this supplement, secrecy is the
only advantage the Illuminati have.  All Supernaturals have some
information on each other. The Vampires know about the Lupines,
Mages, Wraiths, etc.  However, no one knows about the Societies,
at least nothing that counts has hard fact.  Anxious Illuminati
Players, with their zealous dreams of world domination are
sometime prone to do open and spectacular things.  Open warfare,
assassinations, and heavy-handed tactics might well suit a
Werewolf campaign, but are extremely dangerous in Illuminati: The
Conspiracy. Yes, some groups due use Hostile Takeovers more than
not (the Global Elite is notorious for this), even they pick and
choose targets are pre-disposed to violence.  For example:  The
city's largest elicit drug manufacture centre was wiped out by a
Black Storm brigade.  The police believe it was the work of a
rival drug manufacturer, due to evidence "found" on the scene.
Every Storyteller who runs an Illuminati campaign will one day
have to repair the damage from the players.  Here are a few
suggestions:

THE SCAPEGOAT
     Blame someone else; someone believable.  In the mundane
world, its best to blame those who are already suspected of
meddling in society.  The CIA, FBI, and NSA are perfect American
examples of potential scapegoats (In Canada, CSIS has bungled so
many covert operations, they'd be perfect targets).  Amongst the
Supernaturals, place the onus on natural enemies or those under
suspicion.  If the operation was against the Werewolves, blame
Pentex, DNA, Vampires, or the Shadow Lords.  When against the
Vampires its best to leave evidence accusing the Lupines, the
Sabbat, or the Tremere.  The Technocracy-Tradition feud is
perfect cover for Illuminati activities as well.  Note that the
arrogance of the Supernaturals toward the mundanes predisposes
them to blame the nearest paranormal source for the trouble. 
Except for the Arcanum, most Supernaturals to not consider normal
humans that great a threat.

DISINFORMATION
     So they're sure its some sort of secret society.  Fine. 
Give them a secret society, but make sure it has nothing to do
with the real Illuminati.  The Enigmatic Stratagem have this down
to a science.  Everyone is convinced that the American government
is in league with Aliens and that they are using alien
technology.  With the Stratagem's strange equipment and the
presence of the "Greys" have done much to perpetuate this
falsehood (as has the activities of the Technocrats and certain
Umbral beings).  While everyone is concerned with the "Alien
Conspiracy" no one suspects mundane humans plotting the overthrow
of mankind.  Its also noteworthy that there so many sceptics
about Alien involvement, that most people are convinced there is
NO Conspiracy at all.
     The main purpose of Disinformation is to mix as much
falsehood in with the facts to lead any researchers on a wild
goose chase.  The more convinced they are in the fabrication, the
more embarrassed they will be when they are proven wrong.  This
tends to lower the credibility of the researchers (very important
if they eventually find out something about the True Illuminati).
     Think about it.  Just look at how Steve Jackson games are
selling lots of things named  Illuminati, and how the concept of
Illuminati have spread far and wide  thanks to R.A.Wilson... the
real Illuminati are hard to find among the  wannabees and
enthusiasts. 


DISCOURAGEMENT
     A favourite of the all the Illuminati, the main goal of
Discouragement is to make the investigation more trouble than its
worth.  Corporations who involve themselves in Illuminati affairs
see their stocks fluctuate wildly or become the objects of
government investigations.  At first the "problems" are just bad
enough to serve as warnings.  If things persists, however, they
can become crippling.  While this method has the potential of
encouraging investigation, often the individual organization's
instinct for self-preservation will convince them otherwise.
     Discouragement tactics range depending on the Society. 
Global Elite rely on "physical" means (beatings, bombings, and
assassinations; often disguised as terrorist acts) or political
pressure, Shadow Bank using monetary means, the Pantheon
resorting to slander campaigns from the pulpit (Interesting Plot
Hook:  Exactly why is the Pantheon so anti-RPG?  Maybe the Blood
Covenant is behind TSR?), and the Blood Covenant involved in
curses and other mystical incantations.

COUNTERCONSPIRACIES
     "The best way to avoid a conspiracy is to start it
yourself". So the  Illuminati creates groups apparently opposing
them, to lure in anybody  trying to find them or their holdings.
The Enigmatic Stratagem probably  manipulates the UFOlogists
trying to make the government release secret  documents, and the
Blood Covenant runs debunkers and sceptic  organizations which
are used to strike at their competitors in the occult  world. 
Additionally, the Global Elite probably controls anarchists.  For
every attack on a holding owned by their Society, there are a
half dozen levied on Enemies (both in the mundane and
Supernatural world).


                       d) Societies within Societies
                               (The Creeds)

     So, you thought the Societies were a homogenous mix of
infiltrators, blackmailers, and spies?  Wrong.  The Conspiracy
and its three main tenants (Control the World, Fight the
Supernatural, Enlighten Humanity) have sparked much debate
amongst the higher echelon's of the Illuminati.  What's the most
important tenant?  What should the Societies main purpose be? 
There are many who choose one of the three tenants as their
life's goal (their "Creed") while still others have developed
their own ideas about the Conspiracy and the direction the
Illuminati must follow. 
     Creeds go beyond Society limitations.  In many ways, its
the only thing the Illuminati have in common.  Though Societies
may fight their own petty battles, many times their Creeds still
have relations (though strained they may be).

The Collusionists
     "Conspiracy for Conspiracy's sake".  
     These people have told so many lies, weaved so many
intricate plots, that they have become mentally and emotionally
dependant on the Conspiracy.  The are deathly afraid that if the
machinations ever ended, that their life would shallow and
worthless.  The Collusionists have no other goals but to keep the
lie alive; to do nothing but forge endless (and often
meaningless) plots and schemes.   Followers of the status-quo,
they actively fight any attempt by a Society or Creed to hinder
or abet the Conspiracy (because it could eventually cause its
end).   They are a small faction, but present in all Societies,
most notably the Global Elite (and some say the Enigmatic
Stratagem).  

The Enlightened
     "The Conspiracy is not to enslave, but inform".
     This Creed seeks a return to the origins of the Illuminati,
when the role of the Societies was to educate and assist humans
throughout the world.  Though they have no love for the
Supernaturals, they see no reason to wipe them out.  Likewise,
world domination is a trivial and useless endeavour.  Only by
enlightening mankind to the possibilities the world has to offer,
can freedom from all forms of oppression be guaranteed.  Many of
the Enlightened have adopted Ascension-like beliefs, making many
wonder if those of this creed are not being influenced by
Harmonist elements.  They are very common in the Blood Covenant
and are the most common Creed-members in the Keepers of Secrets. 
Also suspected of having members in the Enigmatic Stratagem,
though they may have been distorted by the Aliens twisted
philosophies (whatever they may be).

The Harmonists
     "The Conspiracy is for everyone, both mundane and
supernatural".
     A throw-back to the Architects of Reason, the Harmonists
believe that the Supernaturals should not be enslaved,
imprisoned, or destroyed.  Instead, they should be part of the
Illuminati; using their powers to the benefit of humanity rather
then its exploitation.  A very small and silent Creed, the
Illuminati regard Harmonists with the same hatred and fear that
the Sabbat have for the Path of Evil Revelations.  Harmonists
must remain secretive, lest they be hunted down and eradicated. 
Nonetheless, there is believed to be quite a few Harmonists in
the Enigmatic Stratagem and the Shadow Bank.

The Ideologists
     "Only our Conspiracy is the true Conspiracy"
     Loyalty to one's Society is the most important to members of
this Creed.  Only the Society has the correct path to victory of
the supernatural.  Only they are worthy of becoming Illuminati. 
The other Societies are only pretenders to their throne, anti-
popes to their divine right of leadership.  In short, all other
Illuminati are inferior and should bow their will.  These
groups clash on a regular basis with the Court, and despise their
rule.  They appear in sizable numbers in most of the
Conspiracies.

The Nihilists  
     "The Battle is lost.  Humanity is doomed"
     Gloomy, depressed, and perhaps unbalanced, these society
members are convinced that the war with the supernatural has been
lost before it started.  The only recourse is to go out with a
bang, taking as many as the abominations with them as they can. 
There are stories of Nihilists going into Vampire clubs with a
backpack full of thermite or napalm, destroying dozens of
vampires in the process.  Most of these have been dismissed by
Vampires as suicidal Hunters, but the Illuminati is deathly
afraid of the publicity these actions cause.  Because of this,
this society has been officially banned by the Court.  In many
ways, the hatred of the Nihilists equal the Camarilla's hatred
for the Sabbat, or the Sabbat's hatred of the Path of Evil
Revelations.  However, these believers still exist in small
numbers; more rise up everyday, despite the many who die.

The Overseers
     "There is only one path for Humanity.  The path that we, the
Illuminati, forge".
     These are by far the largest Creed, not only in power but in
influence.  The Kings have actively supported the Overseers in
their Societies, for it has given them an excuse to grab power
wherever they find it.  The main goal of the creed is simply the
complete domination of mankind.  Once they have the mundanes in
check, they can use its great resources to curb the
Supernaturals.  Many within the Creed believe that what they are
doing is for the benefit of mankind, but there are just as many
greedy cutthroats who do it for the personal influence it gives. 
The Court has long tried to inhibit the Overseers, but it hasn't
the will (or the power) to ban such a large group of individuals
(especially since some Queens have fallen under their control). 
As stated above, the Creed exists in all Societies; the Global
elite is securely under their control.

The Paranoids
     "There is only one way... inwards"
This creed (which is related to the Collusionists) is unofficial
but quite prevalent in many societies. The paranoids have seen
too many friends turn out to be traitors, heard too many awful
secrets and know far too much.  They cannot leave, they cannot
relax and the only way to survive is to  fit in while trying to
understand what is really going on. They hide  their fears under
a veneer of loyalty, and often do their outmost to  serve the
Conspiracy while constantly watching for trouble. Most of them 
simply try to avoid it, always keeping to the safe side or hiding
behind  the party-line. 

The Purifiers
     "What you call genocide, I call a day's work".
     While other Creeds only condone the hinderance of the
supernatural, the Purifiers believe in their total destruction. 
The exact reasons for their hatred is varied; xenophobia, a
religious hatred of "evil", human supremacy and purity of the
race (of any race or gender).  Supernaturals are seen as 
unnatural and polluted strains of humanity; many feel they its
their duty of eliminate aberrations for the good of Homo Sapiens
everywhere.  The Purifiers dream is to set up Auschwitz-style
extermination camps where Vampires, Werewolves, Mages, etc. would
be exterminated.   While no one will admit to being a Purifier
(most masquerade as other Creeds), their presence is felt
throughout the Illuminati.

The Scholars
     "Knowledge is Power."
     This creed is common among some Bishops, who have spent all
their time studying in the libraries of their basilicas. They no
longer care for the eventual defeat of the supernatural or the
eventual fate of humanity.  Instead they have become obsessed
with the wast amounts of knowledge  their society has gathered,
and want to get more, to use the Conspiracy  to learn all secrets
(this creed is quite common among the Keepers of  Secrets). They
do their best to gather as much information as possible  about
the supernatural, their enemies or the world in general. They are 
not very powerful, but very tenacious when they want to learn
something.  

The Supplanters
     "To control the beast, you must remove its claws, pull its
teeth, pluck out its eyes, and cut out its ears.  After that its
rather harmless".
     The Supplanters are the second-largest Creed, just behind
the Overseers in overall support.  They have the direct backing
of the Court (who seek to control the Overseers and Purifiers
advocacy and growth).  The Supplanters see only the curbing of
influence the Supernaturals as a worthwhile goal.  Those such as
Vampires require pawns to safeguard their existence and control
mankind.  By removing those pawns, ideally without them knowing,
the Illuminati take control of what the supernatural sees and
hears.  As the Supernaturals have become dependant on their
holdings and mortal pawns, so they have given the Illuminati a
potent tool in which to misdirect or even destroy them. 
Ironically, if knowledge of the Illuminati were to become
widespread, their dependence on holdings would be their demise. 
Though they haven't dominance in any society, their presence has
at least restrain the influence of the Overseers in most of the
societies (excluding the Global Elite, which is firmly under
Overseer control).

The Unionists
     "There are no Societies.  There is only the Conspiracy".  
     Seeing themselves as visionaries, the Unionists yearn for a
day when the Societies can put aside their differences and join
as a single unit.  Only then, they reason, can the Conspiracy be
brought to fruition.  They have sought to build relations between
friendly Illuminati (such as the Global Elite and the Pantheon),
as well as bring peace to feuding Societies (Pantheon and the
Blood Covenant).  Receiving nominal support from the Court, the
Unionists have managed to be a thorn in the side of the other
Creeds.  They are powerful enough to resist absorbtion from the
other creeds, not threatening enough to risk a ban, and have
enough support to cause many to wonder whether separate societies
are a good idea.  They exist in all Societies (save, perhaps, the
Enigmatic Stratagem; the seem to want to keep as far away from
the other Illuminati as possible).
