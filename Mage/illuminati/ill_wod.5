                  Chapter Five:  The World of Darkness

     The following is a brief guide on the relationship between
the Illuminati and the other denizens of the World of Darkness. 
Note that these relationships are based my personal concept of
the Illuminati and WoD in general.  You should feel free to alter
or scrap any or all of this information if it doesn't fit with
your campaign.

                        a) Vampire: The Masquerade

THE CAMARILLA

     "The Illuminati and the Tremere are one and the same.
      It is an obvious ploy to divert the blame incurred by their
      scheming actions.  This mythical group does not exist. "
          -Victor, Ventrue ex-prince of Peterborough, Ontario.

     The Vampires suffer from the elitist philosophy which
tends to relegate mortals to the roles of food and petty
annoyances.  Except for the Arcanum and some Hunters, the
Camarailla doesn't see humans as a serious threat.  
     Of all the Kindred, the Tremere have been the most
victimized by the Societies.  Whether by design or just chance,
the Tremere have named their information network "The Illuminati"
(See the Vampire Players Guide).  This offered the True
Illuminati an opportunity to pass of some of the blame to
the Tremere.  While the Tremere are not innocent by any means,
they've been blamed for many conspiracies that they have had no
part in.
     The Elder Vampire of the Camarilla are most likely to have
any idea about the Illuminati.  The Societies have laboured hard
to taint any truths they may hold with fraudulent information. 
Still, its more than likely that there are some Elder Vampires
(Especially Methululahs and those of low Generation) would know
something about the Illuminati.  
     
THE SABBAT (AND THE FALSE HAND)

     "While I have never heard of them, I have noticed strange    
      things in the city.  This requires more investigation"
          -Piper, Nosferatu Bishop of Peterborough, Ontario

     Sabbat cities offer the opportunity for the Illuminati to
take control of mundane institutions.  Because the Sabbat sever
all ties to the mortals, there is often a control vacuum in the
city.  While the Lupines, Mages, and Technocracy have tried to
fill this void; the Illuminati usually find the most success
(generally due to its ability to "blend" in with the rest of
humanity).  The Sabbat generally don't have the contacts with the
mundanes to have any chance of discovering the presence of the
Illuminati (and the Illuminati generally doesn't tackle with them
directly, preferring to use some militant holdings to deal with
them).  The Societies feel that the Sabbat are the worst threat
the Vampires pose to Humanity and that they should be eliminated
at all costs.  Even the normally passive Harmonist Creed have no
love for the Sabbat.
     Note that since both the Sabbat and the Illuminati use the
term "Bishop" as status rank, the Societies members can be
confused with the Sabbat in case of a breech.  This of course,
only benefits the Illuminati.

THE TRUE HAND

     "Illuminati?  No Comment."
          -<Deleted>, Member of the True Hand

     The relationship between the True Hand and the Illuminati 
is a reverse to the normal link between the Societies and the
Supernatural.  Of the True Hand, the Illuminati know almost
nothing.  They know they exist, but know little more than they
are the "Secret Masters" of Ventrue fame.  However, its very
likely that the True Hand knows much about the Illuminati and its
purposes.  While both the Hand and the Illuminati both are
protecting mankind, the Societies do so at the expense of the
Supernaturals.  The Pacifier Creed has the Hand especially
nervous, for they advocate the genocide of those of Supernatural
origin.  But to actually crush the Illuminati would by very hard
and damaging to the Hand.  For one thing, the Illuminati (in one
form or another) vastly predates the True Hand. As such, they
have a lot more experience in fighting phantom wars. To actually
crush the Societies, while possible, would greatly tax the Hand's
resources and undoubtedly reveal their existence for all the
world to see.  So, the True Hand wait in secret, erecting
invisible walls to hem in the growth of the Illuminati.  They
hope these barriers will be enough, for they dread the day the
will have to deal the Societies of the Pax Concordat.
     [Author Note:  Depending on your own campaign, the True Hand
could be a complete mystery to the Societies, or both will have
complete knowledge of each other (and fight an invisible cold
war).  You may also have the True Hand influence or even control
the Illuminati, but I personally discourage that (especially the
control part).  That would make the Illuminati redundant; we
already have enough supernatural conspiracies.]

THE SHAMANS OF BELTANE

     "Fantasy is the truth no one wants to hear."
          -Corvus Beltane, 8th Generation Tremere.

     Jacques DeCarnac is believed to be the only Bishop to have
successfully rebelled from the Illuminati.  A member of the Blood
Covenant, he managed to smuggle one of the Basilica's texts to a
certain Tremere called Corvus Beltane (obviously a pseudonym;
real name unknown).  Corvus, a former Verbena embraced by a
jealous Tremere,  had promised Carnac the very secrets of Vampire
Thaumaturgy.  However, the traitor was killed by the Court's 
Cadre before he could collect.  From that day in 1634, Corvus
spent his waking hours in hiding, attempting to crack Fabula's
multi-level encryption sequences.  When Corvus cracked the codes,
he thought he had discovered the source of much of the Tremere's
bad image; a human organization that has pull the strings of many
occult organizations.  However, the false paragraphs in the book
led him to many erroneous conclusions.  For instance, he believes
the Blood Covenant to be much more powerful than it really is,
controlling the other thirty Societies with an iron fist.  He
also falsely affirms that the Blood Covenant is behind the Path
of Evil Revelations and the Sabbat.   Beltane was quick to tell
the others in the Camarilla about his findings but mistrust for
the Tremere (and a healthy dose of Illuminati Disinformation and
Scapegoating) convinced all concerned it was nothing but an
ill-conceived scheme to redeem his clan.  Especially since no one
but Beltane could understand the book's contents.
     Beltane would later loose his evidence while using the book
to find "the Mystical secrets of the Blood Covenant".  A Clique,
hiding in wait at this chosen site, attacked the Warlock and
forced him to flee in panic.  Unfortunately, he dropped the
book in the early moments of the attack and lost his only
evidence of the Illuminati.  Beltane has since gone underground
with his information,  along with a few Tremere and Ventrue.
Corvus has now devoted his unlife to routing out the Illuminati
and destroying it.  Calling themselves the "Shamans of Beltane"
they spent some time in Peterborough, Ontario; once the last
bastion of Camarilla rule in Central Ontario.  Staying there
until the Sabbat takeover, the group went on to Ottawa and then
moved into an undisclosed location in the states.  The current
whereabouts of the Shamans of Beltane are unknown, but the
Illuminati are dying to have a talk with them...
     [Author: Peterborough is near my home-town of Havelock and
the location of our Vampire LARP.  I actually played Corvus, who
was an 8th Generation Tremere.  Also played Piper, the 9th Gen.
Nosferatu who would eventually cause the city's fall to the
Sabbat...hehehe]

                        b) Werewolf: The Apocalypse

THE TRIBES OF GAROU (INCLUDING ALL WERE-CREATURES)

     "Mortals are slaves to superior powers, whether it be us
      or the Vampire pawns of the Wyrm.  To suggest they are 
      capable of this level of manipulation is laughable."
          -Krieg Iron-Hand, Shadow Lord

     The Werewolves and other Were-creatures are the hated enemy
of the Illuminati.  It was the Garou Impergium which sparked the
Growth of the Blood Covenant and indirectly the other Societies. 
However, while their hate of the Garou is strong, the Illuminati
has done very little harm them.  That occurs because the agents
of the Wrym have done such a good job of depleting the Werewolves
numbers that they haven't nearly been the threat to humanity they
once were.  Still, those Garou like the Glass Walkers and the
Shadow Lords have made forays into the cities to make pawns of
mankind.  It is then when the Illuminati have cracked down upon
them.  The Garou rarely have the resources in the human world to
even hint at the presence of the Illuminati.  The Glass Walkers
may have their suspicions, but generally the Garou are the least
informed about the Illuminati.  Not due to any deficiency in
skill or power; more likely due to their single-minded battle
against the Wyrm and its servants.

THE WYRM (INCLUDING PENTEX)

     "Yes, we have had contact with a few of them, more of which  
      I will not say.  Draw your own conclusions if you wish.     
      You know the way out."
          -Unnamed Pentex Board Member.

     Wyrm minions and those of the great multinational
corporation Pentex have had clashed with the Illuminati on
occasion.  However, due to the great power the Wyrm has on the
planet, the Societies have had only partial success in stemming
their domination of humanity.  With the legions of Fomori and
other creatures at Pentex's disposal, any Acquisition generally
leads into a hostile takeover (something the Courts want to use
sparingly).  As such, the Illuminati pick and choose their
targets carefully, making sure they have some scapegoats that
their enemy will actually believe in (generally the Garou). 
     Pentex and the Wrym-agents do know of the Illuminati's
existence and may (depending on your campaign) have subverted the
Blood Covenant.  Otherwise, they don't see the Societies of much
of a threat.  This is not a foolish attitude because its quite
possible that Pentex could easily overcome any Societies attempt
at subversion and control.  Whether they could match the
Illuminati in a head-on battle is unknown, but it is a
possibility.

                          c) Mage: The Ascension

THE TRADITIONS
     
     "Oh yes, I've heard all sorts of stories about conspiracies, 
      alien viruses from deep space, honest politicians.  Won't   
      believe it, though, 'till I see it."
          -Platon, Virtual Adept.

     As stated in the introduction, the Illuminati have very
little hatred for the Mages of the world.  They fear the Mages
for their ability to warp reality and for the strange insanity
and occurrences (Quiet and Paradox Flaws) which happen around
them.  This, along with the practise of recruiting Acolytes had
convinced the Illuminati that its in humanity's best interest to
subvert the Mages as well.  Ascension, in all its forms, is an
alien concept to most members of the Pax Concordat.  Most believe
if anyone has the right to enlighten mankind, its going to be the
Illuminati and other mundanes.
     As with the Werewolves, the Societies will not bother with
Mages unless the involve themselves in activities that will
control or harm mundanes.

THE TECHNOCRACY

     "The whole concept is fascinating but pointless.
      If sleepers were capable of such things, the Technocracy
      would never have been needed.  As you see, we are still
      here.  We are still needed."
           -Dr. Francis Cavalier, Iteration X

     Years ago, the Illuminati voted to allow the Technocracy
freedom to create the Age of Reason.  It is generally believed
that this was done to further subvert the Supernaturals
(specifically Mages and other Umbral beings) as well as provide
more weapons to use against their enemies.  However, now its
generally seen as a catastrophic mistake.  The Technocracy now
rivals the Illuminati is total size and has a stranglehold on the
minds of the entire world.  If the Illuminati could unite, they
may be able to wipe them out.  However, with all the infighting
(and the questionable loyalties of the Shadow Bank and the
Enigmatic Stratagem), its unlikely they would have the strength
to accomplish this goal.
     The New World Order has long suspected a shadow government
paralleling their's.  The Enigmatic Stratagem (along with the
Cadres of the Court) have been very efficient in hiding their
existence, but the NWO probing continues.  However, the NWO has
no idea that the Illuminati exist (at least not that they are not
Supernatural-controlled) and can be easily convinced that the
Vampires, and especially the Traditions (like the Virtual Adepts)
are involved.  While its only a matter of time until the Technos
find out about the Societies, there have been rumours that
someone is preventing the NWO from discovering the Illuminati. 
This supposition has been forwarded by the same people that
believe the Shadow Bank and Syndicate are one in the same. 
However, it IS possible that some remnant of the Architects of
Reason could be subtly manipulating the NWO (as well as the rest
of the Technocracy) away from the Illuminati.  This makes many
wonder how true these rumours really are.

THE NEPHANDI AND THE MARAUDERS

     "So, you want to know about the Illuminati...
      Are you willing to pay...the price?"
          -Redden Malthus, Nephandi

     These fugitives from beyond the Gauntlet may or may not know
about the Illuminati.  Even if these two powers learned of its
existence, it will not easily share this information.  Not many
people believe the ranting of the Marauders and the Nephandi
would tend to exact a...heavy price for such information.
     As for the Illuminati, they consider both these Mages more
threatening to the welfare of humanity than the Technocracy.  It
partially vindicates their decision to let the Technocracy set up
the Age of Reason (though still considered a grave mistake on
many more grounds).  The Illuminati will terminate any Marauder
on sight and will conceder the same fate for any Nephandi.


                          d) Wraith: The Oblivion

WRAITHS (AS A WHOLE)

     "I care not for the Quick.  We are the dead and we 
      have a more important problems that require our attention."
           -Elias, Hierarchy Centurion

     Since Wraiths generally do not involve themselves in the
lands of the Quick (except to protect their fetters and nurture
their Passions), they are not a threat to the Illuminati.  In
fact, some within the Blood Covenant have good relationships with
these denizens of the Shadowlands.  Obviously, unless the Wraith
has spend much time in the real world, they are not going to know
about the Illuminati.  So generally both sides leave each other
alone.
     Of course, its been said that there are a lot of former
Society members in the Shadowlands as Wraiths.  Some say these
Wraiths even formed their own Society called "The Silhouette". 
Again, wether The Silhouette exists and its relationship with the
other Illuminati is up to the Storyteller.


                            e) The Other Beings

MUMMIES

     "Don't take the Illuminati so lightly.  Mortals are capable  
      of much more than we could ever dream of; I know for a fact 
      that all those who call themselves Illuminati are not all
      Tremere."
           -Amonhotep, Mummy

     Mummies, the undying remnants of the Egyptian way of life,
know well the existence of the Illuminati.  They may have well
been part of the early Blood Covenant before the battle between
Set and Osiris forced them to be part of the Spell of Life.  For
the most part, Mummies are more concerned with the eternal cycle
of their lives and joining Horus' battle with the Followers of
Set, to be worried about the Illuminati and humans in general. 
There is one mummy who has been "inducted" into the Illuminati
(The Blood Covenant, of course), but its un known whether he did
so of free will and whether they Society can control him
throughout his many lifetimes.  It is clear that though they may
have been part of the Societies at one time, Mummies are now
considered no better than the rest of the Supernaturals: Pawns
and potential enemies.
     The Illuminati cares very little about the Mummies.  They
have done very little harm to humanity and have not sought to
dominate them.  Even if they did impose their will on a number of
humans, it is impossible to kill a Mummy permanently.  So the
Societies tend only to control/subvert these types of Mummies
while they're in the land of the living.  This includes the evil
Bane Mummies of the Vampire Set.


IMMORTALS (HIGHLANDER: THE QUICKENING NET.SUPPLEMENT)

     "There can be only one?  I wonder what will happen when the  
      last Immortal gets The Prize and finds out what's REALLY    
      going on in the world.  The suspense is killing me!"
          -Nicholas "The Razor" Caliburn, Immortal

     Immortals, like Mummies, may know about the Illuminati.  It
depends on how old the Immortal is and where they lived. 
Luckily, the Immortals are often more concerned with "The Game"
and winning "The Prize" to be worried about mortal secret
societies.  However, there are those Immortals who have carved
their own Empires on the backs of mundanes and have sought out
groups like the Societies.  Its these Immortals that mostly
concern the Illuminati.
     The Illuminati have take great pains to make sure that the
Immortals do not discover their existence.  The Watchers, the
organization that conducts surveillance on Immortals, could be
such a defense measure the Societies (most likely the Keepers of
Secrets) have erected.  The Hunters would be a suitable
assassination tool for those Immortals who did get too close. 
Again, this is up to Storyteller approval (but it explains a
great many things).
