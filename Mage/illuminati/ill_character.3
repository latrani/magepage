                         Chapter Three: Character

     While Illuminati was originally conceived as an omnipresent
enemy for characters to face, it is conceivable that people would
actually like to play characters involved in the great
Conspiracy.   Though compared to the Supernaturals in the World
of Darkness, agents of the Societies are often pretty weak in
comparison.  However, they do have a very powerful organization,
rich in resources and talent,  actively backing them up on
missions.  Against the Abominations, a character Knight cannot
hold his own in a direct fight.  Yet the Illuminati have more
tools at their disposal than mere guns or explosives.  There are
more subtle ways to harm your enemies.

                         a)  Creating A Character

i) CONCEPT
     Any concept is possible with Illuminati characters, the more
unorthodox the better.  Anything from Archbishops to Zookeepers
are acceptable and encouraged.  Stereotypical agents are not a
good idea!

ii) NATURE AND DEMEANOUR
     The character's Demeanour is the facade he puts up around
him.  Therefore the player is free to choose any Demeanour that
fits his character concept. 
     Nature is another matter.  Those illuminati of ranks Rook,
Bishop, Queen or King; as well as those Pawns or Knights who were
not brainwashed may choose freely.  However, those characters who
have been put through mind control techniques have Natures set by
their captors.  This is often Conformer, Fanatic, Conniver, and
Loner; though it could be others too.  Natures of Brainwashed
victims are usually chosen by the Storyteller.   

iii) RANK
     As far as characters are concerned there are only two ranks
which will suit adventuring characters, that of Knight and Pawn. 
Rooks may be allowed as player characters, depending upon the
particular Chronicle and Storyteller.  Each Rank's duties will
list special Character Generation rules and required
skills/backgrounds.  See part b) for more information on the
ranking system of the Societies.

iv) SOCIETY
     This author recommends that your Storyteller choose which
Society you belong to, this especially if you a Pawn or
Brainwashed Knight.  Its almost never a matter of individual
choice.  
     Societies will also recommend Backgrounds and Skills that
would be of use to them (and why, perhaps, you were chosen by
them).

v) ATTRIBUTES, ABILITIES, ADVANTAGES

Attributes: 7/5/3
Abilities: 13/9/5
Backgrounds: 7
Virtues: 9 (a personal house rule for all mortals; use 7 if you   
         wish)
Freebie Points: Variable (Dependant on Rank)

vi) MONEY AND EQUIPMENT
     Besides personal goods, most equipment and weapons needed
for your missions will be provided to you by the Societies
themselves.  While individualism is tolerated (and sometimes
encouraged), the Illuminati frown on equipment and clothing which
draw attention to the agent (or his employers; ie. no heavy
weaponry, explosives, tactical nuclear weapons, etc.)
     Some unique gear is listed in part e) and f).

                             b) Society Ranks

PAWNS
     At the lowest end of the hierarchy is the Pawn.  Pawns are
the workhorse of any Illuminati Society, a network of contacts
and slaves that are given the most unimportant tasks.  They are
recruited from ordinary citizens, chosen specifically for their
ability to integrate into society and their usefulness to the
Illuminati.  There are many types of pawns:  Unwitting helpers,
dupes, hired experts and consultants, members of front
organizations. 
     The methods of Initiation vary amongst this rank, but
Brainwashing is rarely done.  Its not necessary for them, for
they hold no information, nor are they a serious threat to
security.   Societies tend to follow the acronym M.I.C.E: Money,
Ideology, Coercion, Ego.   Blackmail, Bribes, and Persuasion
using both beliefs and narcissism are (and have always been)
quick and easy ways to ensure loyalty and obedience.  Pawns are
often controlled through a Society's holding (often a Holding
they employed with).  They are often totally unaware they are
working for a secret society, let alone one as powerful as an
Illuminati. 
     At best, a Pawn can be considered a "Sleeper" agent (not to
be confused with the Mage term for unawakened humans). 
Continuing their lives unimpeded, they are only used when
circumstances warrant it.  Rarely are they used in sensitive
operations (unless they have been Brainwashed) and are never
combat trained.  Typical missions for a Pawn are information
gathering, shadowing/tailing suspects, research, and petty
crimes. 
    Supernaturals are also recruited as Pawns (its the only rank
that allows them as members).  However, they are chosen for their
unique talents rather than their ability to fit in.  They serve
as defensive measures against magically endowed individuals or
those creatures that can easily bypass the mundane security
devices the Illuminati deploy.  Other than the fact that
Supernatural Pawns are always Brainwashed, they are quite similar
to their mundane brothers.

     Character Generation:  No special skills required.  Create a
Mortal/Vampire/Werewolf/Mage/Mummy character as normal.
     Freebie Points: Based on your breed (15 normally for
Vampires, Mages, and Werewolves, 21 for Mortals, 30 for Mummies)  

KNIGHTS
     Knights are the elite shocktroops of the Societies,
expendable agents with specialities in espionage and covert
operations.  Just above Pawns in the hierarchy of the Illuminati,
these fanatical warriors are recruited from ex-service personnel,
former agents and police officers, and anyone who shows who shows
paranormal abilities (Numina). 
     Brainwashing is the normal procedure for Knights.  Only
rarely does someone show the devotion and self sacrifice needed
to be a Knight.  Absolute loyalty is engrained in them throughout
their year-long training in secluded camps throughout the world. 
The Knight is best suited for the tactical elimination of
enemies.  This elimination is ideally (according to the Pax
Concordat) non-violent, but deadly force is also used.
     Knights are experts in surveillance and entrapment, getting
evidence which can be used to persuade or ruin an individual. 
The also have knowledge in commando and other special forces
operations.  Standard operating procedure is to make all covert
operations look like routine terrorist actions.  Sabotage is made
to look like corporate espionage or "Eco-Terrorism";
Assassinations and Bombings are carefully staged to appear the
work of extreme factions of such groups as the IRA. 
     The amount of information a knight knows is totally
dependant on the skills and natural abilities he or she
possesses.  Those with Merits of Iron Will, or have extensive
Numina abilities are often allowed more knowledge about the
Illuminati than the mundane agents with no supernatural
abilities.  Normal agents may know they are working for the
a secret society (and may even given a pseudonym to identify it),
but has no knowledge of its personnel or practices.  Knights
endowed with the necessary special gifts may know a bit more,
such as their immediate superiors and the influence the Society
has over the local area he is assigned to .  Though the exact
number of Knights with Numina is great (around 75-80%), less than
one in ten have the Merits or Transcendental powers to warrant
even nominal insight into the Illuminati.

     Character Generation:  Knights have primaries in Physical
Traits and Skills.  They generally should have a good selection
of espionage and military skills such as Firearms, Subterfuge,
Survival, and Alertness.  The also must take the Lingua skill,
the spoken version of the Rook's Fabula.  Background of use to
the Knights are Contacts and Arcane (you ever notice on the X-
files that the enemy agents always disappear after rounding a
corner and NEVER seem to appear on cameras?) Numina is also very
common with Knights but preferred supernatural abilities vary
with Society.

ROOKS
     Rooks are the cornerstone of any Society, these "enforce"
the Illuminati's will in their respective holdings.  After a
successful Acquisition or Challenge of Dominion, the Rook enters
the scene and maintains order.  Rooks are generally trusted
Illuminati individuals (often born into the Society through
hereditary lines) who were employed by the future Holding months
or years before the Illuminati arrived.
     The masters of subterfuge, manipulation and brainwashing, a
Rook ensures that the Holding is completely "loyal" to the powers
that be.  Rooks are often given a Clique (Society version of a
Cadre) of Knights to help in the pacification of the Holding. 
Often the Rook has an entourage of Brainwashing experts
(themselves being brainwashed pawns) or Knights that have
likewise have the required Intelligence background.
     Using their special abilities, key personnel are Initiated
as Pawns into the Illuminati.  Rooks then stay in the Holding in
small, unimportant positions, watching for insurrection or
outside influence.
     Of all agents in exposed or semi-exposed positions, the
Rooks possess the most knowledge of their Society.  They know
they work for the Illuminati, its name, and their immediate
superior (usually another Knight, but rarely a Bishop).  They
generally have no idea about the scope of the Illuminati but are
still well protected (just in case...).

     Character Generation:  Rooks must Social Traits Primary, but
may choose whether they talk Skills are Knowledges are dominant. 
All Rooks must take the knowledge of Brainwashing, and most have
the Allies, Contacts, or Resources.  Some Rooks have the Merit
Iron Will...

BISHOPS
     Keepers of Society dogma, masters of information, historians
without equal.  Bishops are generally not available to Player
Characters because of their isolated existence.  Bishops are the
masters of the Basilica and has such have historical records
dating back for into what the mundane world calls prehistory. 
Some of the older records include the written versions of the
original human oral-histories, many of which date back to the
latter end of the Impergium.  Each individual Basilica has
different records, depending on its age and original geographic
location.  Besides history, the Basilica holds the records of all
Illuminati members, past and present, and details Society
business and progress form the earliest times.
     There are about a dozen Bishops in each basilica, lead by
one of their number (called an Archbishop).  Bishops are chosen
from the brightest of the mundanes in the general area of the
basilica.  They are snatched from elite schools and from
families who have shown a history of high intelligence.  Many of
the unsolved child abductions are not the work of child molesters
or serial killers, but are in fact the latest inductees into the
Illuminati.  The children are taught from their earliest
moments in the Society that they are the most important force in
their organization and without it, humanity is lost.  Loyalty and
Sacrifice are engrained in their minds, and they are given the
greatest secrets that the Societies have to offer.
     For they learn Fabula, the ancient art of translating
Basilica text.  It is in a long-forgotten dialect, written in an
ancient alphabet, and intricately encoded.  Filled with false
passages, and special paragraphs to mislead the uninitiated, it
takes very intelligent and dedicated individuals to interpret and
copy the text.  In fact, Bishops are the only ones allowed to
take the Fabula skill; it is taught to no other, under penalty of
death.  This system is so complex, that Corvus Beltane (see
"Shamans of Beltane" in Chapter 5) over 350 years to decipher
the code and translate the language and dialect.  Even then, he
did not manage to separate the true passages from the false.  Its
only by these special measures taken to protect the Society's
knowledge that the Illuminati have survived for these millennia.  
    Bishops, due to their wide-spread knowledge of the
Illuminati, are sequestered in their hidden Basilica, protected
by some of the best Knights available.  Mage, Vampire, and Garou
Pawns are often used to prevent Supernaturals from finding the
Basilica and penetrating it via mystical or spiritual means.  So
important are the Bishops to the Illuminati, they often never see
the light of day. 

     Character Generation:  Mental Attributes and Knowledges are
Primary.  Other than taking the Fabula skill, there are no
prerequisites to being a Bishop.

QUEENS
     Queens are the judges of the Illuminati.  Sitting on the
great and powerful Court, the Queen makes sure the rules of the
Pax Concordat are followed to the letter and interpret the
rules are they apply to new situations.  [Author note:  The
"rules interpretations" are important generally if player
characters pursue or inquire about an unorthodox method which
may or may not break the Pax Concordat at (such as, say framing
the target with murder, which might be considered a Hostile
Takeover since violence has been used to gain a Holding). 
Remember, the Courts rule is law! No appeals.  Players who ignore
Court rulings better pray they don't get caught...]
     Chosen from the ranks of the Illuminati (normally, an
experienced Archbishop or trusted Rook), the Queen is inaugurated
into the Court in a secret ceremony in one of the Courts meeting
places.  The Queen (or Quaesitor, using the archaic term) then
looses any influence upon the Society they represent.  Though
they become the greatest power in the Illuminati, they only have
nominal power in their old power structure.  This discrepancy
means that though the Court, as a whole, can reprimand Societies,
individual Queens have no power to enforce the Concordat on their
own (and often do not report observed internal breeches of the
Concordat, due to loyalty to that Society).
     Queens, though they must move to many secret locations, are
almost never caught in the open.  All Quaesitors have personal
Virtual Adepts, other Correspondence Mages, or equivalent
Garou/Vampires to "teleport" them from place to place.  There are
also accompanied by at least one Court-appointed Cadre for
personal protection.   If they must move in the open, they are
given protection unequaled by even heads of state.  Only Kings
warrant greater protection, though they rarely leave their
fortified offices.

     Character Generation:  They are picked from the ranks of
Bishops, Rooks, or very rarely Knights.  Create a character from
those ranks, then give them an extra 30 freebie points.

KINGS
     Legendary controllers of the Societies, they are the most
mysterious of any of the ranks.  They are the supreme rulers of
their own Illuminati, with personal goals that can only be
guessed at.  Because of the secrecy and isolation involved with
the King, the identity (or even gender) of the Society monarch
has become a lasting secret.   A strict hereditary system, Kings
choose their favourite (and/or most gifted) children for their
replacement.  The succession is never announced to the crew and
only the Queen and a special Rook (his "mouthpiece") know when
the change occurs (and the Kings real identity, for that matter). 
    Cloistered in a special floor, exclusively tailored for the
expensive tastes of the King, the Society's leader is NEVER seen
outside their domain.  The floor is impregnable with massive
technological, mystical, and spiritual barriers.  In the history
of the Illuminati, no King has been assassinated, attacked, or
even approached without prior authorization.  Then again, if a
King had been killed, its doubtful they Society would advertize
the fact...

     Character Generation:  They need no special skills besides
being born into the "Royal" family.  Anyway, player characters
are not going to meet a King in their life time, are they?        
     Freebie Points:  As much as they want...



                          Society Rank Variations

     As stated before, the Pax Concordat set a standard ranking
system in times of emergency.   Over time it has been integrated
into the societies.  However, the Societies are loathe to give up
their traditions and even those Creeds who are supported by the
Court are often resentful of the compromises placed upon them by
the Pax Concordat.  [Author note:  Remember, though the Societies
and Creeds believe the Court is a necessary evil, very few are
staunch supporters.  Unlike Vampire society, there are very few
"Ancillae", save perhaps for the members of the Shadow Bank
(which few people trust anyway)]                      
     Therefore, the Societies tend to have varied heiarchies
which though superficially different, generally follow standard
Concordat hiearchy.  They are listed below:

     THE BLOOD COVENANT has seven grades, linked to the planets
and their symbols. Initiation into each grade is surrounded by 
complex mystical rituals and binding oaths (often variations of
the Blood Covenant; the ancient ritual which gives the Society
its name). 
     There are three grades of Pawns used by the Blood Covenant. 
Mundane people and those mundanes who are actively being
manipulated by the Society are sometimes viewed as belonging to
the grade of Earth.  Two grades control the Pawns and are under
the control of the Rook (Jupiter grade) they themselves are
brainwashed pawns:   
     Moon: The Huntress, Queen of spirits, madness and nature.
Mind control,  hedge magic and occult matters. 
     Venus: The Seductress, manipulation and espionage.
     Bishops are part of the grade of Mercury: Great Hermes, the
God of magic and communication. 
      Knights are of Mars: The God of War, military power.
      Rooks belong to grade Jupiter: The Lord of the world (Rex
Mundi), worldly power (due to their direct influence of the
mundane world).
      Queens, because of their visible rulership as a member of
the Court holds the rank of the Sun: The Glorious ruler.
      Finally the King is called Saturn: The Hidden One, the dark
unknown ruler.
     Within the Society, characters are address using lastname
and their rank.  Nicholas Caliburn, a Knight, would be addressed
as Caliburn of Mars.  If he was a Queen, he would be called
Caliburn of the Sun.

     ENIGMATIC STRATAGEM.  As will be said later in this
supplement, not very much is known about the "official" hierarchy
of the Stratagem.  Pawns, in general, are identical to standard
Concordat precepts (or so it seems).  Knights, however seem to be
divided into two distinct groups.  One group dresses and acts
very similar to the New World Order's Men in Black (Dark suits,
mirrorshades, and black Cadillacs).  They generally operate like
any other Knight.  The other group of Knights are actual
Technomancer constructs (like REAL Men in Black and Hit Marks). 
They seem to be totally loyal to the Society and are most common
when dealing directly with Supernaturals (in an obvious ploy to
redirect blame to the Technocracy).  Nonetheless, these "Techno-
Knights" (as they have come to be called) make a lot of
Illuminati VERY nervous.
     Though no one knows about the higher ranks of the Stratagem,
there is no reason to believe that they are any different than
the Society norm.

     THE GLOBAL ELITE only gives higher ranks titles, fitting
with their aristocratic attitudes.  Pawns are not worth of any
moniker (and as such are often considered very expendable; Global
Elite pawns are the worst treated of any of the Societies).  Each
of the higher ranks are considered separate institutions and as
such are somewhat autonomous from each other (this is in contrast
to the familiar "ladder" organization which is consistent with
the other Illuminati).  Knights are part of the "BlackStorm
Brigades", the paramilitary assassins so feared by the Societies. 
     Rooks are divided up by the organizations they represent. 
Those part of the Political arena are part of the "Imperialists",
while those involved in Corporate or Lobbyist activity are known
as the Capitalists and the Arbitrators respectively.  Each Rook
division has its own areas of influence and a multitude of pawns.
     Bishops, known as Coordinators, not only are information
gatherers but act as intermediaries between the BlackStorm
Brigades and the various Rook institutions. They are very
influential in the Global Elite's affairs.
     Queens are not well liked by this Illuminati.  They are
often quarrelsome members of the Society which have been granted
this position to get them out of their hair.  When referring to a
Queen, they Global Elite simply refer to them as their
"Representative".
     The King (or "President") is no different from that of any
other Society, though the Global Elite propaganda may say
differently.

     KEEPERS OF SECRETS.  Rooks and Bishops are the most
prominent in the Keepers of Secrets.  Like the Global Elite, the
Rooks ("Compilers") are separated in several divisions.  However,
they are not autonomous by any means; merely sub-divisions of the
Rook/Compiler organization.  Each Compiler division concentrates
on a certain area:  Some scan the printed media, broadcasts, and
the more interesting areas of the Internet, while still others
listen to phone lines and street "gossip".  The Bishops (or
Archivists) store the information gained for future "reference".
     Pawns are unchanged from Concordat norm and are known in KoS
circles as Allies and Contacts.
     The Representative to the Court (the Queen) is known only as
the Oracle.  There is no known King, which leads to much
speculation on who exactly rules the Keepers of Secrets.  Some
have even gone so far as to allude that the King IS the Oracle. 
If so, this would make this Society the only one which had an
visible leader.  Then again, why would a King leave himself open
to attack?  As with most of the Illuminati, the Lurkers have no
plans to reveal any their mysterious.

     PANTHEON, not surprisingly generally uses religious monikers
for their ranks.  Most pawns are referred to as "The Faithful",
detonating their loyalty to the Society.  Knights are often
called the "Knights Templar" or just Templars to confuse them
with the Throng of the same name (such as is listed in Nephilim:
Occult RPG) and with the those of the Sabbat.  Rooks are referred
to as Archbishops and Bishops as Cardinals (again to confuse
matters).  Queens are referred to as a Hierophant, and the King
is referred to as the Vicar.
     The Vicar has often been linked to the true Pope of the
Catholic church, but its unlikely they are one and the same.  In
fact, though the Pantheon has great influence in Catholic (and
Protestant, Jewish, Islam etc), they keep themselves somewhat
separate from religious hierarchies and positions.

     SHADOW BANK Hierarchy is very Corporate in nature.  Pawns
are the Employees, dutifully "working" this Illuminati.  Knights
belong to Society "Security", while Rooks are part of "Public
Relations".  Bishops are called Executives and the Queen is given
the title of Press Secretary.  There is no single Shadow Bank
King.  It is in fact made up of a council known as the Board. 
The CEO, the head member of the Board fulfils any duties of the
King, while another member that same Board represents the King at
Court meetings (Note: This representation is separate from the
Queen and other Societies send trust Bishops and Rooks to act as
the King's "observers" during Court proceedings).
