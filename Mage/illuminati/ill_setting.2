                    Chapter Two : Setting

     The World of Darkness has already been adequately been
handled in the other White Wolf games.  This work does not change
the scope of that work.  What this does is add a new force into
that bleak landscape.  A force which doesn't have claws or fangs,
cannot dominate or toss fireballs.  This force has existed for
centuries, though none of its members are immortal.  They rarely
confront their enemy directly; never allow themselves to be
discovered.  They are the Secret Societies of Humanity,
collectively known as the Illuminati.  
     
          a) Collective History of the Illuminati.

     Though it has faded into the racial memory of Humanity, the
real beginning of the Illuminati can be traced to the Impergium,
the empire of Werewolves that culled mankind's growth.  Sometime
near the end of the Impergium, village elders started groups to
maintain a history of their people and also to chronicle the
terrible things the Werewolves had done.  This was, of course, an
oral history and was passed down from generation to generation. 
These small groups would later fade in the background of society
as the Garou ended their reign of terror and allowed the
unchecked expansion of humanity.
     The oral history would continue to be spread until the rise
of the Egyptians.  Up to (and including) this time, these people
had been long considered Sages and men of wisdom.  Their
knowledge was desperately sought, and was a valuable commodity. 
A small group of these oral historians, to preserve their legacy
for future generations,  wrote down their millennia-long legacy
on papyrus sheets.  They then took the many books and hid them
away in a false tomb for safe keeping, to prevent the unworthy
from gleaning its secrets.  This tomb was the first Basilica, the
storehouse of the first Secret Society which would be later
called the Blood Covenant.  
     The secret societies sprung up over the millennia, growing
from areas seeded from the Blood Covenant.  These Secret
Societies saw the atrocities committed by the supernatural world,
terrible things that brought back memories of the Impergium.  
The Battle between Set and Osiris, and the Mythic Age of Magedom
were only two of the horrible things which scarred humankind. 
The societies had once thought only about advancing mankind, the
power gained being fringe benefits.  Now the realized that
humanity were not capable of handling their own affairs unguided. 
Now they would control mankind for their betterment, subverting
the supernatural influence and eventually utterly destroying
those abominations. 
     Thus The Conspiracy was formed, the plan for the saving of
mankind.  They would control society from the shadows, never
taking a direct hand in anything.  Instead they would let the
humans serve as pawns, with them not even knowing that they were
being controlled.  From their secret positions they would lead
humanity against the supernatural, erasing their power and
privalage from the mundane world.  The abominations would not be
able to strike back effectively, for they would be unable to find
the true source of the enemy.
     Around the 15th century, when the great age of expansion was
taking place, the Secret Societies (now calling themselves the
Illuminati) were beginning to clash on a regular basis.  When
countries and people had little contact with each other, the
Illuminati could easily work in their respected circles without
difficulty.   Each society had its own goals, which rarely
involved another society's "holdings".  Now the world was getting
smaller, travel between locations would soon be much easier and
less risky.  Already some Illuminati were threatening their cover
by hiring thugs to attack another's holdings.  It seemed as if
the Illuminati would go to war if something wasn't done. 
Thousands of years of work could be undone in but a few short
years.      
     In the year 1492, just as Columbus was reaching the shores
of the New World, the Four Major Secret Societies of the
Illuminati (Global Elite, Blood Covenant, The Pantheon, and The
Keepers of Secrets) met to avert major disaster.  A treaty of
peace, called the Pax Concordat was drawn up between the powers. 
This document laid out a framework in which the Secret Societies
could function without risking the Conspiracy.  A non-violent
means of acquisition and take-over of another Society's holdings
was implemented, as well a strict code of conduct for those
engaged in those activities.  Basilica were updated to guarantee
that all Societies knew the reason for their actions and what
their goals were .  Finally, the Pax Concordat set up a united
front against the Supernatural.  No Illuminati would be alone
against the Abominations.
     The Illuminati have expanded steadily over the last half
millennia.  Two new Societies have been introduced into the Pax
Concordat, the Shadow Bank and the Enigmatic Stratagem (though
its in doubt whether the latter actually follows its precepts). 
Since ancient times, they have remained largely unnoticed by the
general populace.  No one has even suspected they may
exist...until recently.
     It is fashionable in these days to believe in conspiracies
(more so in the World of Darkness).  Since Kennedy's
assassination, there have been those who theorized there is a
phantom government in the United States (and elsewhere).  This
paranoia has only intensified with the apparent coverup of UFO
abductions and sightings.  However, the views of these people are
not seriously shared by the general populace and are not
considered a threat by the Illuminati.  The real threat is the
Supernatural themselves, specifically the two great powers in the
world:  The Vampire Elders and the Technocracy.  If anyone can
find what is going on, these two groups can.
     The Technocracy has been generally oblivious to Illuminati
activity, generally attributing any strange activity to the
Traditions, Garou, or Kindred.   They, in their arrogance, could
never believe a human could ever reach their power.  Its this
"mage supremacist" attitude that has hindered their investigation
into Illuminati-sponsered activity.
     Vampires are the supreme manipulators, or so they thought. 
Princes have become increasingly worried by the strange increase
of Hunter activity and the manipulation of Kindred-held
organizations.  Like the Technocracy, the Elders of the Clans
have been looking to their enemies the Garou (especially the
Glass Walkers) for these attacks on Vampire power.  They
certainly don't believe that Warlock Beltane and his mistaken
beliefs about "powerful human secret societies..."
     Illuminati have always been in a delicate position.  The
Societies must remain active to prevent the further domination of
mankind by the Supernatural (as well as cement their own brand of
control on the populace) but must be very careful to maintain
the veil of secrecy which ensures their existence.  Unless the 
Cadres of the Court maintains its level of vigilance, the
Societies existence could eventually be threatened.

               c) Organization in the Illuminati

     While there are still many differences between Illuminati,
the signing of the Pax Concordat created many standard
institutions common to all the Societies.  The following is an
overview of these common organizations in general.


THE PAX CONCORDAT
     To understand the Illuminati Society, you must first
understand the Pax Concordat.  It IS Illuminati Society.  It is
the guide to which all agents follow, the cornerstone on which
the Conspiracy is now resting.  Everyone in the Society believes
that the Pax Concordat is the only reason why the Illuminati have
kept their secrecy for all these years.   The Pax Concordat is
contained in a large leather-bound tome in each of the Society's
Basilica.  It is a work that is encoded and filled with
misleading passages that only a trained Bishop can understand. 
Though the work has long and specific rules, the Illuminati
hasn't the time needed to contact the Bishop every time they wish
to initiate an acquisition.  So the Societies have condensed the
Pax Concordat into several common sense rules that listed below.

     I)  Secretum:  No Illuminati agent, no matter what his
station, can reveal the existence of the Secret Societies to an
outside member.
     This rule is the most steadfast law.  Like the Vampires and
Werewolves, the Illuminati are very strict in upholding this
edict, for a breech in Secretum could be the end of the
Illuminati's existence.  The penalty for breeching this law is a
lengthy, painful death (which could be dragged out for months). 
Many of the Societies have invented terrible fates for traitors,
generally ensuring that secrecy will be ensured.

     II)  Principalis:  The first priority is the Conspiracy. 
All other duties, whether personal or the work of the Societies
is secondary.
     This rule basically states that if there is a choice between
furthering the Conspiracy and other possible goals, that the
Conspiracy comes first.  In practise, the Societies rarely let
anything get away from their own plans and ambitions, even the
Conspiracy.

     III)  Dominus:  If an Illuminati has influence over the
decisions of a Holding, it is theirs.  No other Illuminati can
exert influence over it unless it is a Challenge of Dominion.     
     If a Society controls enough of a Holding (say by
controlling the President/Chairman or a majority of stockholders)
to make decisions unimpeded, then the whole Holding is theirs. 
No sabotage can be made by rival Societies, unless they formally
declare a Challenge of Dominion.  Again, in practise the
Illuminati rarely let another's conquest run smoothly, though
they make sure the problems cannot be directly traced back to
them.

     IV)  Gravitus:  When undergoing an Acquisition or a
Challenge of Dominion, violence is expressly forbidden. 
Influence and all other non-violent means are the tools you must
use.
     Violence garners too much attention, opening the Illuminati
to possible scrutiny by the outside world.  Therefore influence
through bribes, brainwashing, blackmail, etc. are the only means
to get Holdings.  Of course, violence is used in illegal "Hostile
Takeovers". Societies are not quick to accuse another of such
tactics, however, due to the fact that some past sin (such as a
previous Hostile Takeover) might be dredged up by those blamed.   

     V)  Solus:  Against the Supernatural hordes, the Illuminati
will be as one force.  No Society may deal with the Latebra, to
attack a rival Society or to further their own goals.
     Another steadfast rule of the Illuminati, breaking this rule
as similar consequences as rule I.  Against their mortal enemies,
the Societies must work together as a team, using their special
talents to their best advantage.  Not to do so could be
catastrophic.

     VI)  Prudentia:  The Court has supreme authority in all
matters brought before it.  To ignore or defy its rulings bring
misfortune on the guilty.
     If a breach of the Pax Concordat, or at the very least a
mater of interpreting its rules, is brought before the Court,
then its ruling is made law.  If it is openly defied or
questioned, the perpetrator will be punished.  This includes
censure and lost of rank, to torture and possible death.  The
Court will not be questioned, though many Illuminati only give
lip-service to this law.  In recent history, the Court has lost
much of its power to control its members.  However, the recent
problems with Beltane and his followers have given the Court new
resolve and power.  This power has been transferred onto their
Cadres.


THE CONSPIRACY
     The Conspiracy, as stated numerous times before, is a scheme
that involves all the Societies.  Though the current method of
influence and control of society from the shadows is thought to
stem from the Conspiracy, it really has more to do with the Pax
Concordat than anything else.  Remember, the Conspiracy outdates
the Pax Concordat by centuries.  
     This Conspiracy is not as much a plan as it is a list of
goals.  The Court believes these goals are to be met at any cost,
the Illuminati are merely at tool to that end.  The Societies, on
the other hand use the Conspiracy as a tool for their own plans. 
This often creates a rift in the Society hierarchy as the Queens
of the Court and the Kings of the Illuminati clash over courses
of action.
     In short, the Conspiracy has three broadly-worded precepts,
each interpreted by the Societies to fit their own goals:
     
     1)  The end of Supernatural dominance over humankind.        
     2)  Completely influence the course of the mundane world     
     3)  Raise humanity to an intellectual and enlightened state  

     These lofty goals sound very noble, but it must be stressed
that while the Court wishes to see all three precepts followed,
many of the Illuminati only care about number two: Dominance of
the humankind.   The Creeds (see Chapter 4) within a Society
often debate what Conspiracy precepts are important or redundant,
often leading to heated arguments and even outbreaks of violence. 

THE COURT
     The Court is the supreme tribunal of the Illuminati.  It is
composed up of five Queens, one from each of the Societies of the
Pax Concordat except the Enigmatic Stratagem.  Its not even known
wether the Stratagem even has a Queen, or follows any of the
trapping of Illuminati Society.    
     Every year is a meeting in some neutral place, chosen
randomly from a list of hundreds of locations.  These locations
are owned by the Court and are sometimes used as safe-houses for
agents in danger.  Meetings are also held every time a breech of
the Pax Concordat is brought forth, or when a rule must be
interpreted.  At attendance in the Court are all the Queens of
the Societies, the Archbishops of each Basilica, and possibly
some high-ranking Rooks (acting as personal representatives of
the King).
     To best describe the court is to think of it has a debating
club.  When a matter is brought forth, the evidence is presented,
people give testimony (if you are subpoenaed, you had better show
up!), and then the topic is thoroughly debated.  Finally, a vote
is taken an the result is recorded by the resident Bishops for
their respective Basilica.  The matter is then closed.  Their
rule is final and there is no recourse for appeal.  To defy them
is a dangerous game, though it is one that all the Illuminati
have learned to play very well.  
     While the Court handles all important matters in the
Illuminati, it takes too much organization to organize a meeting
for every seemingly important occurrence.  Therefore, the Court
has smaller "Conclaves", made up of Bishops and Rooks, which
handle lesser matters.  Conclaves are made up of ten members, one
Bishop and Rook from all recognized Illuminati (except, of
course, the Enigmatic Stratagem).  The Conclave makes a detailed
report to the Court every year and has a right to convene a Court
session if the need arises (though they better have a good
reason!).  They also have lesser Court powers and any decisions
rendered are only cancelled a Queen.  There is at least one
Conclave for each of the five Societies which sit on the Court,
plus at least a dozen Conclaves which handle threats to the
Illuminati has a whole (a quarter of which are devoted to keeping
tabs on the Enigmatic Stratagem).


BASILICA
     Originally a small underground tomb or hidden structure, the
modern day Basilica are huge complexes underneath the ground. 
They are multi-story structures, crammed with natural and man-
made obstacles to intrusion.  Mundane forces will meet (if they
ever found the Basilica, unlikely as it may be) a horde of
fanatical, heavily-armed Knights, remote machineguns and
flamethrowers, and tripwire grenades and claymores. 
Supernaturals could find their Umbral passage blocked by a Garou
or Dreamspeaker Pawns, and Correspondence will often be blocked
by interesting Technomancer constructs.  While successfully
invading a Basilica is possible, its almost always a suicide
mission.
     Most of the Basilica is dedicated to the vast library,
composed of stone tablets, papyrus, leather-bound tomes, and even
computer programs.  Connected to the Library is an extensive
complex of sleeping quarters, recreation and entertainment
complexes for the Bishops.  There are also dark areas for
Initiation and torture, as well as extravagant floors dedicated
solely for King and Queen use.  
     Note that player characters, unless working for the
Illuminati (and brainwashed into loyalty), will likely never find
a Basilica, let alone successfully penetrate it.


SOCIETY HIERARCHY
     At one time each society had its own ranking system, each
corresponding to their unique world view.  The Pax Concordat set
up a standard system of Society status to be followed by all
Illuminati in emergency situations.  During those important
occasions, when they were fighting against supernatural forces,
its important to know everyone's place in their own Society.  
There is enough rivalry between the Illuminati already without
adding the arguments over leadership.  Over the years this
ranking system  has been integrated into the Society's power
structure.  Though they may be referred to by different names and
have slightly different arrangements, most societies now follow
the standard Concordat ranks.
     The current hierarchy was based on the game of chess.  This
was how most of the Society leaders thought of the Conspiracy at
that time.  The King was the leader of the Society, given
authority questionable only by the Court.  The Queen (also called
a Quaesitor) was given a seat on the Court and no longer concerns
themselves with Society affairs.  Rooks control the holdings of
the Society, while Knights act as its enforcers.  Bishops are the
true "sages" of the Illuminati and are the keepers of the
Society's Basilica.  Finally the term Pawn was given to all
those who are under the control of the Society, whether directly
or indirectly.  More on the hierarchy in Chapter Three.


CADRES
     The Cadre are the elite troubleshooters of the Court,
created to help solve the growing problems facing the Societies. 
Each Society represented in the Court must donate a number of
promising Knights and Pawns to form Cadres.  This multi-society
band of agents, numbering anywhere from four to more than a
dozen, must swear their allegiance to the Court and them alone. 
Failing to do so results in the Court's own brand of Initiation
(involving very unpleasant Brainwashing techniques).      
     The Cadre's responsibility is to fix any problem the Court
thinks is a possible threat to Illuminati security.  This
includes potential rouge agents (rare as they may be), lost texts
from a Basilica, and possible uncovering of Society activities by
supernatural or mundane sources.  The Cadres are spies,
assassins, interrogators, commandos, and terrorists all at the
same time.   Though their importance is great, Cadres know almost
nothing about the Societies they work for.  They are gathered
together secretly and told their mission via tape recorder or
video tape (watch Mission: Impossible for ideas).  They may know
their objectives, but will NEVER know the reasons behind them.    
      With the success of the Cadres, it wasn't long until the
individual Societies began fielding similar groups as the Cadres
filled with only their own faithful agents.  Called Cliques,
these groups fill similar roles as the Cadres, though may also be
called on in Acquisitions, Challenges of Dominion, and Hostile
Takeovers...
