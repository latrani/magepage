   Dear Elliot:
  </p>
  <p>
   I thought I'd send a personal note and not the usual form
  letter that accompanies informational requests. I was delighted
  to hear from you and further delighted that you remembered me.
  Your father and I,were great friends ever since our days of
  rowing crew for harvard. Let me again express my condolences
  concerning his disastrous reassignment to Tokyo. He did ask me to
  look after you and your mother. I think I even felt a little
  fatherly pride when you followed in your father's footsteps and
  joined us. And now you are a Member of the Ivory Tower I hear....
  I also hear that you scored in the top 4 percentile in both
  Refutation and Spurious philosophy.
  </p>
  <p>
   I understand that you are trying to put together a decision
  for which study group to join, I further understand that because
  of the Academic infighting that finding out anything about the
  subject matter aside from the name of the study group is like
  pulling teeth. It wasn't allways this way. I have some rank
  however, and rank does have it's perks. So I'll skip the cloak
  and dagger routine,after all you are family. Keep it under your
  hat old sock.
  </p>
  <p>
   Our study group is dedicated to the study of the usefulness
  and potential power of religion. As my good friend Clayton
  Eberhard stated so eloquently to the Ivory tower council so long
  ago " at present, we have no method to eradicate the tendency
  towards emotion,mysticism and religious seeking in mankind. What
  cannot be eradicated must be made to serve!"
  </p>
  <p>
   You must understand that at the time of the industrial
  revolution when we were formed, the technocracy had taken a
  number of serious defeats at the hands of the Celestial chorus
  and the Dreamspeaker Luddites. Religion and a return to natural
  values were standing in the way. Rather than fight them directly
  and make martyrs of them we decided to Infiltrate and destroy
  them from within by destroying that which gave them
  power....Faith.
  </p>
  <p>
   Make no mistake, Elliot, There is not one of us that believes
  in god,No matter what you have been told by other jealous study
  groups. Faith is a tool to manipulate the beliver and create
  cynicism in those who do not believe.
  </p>
  <p>
   Emotion is not a tool of Cognition and is thus a tool of those
  who are Cognitive. C.G. Jung understood it best and even though
  he is out of fashion with other I.T.professors, his statement
  that "a man is controlled by his symbology, Control the symbols,
  and you control the man." has allways rung true.
  </p>
  <p>
   God is what you make it. There is even Cosmological research
  provided by the void engineers to support this in a literal sense
  instead of a figurative sense
  </p>
  <p>
   There are a few basic tenets to our Group that are the
  practical basis of our "faith"
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    Suppress that which is natural: Naturalistic faiths
    eventually lead to greater numbers of
    dreamspeaker,ecstatics,Akashics and Verbena. Naturalistic
    faiths also point up the shortcomings of the societal mores and
    political movements that we create. The practical application
    is to teach abstinence, self denial and mortification, and
    emotional and spiritual repression. also the utter slander of
    other faiths is absolutely neccessary to our work.
   </li>
   <li>
    We are the mind of God: A professor of the first church
    uses the bible the way the virtuals use a computer. to create
    reality. We are the decision makers for our flock,since there
    is no god. eventually sin and Crime will be one and the same.
    eventually we will be the sole creators of what is right in
    society. Emotion can be more important than logic in the minds
    of the flock. Emotion is much easier to manipulate than
    logic.
   </li>
   <li>
    Faith is a Double edged Sword: Our mission is two-fold. To
    create an army of believers and to create an even bigger army
    of people who can't believe in anything. Our mission is to
    control faith until we find a means of making it obsolete.
    (Doesn't make for a lot of job security,but there you go...)
    The practical end of this is the fostering of militantcy and
    hypocrisy,and again, the slandering of other faiths, in recent
    years we have found that making ourselves look ludicrous to the
    outsiders has been very useful and it allways hurts the
    celestial chorus. Coincidentaly "finding" satanic lyrics in
    records and sometimes highly publicized scandals can work
    wonders. Oftentimes we have found that we can fool Cult of
    Ecstasy mages into creating a scandal involving one of our
    puppets. Even better is when the Celestial chorus finds
    themselves in the unenviable position of trying to stop the
    Cultists. Inter-necine warfare almost allways breaks out.
   </li>
   <li>
    There is no Supernatural world: The supernatural world is
    inherently dangerous to our cause. There are no such things as
    Vampires,Werewolves,Ghosts,faeries, Demons,angels,or other
    beasties. Anyone who sees such is obviously delusional or a
    religious hysteric. the practice of Magick is expressly
    forbidden as this is more temptation to follow the "Devil"
    Those who expirience that which is outside our established norm
    are either delusional, being "tricked by satan" or in extreme
    circumstances they are "sinners". Be on the lookout for signs
    of actual faith in your parishoners. Spontaneous faith healing
    and Glossolalia. These people are individualist and egomaniacs
    and such tendencies must be crushed and crushed quickly.
   </li>
   <li>
    God wants Order: as do we all. Individualism and
    non-conformity are a form of heresy, to not accept the word of
    "god" in all things is to blaspheme.Naturally,we have stolen a
    page from the celestial Chorus's book on this. or perhaps it
    would be more accurate to say that we have re-written it,or
    mistranslated it, or perhaps decided that it wasn't exactly
    Canon, if you take my meaning....
   </li>
   <li>
    We are the First Church: There are no other churches before
    us. Just as the the Celestial Chorus decided that time before
    the birth of their nailed -up savior was unimportant and
    effectively backwards. We find that the faithfull will believe
    that all churches have sprubg from us.
   </li>
   <li>
    Do Good, But do good Efficiently: We enjoin ethical and
    moral standards on our flocks,but these standards must be
    rigorous and efficient. it is wrong to give charity to the bum
    on the street, he will not make himself better, he will only
    use it to make himself worse. it is right to give to the Church
    because it funds our purchases of real estate,guns,missionary
    work in africa and the like.
   </li>
   <li>
    Sometimes God demands Action: Whether its personal or
    politcal. A lynch mob can be directed against another
    church,pagans, and serial killers, not to mention drug addicts
    and sex fiends. we are against abortion and capital punishment.
    ( it hurts the euthanatos) we are against Unrestrained pleasure
    in all its forms( music,dancing,drugs,sex,games, and whatever
    else, these hurt the ecstasy cultist and the verbena) we are
    against religious unity on the grounds of compromising our
    doctrine ( a dig at the celestial chorus) we are against
    religious freedom that contravenes law ( we took peyote away
    from the native american church, and we have used prosecution
    in the past to bring the christian scientists and the orthodox
    jews to heel at the feet of our progenitor friends.) But yet we
    have also espoused the idea that the state is flawed and that
    at times it is necessary to break the law in the name of "god"
    . perhaps if the Church and state were no longer
    separated....
   </li>
   <li>
    Individualism is a sin of the Highest order: Individuals
    are afflicted with the sin of pride and they do not and cannot
    create order,only chaos. Only groups, led by a few, can create
    a perfect society.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>
   Methods of Operation
  </h2>
  <p>
   Often, the best way to operate is either in the shadows or out
  in plain sight. It used to be that we could operate from the
  utter safety of a Seminary. We could mold the minds of young
  theologians, form the basis of their belief, Be their mentor in
  all things and in that way gain a huge amount of indirect
  influence. Instead of one church we could have influence over
  dozens.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, this method has weaknesses. because the control is
  indirect, it is unreliable and subject to subversion from
  Tradition Philosophers. We still have our seminaries and they
  still create the basis of the philosophical beliefs that many of
  the believers hold, but we have had to work on a more direct form
  of control.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pursuit of academic work within the First Church now take a
  backseat to fieldwork. Anthropological fieldwork is similar, as
  is Missionary work. One must go among the savages...
  </p>
  <p>
   Often, a Minister goes out and starts a church. Sometimes,
  especially in the case of a Tele-evangelical ministry a puppet
  figure head is used. sometimes this is the original proposition
  and sometimes the puppet's ministry is co-opted later. We target
  the rich and the upper middle class. they allways have the most
  power,access, and infuence. We recruit like minded individuals
  and use our informal contacts as an invisible intelligence
  network. We learned this from the best. the Celestial chorus has
  been doing it for centuries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in the last couple of decades, we have found that we can
  create cults of varying strengths. This was started as an
  experiment in the 1960's due to a profound loss of belief among
  young people. It has long been known that groups can form around
  one magnetic individual. often these groups have no written text
  of belief(such as the bible) to draw on. Their only source of
  Dogma is the Guru in question. As you well know,this frees the
  Minister to create Dogma as he goes along. it is simple to use
  brainwashing techniques to convert even the casually interested
  into the most rabid of Believers. These cult seem to be our only
  inroads into religions overseas. eastern philosophy is utterly
  incomprehensible and often we have come up losers against it.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, Sung myung Moon is one of us. and the Moonies are in
  the Airports for a reason.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cults and suchlike are generally the province of those
  Ministers who are working in the midwest.
  </p>
  <p>
   Generally, the aim of a church is to become influential in the
  molding of it's surrounding community. this can be done through
  extortion,bribery,psychological tactics and in some rare cases,
  armed conflict. once the surrounding community has been
  influenced then the community can be "immunized" against threats
  to the Paradigm.

  <h2>
   Rotes
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Like seeks like: (mind 2 and/or entropy 2 and possibly time 2
  as well.)
  </h3>
  The Minister sets up a field of sympathetic
  vibration around himself or around his church. This field senses
  those people who are sympathetic to the aims of the church or
  individual in question. The field itself is the main effect.
  sometimes drawing in people that wouldn't ordinarily come into a
  church. When the field is in sympathy with an individual that
  individual will feel drawn in. sensing a "rightness" about the
  feeling. the field can also cause coincidental effects to draw
  people in such as a sudden downpour or a flat tire. the Time
  element of this rote is solely for the purpose of giving the
  minister the ability of making a flawless first impression. (
  "well I happen to be through teaching these children, so I guess
  I've got some time to talk..."
  <h3>
   And the spirit moved upon him: (Mind 2)
  </h3>
  this simple rote
  greatly magnifies the natural Oratorical abilities of the speaker
  by giving him great presence. ( often accomplished through the
  use of Subliminal signals.) Each success on the magick roll
  decreases the difficulty for any persuasion or oratory based
  skill by one.
  <h3>
   Casting bread upon the waters: (Prime 4 and sometimes Spirit
  3)
  </h3>
  While in the Sanctuary, a Minister may manipulate spirits
  and Prime freely. The proceedure entails the mage emptying his
  avatar of Quintessence and having it's power magnified and
  returned to him. for each point of Quitessence dumped in this
  manner the user may regain 3 from siphoning off the belief of his
  parishoners. Only Avatar Q can be used in this manner. Still,
  this can used as an efficient way to gather Tass. The spirit
  element of this rote should not be performed in plain sight as it
  entails apportioning tass to spirits in exchange for whatever
  information or services they can provide.
  <h3>
   The seeker's path to truth: (entropy 5)
  </h3>
  By simply
  speaking to someone the Minister may cause them to doubt
  everything they've ever been told. while this can eventually
  cause a coma (and in some rare cases elightenment) among
  sleepers, it is much more dangerous to mages as it can drive them
  into quiet or temporarily rob them of Arete. for each success on
  the magick roll subtract 1 from the target mages Arete. Powerful
  ministers can reduce other mages to sleepers, sometimes
  permanently, as the mages ability to believe in himself erodes.
  <h3>
   Negative Vibrations: (mind 3)
  </h3>
  Creates a field of psychic
  static with subliminal messages that predict failure. While this
  doesn't prevent magick,per se, It does make it nearly impossible
  to concentrate. For each success on the magick roll, a minister
  can add 1 to the difficulty of any task requiring concentration.
  this includes magick,hedge magick,thaumaturgy, and many other
  form of Magick use. Individuals with Concentration or Iron Will
  as merit can mitigate this somewhat.
  <h3>
   Nothing new under the sun:(time 2 and entropy 2)
  </h3>
  By
  pointing out a biblical or historical example, the Minister may
  Predict future events and in some ways manipulate them as well.
  <h3>
   Will no one rid me... (mind 2 or 3)
  </h3>
  Basically, this rotes
  enables a Minister to manipulate his parishoners into taking a
  desired course of action while publicly saying nothing of the
  sort. The minister must give a short sermon that might have
  something to do with the target. all the while planting
  subliminal subtext. Later, when people talk about it, they get
  the bright idea to trash the Verbena's forest all by themselves.
  <h3>
   Ultimate Authority (mind 2)
  </h3>
  Any person affected by this
  rote will find themselves seriously affected by symbols of
  Authority. A white collar,a police badge, even traffic signs will
  cause the target to obey unless they spend willpower,and make a
  willpower roll against an 8.
  <h3>
   Put your trust in god ( mind 4)
  </h3>
  Cause the target to be
  unable to consider things intellectually and thus will become
  extremely emotional. this can be modified with other effects but
  is the basis of most 1st church brainwashing.
  <h3>
   Revealation (mind 4 time 2)
  </h3>
  Often used to create a
  manchurian candidate or two, this rote causes the target to have
  a "vision" time is used to predict future events and then the
  Target is "edited" into the vision. People who have had these
  visions are unable to speak about them without a willpower check
  against a 9.
  <h2>
   The rudiments of church magick
  </h2>
  Emotional belief is a
  powerfull force not just in terms of how it affects one
  physiologically, but how it affects the brainwave patterns.
  Church magick taps into this power through the use of Logical
  dogma,extremely precise public speaking,Hypnosis,and subliminal
  broadcasting. over time as the community becomes aware of a
  minister, they become more and more acclimated to listening to
  him until he hardly has to use Technomagick at all.
  <p>
   Mind:Simply talking to people is how most Ministers get work
  done. Often technomagickal apparatus become superflous over time,
  but many young ministers are capable crowd controllers and
  hypnotists. Also there is a bewildering array of subliminal
  transmitting apparatus and implants available.
  </p>
  <p>
   Entropy: This ties into the belief factor. Since the Minister
  is an authority figure all he really has to is predict the
  success or failure of an enterprise and sleeper belief will cause
  it to come to pass.
  </p>
  <p>
   Correspondence: Most upper level correspondence effects elude
  our field of study. however we can generally plausibly use
  effects up to level 2 by observing,being well read, guessing
  right, and the occasional "vision".There have been instances when
  miraculous events were capable within the logical framework of
  our convention. there have of course been a few catholic saints
  who were able to be in two places at once.
  </p>
  <p>
   Time: again many of the upper level effects elude us without
  borrowing further technological enhancement. however a
  combination of being percieved as wise,studying history,and
  again, belief in authority can enable a minster to scry through
  time without awkward questions from the faithfull.
  </p>
  <p>
   Prime:Prime energy(percieved as spiritual enegry) can be
  quantified and manipulated in plain sight of the sleeper. This
  biochemical emotional response can be caught and distilled into
  pure tass. thanks to our friends in the progenitors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Spirit: our ace in the hole. Spirits can be used to spy,to
  influence sleepers when they are not under our direct supervision
  and they can be usefull policemen and bodyguards in the Ascencion
  war. often these Biochemical Engrams can be captured and used or
  simply bargained with as a Minister desires.
  </p>
  <p>
   Life: Faith Healing is definitely frowned upon by our study
  group. Wounds can "appear" to be worse than they are but this
  dodge cannot be pulled all the time. Often however a usefull pawn
  can be rehabilitated through a "combination of Sweat,Hard
  Work,Determination, Faith and Prayer." It is a little easier to
  laugh at the trials of an enemy who has constant problems with
  injuries and illness. ("maybe Somebody's trying to tell him
  something, brothers and sisters.")
  </p>
  <p>
   Forces: Miracles involving forces are nearly impossible to
  deny. while usefull for personal defense against supernatural
  forces they are a threat to the paradigm and should only be used
  in extremis. When a Minister is reduced to using such "miracles"
  often he has to leave whatever post he has spent so much time
  preparing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Matter: Again, as above.
