I assume you mean character quotes.  Okeydok, here goes:

"I prefer to think of them as the 'Suggestions of Motion..'"
                                    -Dr. Boson, Son of Ether

"Thank YOU, DOCTOR Korskov, for brightening up our dull lives with the 
light of a million suns!"
                                    -Cassandra, Euthanatos Mage

"Wax my Lupus!"
                                    -Tony Vincenzi, Glass Walker

"Please send in Rockets-Red-Glare.."

"Where's Bombs-Bursting-In-Air?" <sarcastically>

<pause> "On vacation in Vegas.."
                                    -Conversation with a Glass Walker  
                                     Personnel Director in Pittsburgh, PA

"Well then, why ISN'T he reincarnating?!"

<long pause> "He's just.. procrastinating?"
                                    -Cassandra, Euthanatos Mage

LAUGH!!  That one beats all of mine.

Here's a couple more from our games.  It's funny how these always seem to 
develop during perfectly serious situations..

"I think they're in love.."
                  - Peers-At-Spiders, Uktena Theurge, speaking of his 
Black Fury and Fianna Packmates during their umteenth vicious argument, 
right before they both attach him simultaneously when they overhear the 
remark.

"But Doctor, will Science be enough to defeat ALL of them?!"

"No.. we'll just beat them silly!"
                  - Peter Lowell, a young Son of Ether, speaking with a 
Former SoE Marauder (a fact which he hasn't caught onto yet) just before 
a battle with Technomancers.

"It's a Homid thing.."
                  - Spoken various times, by his packmates, to a Fianna 
Lupus with very little experience with humanity.

"Lupus thing.." 
                  - Said as a wiseass remark after a Homid Garou gets 
attacked for approaching a birthing den.

"And exactly what is THIS supposed to do?"

"It's a coffee maker.  I make coffee with it."
                  - A Hermetic Mage attempting to criticize Dr. Boson on 
his methods while touring his lab.  The "apparatus" in question is a Mr. 
Coffee.

"What's your Tradition?"

"Get them before they get me.."
                  - Bobby Brimstone, talking to an Orphan Mage NPC

"But.. he's not scared.."

"Yes he is, he's just paralyzed with fear!"

"Then why isn't he even looking at us?!"

(The subject) "Probably because I'm blind as a bat."
                  - Two Poltergiests attempting to scare a man standing 
on a street corner while Embodied.

"Oh, what are you going to do?  Tell me it'll all get better?  That 
people will miss me?  Are you going pursuade and comfort me with your 
moral convictions?"

"No.. We are going to THREATEN you."
                  - Walter Brooks, Euthanatos, talking a punk kid out of 
taking a leap off a ten story building as two allied Wraiths appear on 
either side of them.  It worked, though his reasons for doing this are 
rather complicated.

"Then what were you doing in the company of known Communist 
sympathizers?"

"Just socializing.."
                  - Bobby Brimstone, during a flashback sequence set in 
the McCarthy Era.

"I've done it!  I've created water!"

"Yeah.. so?"

"Well, nobody's used THIS method to accomplish it before!"

"Yeah.. so?"
                  - Bobby Bromstone, speaking with a rather wacky Son of 
Ether

I've really enjoyed a lot of the quotes so far... Time to share my own, I
guess, although they're pale by comparisson. Let's start with an old,
used... er, I mean recycled, yeah that's it... a recycled quote:


"Just because I'm paranoid doesn't mean they're *not* out to get me."
-Jessica, explaining to her friends why she just blew two people (later
confirmed to be technocracy goons) away with her 12 guage.

"Do plants have minds?"
"Does Chang *think* plants have minds?"
"Sure, why not? They're alive, aren't they?"
"Then plants have minds."
"Chang uses Mind 3 to read the fern's thoughts."
-Player to ST, exploring the possibilities of magic. (He did contact the
fern's mind, but couldn't understand its thoughts at all...)

"It's a Happy Lock. It likes me."
-Samantha, putting lock for which she has no key into her purse. She had
just "fed" the lock (a spirit within the lock, actually) a point of
quintessence to get it to open.

Heh, was that particular incident actually an accident (on the part of 
you, the player) or on purpose for humor value?  I used to have my (now 
deceased) character, Dr. Korskov, "accidentally" blow up lab equipment 
just for effect (and to intimidate the other characters.)

<cough cough> (still holding two electrical cables)

"Good Gaia, what on earth WAS that?"

"Uhm.. my Field Flux Transition State Modifier.."

(Acolyte) "Uh, Doctor.. the FFTSM is over there."

(looking back and forth, scratches head)

"Oh.. well no wonder it blew up.  The garbage compactor isn't rated for 
these voltages.." (looks at cables in exasperation.)
