   The Solificati
  </h1>
  <i>
   by Andrew E. Larsen
  </i>
  <p>
   The origins of alchemy date back to the dawn of human
  civilization, when primitive smiths and potters first mastered
  the art of transforming matter with fire. The earliest smiths and
  potters were regarded with the same awe granted to shamans. Even
  at this point, the art had a strong association with celestial
  phenomena, as early mages harnessed the power of meteors to forge
  some of the earliest sword talismans. Throughout Egypt,
  Mesopotamia, and China, as civilization grew, the art of alchemy
  spread, although the exact origins of that word are obscure.
  </p>
  <p>
   While many alchemists assert that the origins of the
  Solificati date to Egypt in the first millennium BC, when the
  mysterious figure Hermes Trismagistus is claimed to have
  established the basic features of the craft, the first
  historically identifiable alchemists are a group of woman active
  in Alexandria in the first few centuries AD, and some Tradition
  scholars suggest that Hermes was invented by misogynist mages
  during the early Renaissance, so they would not have to admit
  that their art was first codified by women. The greatest of these
  women, Maria the Jewess, made a permanent imprint of the practice
  of alchemy with her dictum that the four classic elements of
  earth, air, fire, and water represent the basic states of matter,
  and that physical matter is the passive reflection of the
  spiritual truths of the heavens. Yet her work was precisely
  measured and carried out with intense scrutiny and observation,
  thus showing that from its inception the craft was situated
  between the nascent Traditions and Conventions, having something
  in common with both. Its closest allies were that Tradition which
  would eventually become the Order of Hermes, and at this stage
  there was little distinction between them.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Alexandrian alchemists slowly cohered into a system of
  formalized teaching, based around the Serapion, a temple in
  Alexandria. When Theodosius I ordered the Serapion closed at the
  end of the Fourth century (under the influence of the Celestial
  Chorus, some say), many of the school's teachers fled to Arabia,
  where they continued their work, and eventually became accepted
  into Islamic culture in the Eighth century, when the great
  alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan (known in the West as Geber) opened
  his school of alchemy in Damascus. It was during the period just
  before Jabir that the craft formulated many of its chief
  characteristics. The physical matter is but a pale reflection of
  the spiritual truth, and the external appearance is a metaphor
  for the internal reality. By drawing out the internal reality,
  the exterior is transformed. The quest to transform base metals
  into gold is a metaphor for the process of Ascension, which the
  alchemist pursues by learning the spiritual lessons which his
  research offers him.
  </p>
  <p>
   While this was happening, in China, the craft was undergoing a
  parallel but distinct development. The first great Chinese
  alchemist was Li Shao-Chun (c.90 BC), a mage at the Imperial
  Court, who possessed the ability to transmute matter and to
  miraculously transport himself from place to place. His teachings
  were similar to Maria's, but he was far more interested in the
  realities of organic substances. He argued that matter grew and
  naturally changed from one substance into another. By the
  mid-Fourth century AD, the art of alchemy had developed into a
  broad system of life magic, and Ko Hung perfected an elixir of
  immortality that caused the spiritual body to shed the physical
  one like a snake sheds its skin.
  </p>
  <p>
   When Ninth century Arabic travelers encountered their Chinese
  counterparts, there was a prolonged period of conflict and
  argumentation, but by the Twelfth century, pressure from the
  incipient Technocracy on the one hand and the Celestial Chorus on
  the other led the Eastern and Western alchemists to realize that
  they in fact had a great deal in common. Toward the end of the
  century, the Chinese alchemists came under direct attack from the
  Artificers, led by Chu Hsi, a former Akashic monk who apostatized
  from the Tradition. Chu Hsi opposed all forms of Taoist
  superstition, under which category he included alchemy. Many of
  the more scientifically inclined alchemists were swayed by his
  arguments and joined him, while the more mystical among them held
  out and went into seclusion.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the West, alchemy spread with Islamic civilization and
  found its way into Europe through Spain and Sicily. Its strong
  spiritual content appealed to many monks, who saw the craft's
  emphasis on fire as a transformative principle as similar to the
  Chorus' use of fire as a manifestation of the One. It quickly
  spread to the Universities, and the Chorus desperately attempted
  to stamp it out, viewing it as a threat to the True Faith. Roger
  Bacon, who practiced and privately taught alchemy at Oxford and
  Paris, was censured by the Church in 1277. This proved the first
  shot in the Chorus' attempt to eliminate the craft, and many
  alchemists either abandoned their work or took up with the Cabal
  of Pure Reason. Those who remained found a spiritual truth in
  their suffering, arguing that they had been transformed by the
  fire of the Chorus into something stronger and more pure.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the early fifteenth century, the Solificati, as they had
  come to call themselves, were largely distinct from the Church.
  Most of them were upper class men and women, since only the
  wealthy could afford the expensive tools of their work. In
  contrast, most of the Eastern alchemists were poor hermits, who
  financed their work by transforming common substances into gold
  and silver. What they shared in common was a strong insistence
  that the material world was an allegorical guide to the spiritual
  one. The Craft as a whole had begun to meet regularly, at 20 year
  intervals, each time at a different city. At the Baghdad Session
  in 1455, Diplomate Luis, a Cordovan alchemist, argued forcefully
  that the Solificati had to join with the other Traditions, and he
  was appointed to represent them at the Grand Convocation at
  Mistridge, although many of the Eastern mages had considerable
  misgivings, given his strongly aristocratic background and
  personality. When the First Cabal was formed, the Eastern
  alchemists argued that the Solificati representative must have as
  strong an understanding of Life magics as Matter, to balance out
  the two branches of the Solificati. Heylel Teomin, a European who
  had travelled in Arabia and Asia, was chosen as the ideal
  alchemist, a person who combined male and female, rich and poor,
  Matter and Life. Heylel was seen as embodying all that was good
  about the alchemists, and under his influence, many of the
  underlying arguments about the nature of alchemy were laid
  aside.
  </p>
  <p>
   Heylel's treason in 1470 shattered the Solificati. The more
  dogmatic Eastern members felt that his corruption was due to the
  inherently flawed nature of Western alchemy, and many of them
  broke off contact with the West in disgust, while the Westerners
  argued that Heylel's biological experiment was misguided and
  corrupt. The more rationalist Solificati concluded that the
  spiritual focus of the craft was misguided, and a good number of
  them were drawn into the Technocracy, particularly the
  Progenitors and the Pupils of Parmenides. Some of those who
  joined the Pupils were among the most prominent of the Western
  alchemists, which has led some scholars to conjecture erroneously
  that the Solificati were actually the forefathers of the Sons of
  Ether. Those who remained true to the ideals of the Convocation
  were scorned by the other Traditions as suspect of treachery, and
  most of the remaining Solificati were driven out by this
  pressure. Those who decided to remain were absorbed by the Order
  of Hermes, which was sympathetic to their approach, and this
  faction has contributed much to the Order over the last few
  centuries, but they are no longer true Solificati. Under these
  various tensions, the weak organization of the Solificati
  collapsed, and despite periodic attempts to organize another
  Session, the craft has remained a collection of reclusive
  individuals who communicate with each other only
  sporadically.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next few centuries were unkind to the Solificati. A good
  number of the more prominent and gifted alchemists were won over
  to the Technocracy. Paracelsus' assumption that alchemy was the
  handmaiden of medicine served to funnel many mages into the
  Progenitors, and eventually in 1541, another Solificati, seeing
  the damage that Paracelsus was doing to the Craft, murdered him
  with a bottle of specially brewed wine that caused him to have a
  fatal accident. Copernicus' heliocentric theory proved a grave
  blow to the astrological assumptions of the alchemists, for whom
  the geocentric theory had deep spiritual ramifications. At the
  Symposium of London in 1661, the Iterator Robert Boyle convinced
  the Technocracy to destroy the Four Elements theory of matter,
  and under his influence, the English Royal Society attacked
  alchemists throughout the Eighteenth century, disproving their
  work and embarrassing them. This assault humiliated many of the
  greatest Solificati and gradually drove them to the margins of
  society, where they remain today.

  <h2>
   Philosophy
  </h2>
  Matter is that portion of the world which is
  unchanging in its true form, and therefore it is the most pure
  representation of the spiritual world, since living substances
  inevitably wither and decay, and forces are transitory. All
  matter is fundamentally one substance, and over time it evolves
  from base to pure, culminating in gold. This evolution is an
  external reflection of the hidden nature of reality. The universe
  expresses its spiritual truths in allegorical form, and by
  studying the material reality the alchemist learns the deeper
  spiritual lessons that will guide her to Ascension. Western
  alchemists speak of the attempt to turn base things to gold,
  while Eastern alchemists talk of the search for the elixir of
  immortality, but both groups understand this to allegorize the
  transformation of human nature. Both seek the Philosopher's
  Stone, which will enable them to complete their work. In many
  ways, the Solificati view themselves as the perfect Craft,
  combining the rationality of the Conventions with the
  spirituality of the Traditions, thereby uniting the opposing
  poles of magic.
  <h2>
   Style
  </h2>
  The Solificati are highly reclusive, because their
  pursuit of Ascension is an intensely individual endeavor. They
  employ a wide variety of arcane terms and devices because of the
  philosophical value they find in conceiving of their work in
  these terms. This is one of the major differences between them
  and the Order of Hermes, who employ obscurity to close out the
  undeserving, whereas for the Solificati it is necessary for true
  understanding. Western alchemists tend to be very wealthy and are
  most concerned with manipulating the world through their potions,
  while their Eastern counterparts are generally poor and ascetic,
  seeking to purify their bodies through mineral-based medicines,
  on the theory that by becoming as much like the immortal material
  world they will acquire its spiritual qualities.
  <h2>
   Organization
  </h2>
  The Solificati have no true organization,
  although there is some informal contact between them, as they
  share theories and trade results of experiments. There have been
  sporadic attempts to gather many alchemists together for another
  Session, but these inevitably founder over a variety of issues.
  To find more than two or three Solificati in one place at the
  same time is highly uncommon.
  <h2>
   Initiation
  </h2>
  Like the Order of Hermes, there is a long
  period of apprenticeship require, which much hard manual work,
  which is thought of as the first stage of purification of the
  base human nature. During this time the master speaks in obscure
  allegorical language, knowing that when the apprentice has
  pondered these matters enough, he will begin to understand them
  for himself, at which time he will Awaken.

   <a name="ROTES">
    Rotes
   </a>
  </h2>
  <h3>
   The Fire Within (Spirit 2)
  </h3>
  By observing how a subject
  acts and meditating on her demeanor, the mage can determine
  whether the subject is Awakened. One success will indicate if the
  subject has the potential to awaken, two successes will indicate
  if she is awake, while three or more will give some indication of
  how enlightened she is.
  <h3>
   Greek Fire (Forces 3 Prime 3)
  </h3>
  Invented by the Byzantine
  Alchemist Michael Aretephorus in the Seventh century under the
  patronage of Emperor Heraclius I, this rote was long a closely
  guarded treasure of Greek alchemists. The mage brews an oily
  liquid which, when ignited, will consume anything not in a
  gaseous state, apart from its own ashes. The effect draws
  quintessence from whatever is burned and uses it to continue the
  fire. Thus the fire gradually increases in size until the
  duration of the spell ends or until the fire is extinguished with
  magical aid. The only other way for the fire to abate is if the
  wind blows it back over its ashes. Because of the advent of
  Napalm, this rote is usually coincidental unless it begins
  consuming something clearly non- flammable.
  <h3>
   The Blessed Fireworks of Peace (Forces 3 or 4 Prime 2 Spirit
  2)
  </h3>
  This rote was perfected in China in the Tenth century,
  where it was used during celebration to ensure safety from the
  spirits. The dazzling explosions caused by this effect cause
  damage of varying intensity to spirits (depending on the level of
  Forces used) and also raises the gauntlet in the vicinity by one
  per success.
  <h3>
   The Delightful Fireworks of Joy (Entropy 3 Life 2)
  </h3>
  A
  frequent companion to the above rote, this spell grants those who
  are showered in the light of the display good luck for the
  duration of the effect. There are variants involving
  Correspondence 2 and Matter 2 that bless places and objects with
  good luck.
  <h3>
   Universal Solvent (Entropy 3)
  </h3>
  This liquid, carried in a
  golden bottle, will dissolve any substance apart from gold, which
  is the only substance pure enough to resist entropy. The more
  successes scored, the faster the substance will dissolve
  <h3>
   Consulting the Stars (Time 1, Entropy 2)
  </h3>
  By studying the
  heavens before undertaking an endeavor, the mage can reduce the
  difficulty of the roll by one per success, by ensuring that he is
  not using ill-aspected tools and making sure that the planets are
  favorably aligned. Frequent use of this rote, however, generally
  causes the mage to start discovering that he must wait a few days
  or weeks before he can safely attempt the task. Should he ignore
  the readings, the difficulty is increased by the number of
  successes. Wise mages therefore are cautious when using this
  rote.
  <h3>
   The Golden Petal Elixir (Entropy 1 Life 3)
  </h3>
  This
  pleasant-tasting potion identifies all abnormal weaknesses in a
  living being (including diseases and injuries) and cures them.
  With Life 4, it will correct birth defects, while the addition of
  Mind 1 will allow it to cure mental illness.
  <h3>
   Blood of the Red Dragon (Life 3 or 4)
  </h3>
  This drink, first
  brewed by the great Ko Hung, increases the drinker's strength and
  stamina by one point per success. The effects will wear off
  before the drinker begins to take pattern leakage, since the
  intent of the potion is to perfect the body, not harm it.
  <h3>
   Resurrection (Matter 2 Life 4 Prime 2 Spirit 2)
  </h3>
  This rote
  brings the dead back to life, by transforming the lifeless matter
  into living matter and recalling the spirit to its former body.
  This is a perfect example of the differing approach that the
  Eastern and Western Solificati take to the same spell. Eastern
  Alchemists will bath the body in a hot bath and feed it the
  Scarlet Snow and Flowing Pearl Elixir, while the Western
  Alchemists will reduce the body to its essential salts by burning
  it and then mix them with certain liquids to reform the person
  whole. This effect requires three successes if the person died
  recently, but four or more if she has been dead for some time.
  Insufficient successes will cause the person to die again, while
  a botch will produce a living thing that is not the person.
  <h3>
   The Essence of Venus (Life 4 Prime 2)
  </h3>
  This rote, a
  classic of the Western Solificati, produces a love potion which
  will cause the drinker to fall in love with the first person she
  sees after drinking it, by producing intense hormonal responses
  within her body.
  <h3>
   The Transforming Fire (Matter 2 or 5)
  </h3>
  A rote so common
  among the Western Solificati, most Tradition mages think it
  defines the whole purpose of alchemy. By heating a substance over
  flame of varying temperature, the mage can change it into almost
  any other substance she desires. With Matter 5, the substance
  produced can have virtually any qualities at all.
  <h3>
   Sublimation (Matter 3)
  </h3>
  By exposing an item to a brief
  burst of flame, the mage can effectively dissolve it by
  transmuting it into a gaseous state. As the gas slowly cools, it
  will gradually solidify again.
  <h3>
   Brew Elixir (Prime 3)
  </h3>
  This is one of the most fundamental
  alchemical spells, established in its basic form by Maria the
  Jewess. By concocting a potion (for Western Solificati usually a
  liquid or unguent, in the East more commonly a pill), the mage
  can imbue it with any other magical effect he can create. This
  potion, mixed from mineral elements rather than herbal ones, is
  effectively a single-use talisman, usable by anyone, including a
  Sleeper, which can be dangerous, since any Paradox acquired is
  suffered by the user. Without this rote, any Solificati potion
  will only work in the presence and by the suffrage of the mage;
  otherwise most of their potions are toxic and will cause a point
  of Health damage per level of effect the potion is intended for.
  <h3>
   The Jade-Compounded Calamity-Allaying Elixir (Matter 2 Prime
  5)
  </h3>
  By distilling expensive ingredients down to their base
  purity, the mage can create liquid Tass, one point per success.
  <h3>
   Alloy Primium (Matter 5)
  </h3>
  The Solificati claim that they
  possessed the secret of making Primium centuries before Iteration
  X did, and that in fact it was stolen from them in the Sixteenth
  century when a number of Solificati joined that Convention. They
  point to the use of gold and silver, their traditional metals, as
  proof that the substance originated with them, as well as the
  fact that they can create it in a normal crucible, while
  Iteration X requires a nuclear furnace for it. Primium armor
  gives 5 soak dice and 2 dice of countermagic. Primium-edged
  weapons cause aggravated damage to supernatural creatures.
  <h3>
   Enchanted Servitor (Matter 2 Life 5 Prime 2, sometimes Spirit
  2)
  </h3>
  Many Solificati employ this rote to create magical
  servants, frequently animated statues or golems, and sometimes
  homunculi. In its basic form, the effect brings any inanimate
  object to life and enables it to act as a servant, understanding
  simple commands. If Spirit 2 is added, the servant becomes a
  fully sentient being, and may act as a familiar. All Servants
  require a diet of Tass, however, and most are vulgar. The great
  Thirteenth century alchemist Albertus Magnus had a bronze statue
  that acted as an assistant, but it was so slow and stupid he was
  eventually forced to discipline it with a hammer.
