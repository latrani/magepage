  <hr>
   Good evening.
   <p>
    Tonight, I bring you a message of hope.
   </p>
   <p>
    In particular, I bring a message to those of you out
  there--and I know there are many of you--who smirked when I said
  "hope." I'm going to say it again. Tonight, I bring you A.
  Message. Of. HOPE.
   </p>
   <p>
    I can hear you saying, 'what is there to be hopeful for? I've
  been to dozens of these lectures, I've been out on the streets,
  I've seen the way the world is, and I know there IS NO HOPE. The
  forces of Paradox disrupt even the most basic elements of my
  paradigm. The Technocrats control the global paradigm. The
  Nephandi grow stronger by the day. Marauders spring up like weeds
  in what few cracks remain. And it only gets worse.'
   </p>
   <p>
    And I will tell you--BULLSHIT.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you look at the world and see it getting worse, you are
  being
    <i>
     conned
    </i>
    . You have to look with better eyes, and I
  mean
    <i>
     really
    </i>
    look, and
    <i>
     think
    </i>
    about what you're
  seeing. And if you do that, you'll see what I see.
   </p>
   <p>
    You'll see that while, yes, we are losing the Ascension War,
    <i>
     no one else is winning it.
    </i>
   </p>
   <p>
    I know a lot of you are wondering where I get off saying that.
  We all
    <i>
     know
    </i>
    the Technocracy is winning, after all....well,
  don't we?
   </p>
   <p>
    If you think that's true, you are being conned
    <i>
     again
    </i>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    And if you think that it's false, that the Technocracy
    <i>
     aren't
    </i>
    winning, you probably think that for the wrong
  reason. You probably think it's because we're still here to fight
  them, and that they can't win until we're all gone. Or maybe you
  think that because someone told you that we are "Destined for
  victory." I'm here to say that we're not destined. I'm not saying
  that we
    <i>
     won't
    </i>
    win, I'm not saying that we
    <i>
     can't
    </i>
    win, but I
    <i>
     am
    </i>
    saying that we're not living in a cowboy
  movie. Your hat is not white, and their hat is not black. You are
  not automatically the Good that will Conquer All Evil. And if you
  think that you
    <i>
     are
    </i>
    , you're not going to learn from the
  Technocracy. Because they know something, they do something
  better than anyone in this room does.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Technocracy didn't learn everything they needed to know
  while they were in kindergarten, but they learned the most
  important thing: to
    <i>
     share
    </i>
    . Because while all of us accept
    <i>
     intellectually
    </i>
    that Sleepers have the same innate
  potential that all of us do, the Technocracy
    <i>
     proves
    </i>
    that
  they do, and then goes even further by
    <i>
     guaranteeing
    </i>
    that
  those Sleepers can
    <i>
     use
    </i>
    that potential. Before I Awakened,
  I performed miracles on a daily basis. I used a metal box that
  moved by itself to get around town. I healed the sick. I talked
  with someone standing half a world away. I put food into a tiny
  plastic cage and it was cooked in less than five minutes.
   </p>
   <p>
    Did this require training and discipline? Yes, of course it
  did. I had to learn how to do these things, and even the
  Technocracy cannot change that aspect of our Art. But it did not
  require
    <i>
     understanding
    </i>
    . The strength of my Avatar meant
  nothing. I think that the Technocrats truly believe, or at least
  most of them do, that one day there will be no difference between
  the Awakened and the Sleepers. A dreamlike Ascension, with all
  boundaries removed.
   </p>
   <p>
    And while the standard
    <i>
     Traditional
    </i>
    response is that it
  will be one endless Nightmare, there's still something very
  admirable about what they're doing. Because they avoid the sin of
  Pride which has destroyed so many of us over the centuries.
  Because they empower the Sleepers. Because they perform a
  spectacular trick and then tell the audience how they did it, and
  they encourage the audience to go home and try it for
  themselves.
   </p>
   <p>
    We never did that.
   </p>
   <p>
    Never.
   </p>
   <p>
    And that might be why we're losing.
   </p>
   <p>
    But this is just the same doom-and-gloom message you've all
  been getting since day one. You already
    <i>
     know
    </i>
    the
  Technocracy has a better reputation with the Sleepers than any
  other faction has ever had. Except that--well, let me get back to
  this later.
   </p>
   <p>
    Because now I want to touch on the other two factions. We have
  the Nephandi, the corruptors, and we have the Marauders, the
  uncontrolled. Both represent to me the worst that can happen to
  us as we walk a thin line opposing the Technocracy. Because we
  have to preserve more possibilities than the Technocracy plan
  allows for, we run the risk of losing our tenuous grasp on
  conventional reality and becoming a Marauder. Because we face a
  vast, powerful, and dangerous foe, we run the risk of despair and
  make ourselves corruptible. These two factions will never
  actively win this War, for the simple reason that neither of them
  can convince the mass of Sleepers that their way is right. There
  is something in the human spirit that is repulsed by corruption,
  just as there is something in the human spirit that is repulsed
  by insanity. If the Nephandi or the Marauders win, it will be
  entirely
    <i>
     our
    </i>
    fault for handing them a victory they cannot
  earn for themselves. If we are not vigilant, if we do not deny
  them the raw power they need to overcome the best intentions of
  the Sleepers of this world, everything we have ever cared for
  will be lost forever.
   </p>
   <p>
    Grim, isn't it?
   </p>
   <p>
    Are you depressed yet?
   </p>
   <p>
    Don't be. I want you to
    <i>
     feel
    </i>
    how important the
  Ascension War is to you, not just as a Tradition mage, but as a
  person. Because if we lose, we want to make
    <i>
     damn
    </i>
    sure we
  don't lose to one of them. Keep that in mind when it comes time
  to make the tough decisions, because all of us are depending on
  you to do the right thing.
   </p>
   <p>
    But don't be depressed. Because I'm bringing you a message of
  hope.
   </p>
   <p>
    Hope, because while we're losing, we haven't lost yet.
   </p>
   <p>
    Hope, because while we're losing, no one else is winning.
   </p>
   <p>
    Hope, because while we're losing, I can show you that we are
    <i>
     making a difference
    </i>
    to the world, and that all our efforts
  are
    <i>
     not
    </i>
    being wasted.
   </p>
   <p>
    Let me tell you a story. It's a story about me, a nice North
  American kid who went to a nice North American school, got his
  nice straight A's, went to a nice medical school, and became a
  doctor. Because I wanted to help. Because I wanted to make a
  difference.
   </p>
   <p>
    And I did. I cured the sick. I took away pain and suffering,
  and I brought healing. I worked in a hospital for five years, and
  then I lost my faith in medical science.
   </p>
   <p>
    I lost my faith.
   </p>
   <p>
    Later, I found faith in something else. That's why I'm a
  Verbena today, and not still a doctor in a nice hospital in a
  nice North American city. But I lost my faith in medical science.
  I lost my faith in what the Technocracy had told me about how
  healing works.
   </p>
   <p>
    So let's look at the things which the Technocracy has told our
  society we should have faith in. We could pick anything, anything
  at all, and we can find a reason for hope in it. But I'm
  prejudiced, so I'm going to look at medicine.
   </p>
   <p>
    What's the thing that Joe Average on the street will tell you
  about going to the hospital, besides that the food stinks? He'll
  tell you that it's expensive as hell. He'll tell you that if
  you're not rich, you better have good insurance, or you'll be
  ruined for life. He'll tell you that if you don't have money or
  insurance, you won't even get in the door.
   </p>
   <p>
    Why is this?
   </p>
   <p>
    What
    <i>
     is
    </i>
    money, in this fine Technocratic paradigm?
   </p>
   <p>
    It's Tass. It's Quintessence. It's Ether, if you like. It's
  the stuff that makes magic work.
   </p>
   <p>
    Don't agree with me? Think about it; if you have enough money,
  you can do
    <i>
     anything
    </i>
    in this world. You can go to the
  Technocratic version of the moon and show it on
    <i>
     television
    </i>
    to an entire world. Money is important to the Sleepers, and not
  just because the Technocracy has told them it's important. They
  sense the quintessence even if they have no name to give to
  it.
   </p>
   <p>
    So if Joe Average is telling you that the cost of health care
  is incredibly high, you should know automatically what that
  means.
   </p>
   <p>
    It means that the Technocracy is losing, too.
   </p>
   <p>
    It means that on a fundamental level, the Sleepers aren't
  buying the Technocracy's crap any longer. There's Disbelief out
  there, folks. People are starting to think that maybe science
  hasn't got all the answers for them, and that means that it takes
  more money--more quintessence--for things like medical science to
  actually
    <i>
     work
    </i>
    . And the Technocracy knows that it needs
  science to actually
    <i>
     work
    </i>
    if they're going to get
    <i>
     anywhere
    </i>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    Oh, the highly indoctrinated ones are still true believers.
  You won't find a doctor or a scientist or an engineer or anyone
  like that who doesn't believe. Unless they lose their faith, of
  course. But the seething mass of Sleepers, the people who feel
  their lives are much smaller than the lives of people on TV, the
  people who know that they don't have to
    <i>
     understand
    </i>
    how the
  microwave works to be able to use it, they're the ones who are
  starting to pull away.
   </p>
   <p>
    They're the ones who are making the Technocracy lose.
   </p>
   <p>
    They're the ones who gave me the message of hope I'm giving to
  you tonight.
   </p>
   <p>
    Because if there's Disbelief out there, we need to find it. We
  need to cultivate it. We need to use it. Disbelief is what will
  make the Technocracy lose. The Sleepers are the ones who will
  defeat them. In the end, they're the only ones who
    <i>
     can
    </i>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    Now, I'm not saying that stopping a Technocratic plot, or
  removing a Technocracy Construct, or sabotaging a Technocracy
  device are worthless activities. But if that's the only front you
  fight this War on, you are ignoring the opportunity that's right
  in front of your nose.
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm not just talking about converting Sleepers to believing in
  your paradigm. I'm talking about converting yourself and joining
  the Sleepers. I'm talking about learning from what the
  Technocracy has done right, as well as from what the Technocracy
  has done wrong. It is right to pay attention to the Sleepers and
  to teach them everything you can, without the kind of jealous
  secrets those of us in the Traditions are all-too-accustomed to.
  It is right to think of the Awakened as being no better than the
  Sleepers and to
    <i>
     act on that thought
    </i>
    . But it is wrong to
  think that because you've taught them something, that they owe
  you their Belief. And it is wrong to try and force them to go
  somewhere if they don't want to go.
   </p>
   <p>
    That's my message of hope to you.
   </p>
   <p>
    That's my challenge to you.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thank you, and good night.
