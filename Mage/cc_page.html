   Celestial Chorus Paradigm

  Some parts (especially the
  descriptions of Mind, Time and Life) have been borrowed from "The
  Celestial Chorus" by Paul Strack.

   <h2>
    The Paradigm
   </h2>
   <b>
    The Song
   </b>
   : The whole of creation is
  one great Song, sung by everything that exists in praise to the
  Highest. Every event bear witness to the greatness of the One,
  although our limited understanding does not always make this
  apparent. What appears to be evil, disharmonies or errors in the
  Song are really a necessary part of the music, forming dark
  counterpoints and contrasts to the beautiful themes. We must
  strive to sing with the Song, harmonize the different voices, and
  help all of creation unite harmoniously into the glorious finale.
   <h2>
    Magick
   </h2>
   <b>
    Miracles
   </b>
   . Although the great Song follows
  its own laws, the One loves us so much that we are allowed to
  improvise ourselves, within certain restrictions. A person with
  enough faith can overcome the normal rules and perform miracles.
  Did not Jesus say "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that
  believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and
  greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my
  Father." (John 14:12)?
   <h2>
    Spheres
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <b>
      Correspondence: Omnipresence
     </b>
     . Distances are an
    illusion. Everything exists at the same point, in the total
    unity of the One who is omnipresent. In the same way we can
    perceive or become present at distant places to spread the
    faith.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Entropy: Disharmony
     </b>
     . Although most of the world is
    in almost perfect harmony, disharmonies are everywhere. When
    something is not perfectly harmonious, the disharmonies will
    slowly grow until it is destroyed. But we can heal such damage,
    or direct it at targets which should be removed for the greater
    good.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Forces: Light and Fire
     </b>
     . Light was created first of
    all creation, to uphold it and manifest the power of the One.
    The great forces of nature are reminders of the enormous power
    wielded by the Highest, and how tiny we are in comparision. But
    at the same time, they light up and warm us, showing how much
    the One loves us. Through faith and discipline we can be given
    some measure of control over these forces, to spread the faith
    and protect the faithful.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Life: Healing
     </b>
     . All life was created in the image of
    the One. As the universe is the house for the soul of the One,
    the body is the house for the soul of creatures and plants. As
    we work to heal the universe, we learn also to heal our own
    bodies, and others. Do not engage in the false creation of
    life, however. This is the domain of the One. Such poor
    creatures are at best soulless, and at worst a house for
    malignant spirits to enter.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Matter: Creation
     </b>
     . The world is the artwork of the
    great Creator. In the same way as it was created, we may
    attempt lesser creations as long as we remain humble and
    realize that our works are nothing compared to the great
    Creation.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Mind: Will
     </b>
     . Just as we bend ourselves to the will of
    the One, we may bend the will of others. Only by surrender to
    Divine Will can one increase this power, for it is truly the
    will of the One they surrender to. Do not abuse this power,
    however. Choice is the gift given to all the One's creatures,
    for only by choice may one come into grace. It is not our right
    to take it away.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Prime: The Presence
     </b>
     . This is the ultimate sphere,
    the sphere which encompasses and perfects the other spheres.
    Without the approval of the One, no miracles would be possible.
    All we do, we do on the sufferance of the One. Some traditions
    erroneously believe that they control the Essence flowing
    through the world; theirs is the sin of Pride. It is impossible
    to control the Presence, it acts with love of the One.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Spirit: The Messengers
     </b>
     . Besides mankind, there are
    other beings, many of which serve the One and act as messengers
    to us from the Highest, helping us and showing us the way
    towards harmony and unity. But there are also misled beings who
    doesn't understand their part in the Song and false messengers
    who serve the dark forces of disharmony and destruction. By
    purifying our souls we may reach into the higher worlds and
    contact the messengers, or even actually travel there. By
    keeping the wisdom and purity of the messengers in our hearts,
    we can overcome the dark forces and cast them out.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Time: Omniscience
     </b>
     . The One is all-knowing, and all
    that has happened, both past and present, lay open before it.
    In times of need, she can grant us visions of the future or
    past. Do not think that this invalidates our free will, for
    though the One knows us so well that she knows all that may
    come to pass, the choice is still ours.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h2>
    Arete
   </h2>
   <b>
    Faith
   </b>
   . All magick stem from faith. Faith in
  yourself, faith in magick and faith in the One. Some say the One
  gives the faithful greater insight as their faith grows. Others
  say faith grows as the mage understands creation more, and comes
  to realize how all-powerful and everpresent the One is. Both
  explanations are of course just rationalizations, faith itself is
  beyond logic.
   <h2>
    Quintessence
   </h2>
   <b>
    The Essence
   </b>
   . Everything that exists
  is made of the divine Essence. In order to create the world the
  Highest had to shape it out of Itself, infusing it with divine
  power. This Essence is hidden inside everything, giving it
  existence and beauty.
   <h2>
    Paradox
   </h2>
   <b>
    Doubt
   </b>
   . Doubt is all too present in the
  world today. A mage who doubts his magick will loose control over
  it, and doubting witnesses can similarly disturb the singing of
  the song. When doubt has appeared, it can often be used by dark
  forces seeking to harm the doubter or lead him astray. However,
  this is just another necessary test of our faith.
   <h2>
    Awakening
   </h2>
   <b>
    The Vision
   </b>
   . To fully come to faith, a
  person must have the Vision of the One. There is a great
  difference between believing in the Highest and actually
  experience It. Afterwards, the mage will constantly be aware of
  the Divine Presence in the world.
   <h2>
    Mage-specific Backgrounds
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <b>
      Arcane: Protection
     </b>
     . The One protects his followers,
    not through violence or cunning but through humility. A
    protected mage will be ignored, unseen, yet able to act and
    work.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Avatar: Guardian Angel
     </b>
     . Some mages are blessed with
    greater power of their Guardian Angels than other mages. They
    are in closer contact with the higher realms, and can both give
    power and wisdom to the questing mage.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Destiny: Chosen Ones
     </b>
     . These are people choosen by
    the One to sing special parts of the Song. Some will perform
    glorious deeds to introduce new themes or resolve apparent
    disharmonies. Others will sing in the background but still
    influence the course of the Song.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Dream: Gifts
     </b>
     . Sometimes the One sends visions or
    help to faithful in need, like the Gift of Tounges which was
    given to the apostles.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Node: Holy Place
     </b>
     . The One is present in everything,
    but in certain places the divine power is more evident than
    others. Such holy places serves as sanctuaries for the faithful
    and inspiration to the mystics.
