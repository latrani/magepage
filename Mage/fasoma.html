   According to the Correspondence Theory, all places
  are in fact a single place, the Correspondence Point. But what
  few mages know, is that there exist other such points,
  alternative ways of perceiving space completely alien to mankind.
  Fasoma Span is one of them, a force beyond human comprehension
  worshipped and served by demented K'llasshaa Nephandi and even
  worse beings.
   <h2>
    Fasoma Span
   </h2>
   As all Masters of Correspondence can attest
  to, the normal human perception of space is merely an convenient
  illusion erected to deal with reality a little at a time, instead
  of perceiving all of it at once. The Masters have moved beyond
  this, and are at least theoretically able to see the
  Correspondence Point itself. But what they cannot do is to sever
  the web of location; they cannot divide an object by dividing the
  space it is in. It is widely believed the Oracles of
  Correspondence can do this, and it is partially true: the Oracles
  understand how it could be done, but also the horrible risks of
  doing it. The Nephandi have no such compunctions.
   <p>
    Fasoma Span is a secondary Correspondence Point (or maybe a
  way of seeing space) that is not continuous like our space, but
  completely discontinuous; there are no straight lines or united
  objects, only disjointed parts randomly linked together. In
  Fasoma Span the distance between otherwise nearby points (such as
  the vital organs of a human) can be immense, or practically zero.
  A normal human moving through this space would suffer roughly the
  same effects as moving through a titanic meat-grinder...
   </p>
   <p>
    However, Fasoma Span is currently much weaker than the
  Correspondence Point, and most of existence follows the laws of
  the Correspondence Point instead. Only a few Nephandi and some
  bizarre spirits move through Fasoma Span. But Its worshippers
  seek to make It more powerful, to make all of reality obey the
  random laws of Fasoma Span instead of order and continuity. It is
  also served by a number of lesser beings, the Flowers of the
  Rifts, which are somewhat like even smaller correspondence points
  or complex patterns of discontinuity within Fasoma Span.
   </p>
   <h2>
    The Flowers of the Rifts
   </h2>
   <blockquote>
    "'If we can see it clearly, we are lost!' he warned, his voice
    vibrant with terror. 'Pray that it remains without form!'"
    <br>
     --From "The Space Eaters" by Frank Belknap Long
    </br>
   </blockquote>
   What makes Fasoma Span so dangerous is that it is
  not hindered by the Gauntlet - it is a way of perceiving space,
  not a being which can be locked out. The Flowers of the Rifts and
  their minions are prevented from entering the world by the
  Horizon, but they are able to influence reality slightly through
  the few people insane enough to perceive the world as they do.
  They constantly watch for such people, seeking to draw them
  closer so that they could become the conduit of the power of
  Fasoma Span.
   <p>
    Very little is known about the Flowers themselves. The Eater
  of Dimensions is believed to be one of them, although this
  bizarre predatory realm could equally well be an independent
  being. Another being, known as the Chains of Orthogonality, seems
  to be an abstract manifestation of finite geometries and their
  structure. A third, the Yg Medallion, is only described in
  Malleus Neffandorum as an "Unapproachable Aberration".
   </p>
   <p>
    One kind of beings serving the Flowers are the Space Eaters.
  These bizarre beings are apparently unable to move other than
  through
    <em>
     eating
    </em>
    the intervening spaces. They can only
  perceive the physical world dimly, but a human conscious of them
  is very apparent and immediately attracts them. When they
  manifest they are formless, but human perceptions define them
  somewhat, making them semi-tangible and might finally give them a
  form, which gives them the ability to make all who see them think
  of them. They immediately burrow into the brains of viewers both
  physically and mentally, keeping them alive but filling the
  victims with a sensation described as an acid, terrible cold and
  a brilliant light while gradually devouring them. Exactly what
  they use the brains for is unknown, maybe they feed on them,
  maybe they learn from them or maybe they just play with them.
  These beings have made intrusions into reality several times, but
  so far been driven off by mages or the Church.
   </p>
   <h2>
    The Rratcha
   </h2>
   <blockquote>
    'I've got to get out of here,' he screamed. 'The thing wants
    room. My head won't hold it. it wants the night - the vast
    night. It wants to wallow in the night.'
    <br>
     --From "The Space Eaters" by Frank Belknap Long
    </br>
   </blockquote>
   Although some Nephandi know about Fasoma Span and
  use Its Qlippothic Correspondence, It is only served by a group
  of K'llasshaa known as the Rratcha. Apparently the Flowers of the
  Rifts can become conscious of a person if he suffers from
  sufficiently severe distortions of space perception or thinking
  (typical recruits are severe psychotics or people with damage to
  both the parietal and occipital lobes of the brain). They reach
  out, and guide the perceptions of the recruit/victim into Fasoma
  Span, where he is quite literally ripped apart by the
  discontinuities. To an outside witness, the person suddenly isn't
  there, sometimes leaving a stain of blood or a limb behind. This
  is the Rebirth of the Rratcha; if the tattered pieces of the
  person can learn to shift their perceptions back and forth
  between both the Correspondence Point and Fasoma Span, he will
  become one of the K'llasshaa serving It. Otherwise the victim
  will remain inside the chaos forever, spread out to normal
  perceptions across the entire universe.
   <p>
    The Rratcha are warped even by Nephandi standards. Very little
  remains of human thinking or perceptions, just scraps of thought
  and emotion which are randomly linked together and discarded. In
  fact, they are perhaps more Marauders than Nephandi, since their
  insanity is given some direction by what remains of their
  Avatars. Their bodies are totally warped; when they don't pay
  attention completely pieces move in and out of existence, change
  places or turn into something else. When they loose control or
  become enraged, their apparent structure vanish completely and
  they become a cloud of independently moving bodily parts; parts
  belonging to other people trapped within Fasoma Span might appear
  in the mix, which constantly shifts and twists through space.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Rratcha vaguely seek to bring other beings to the same
  perceptions as they do, sometimes just by appearing, shifting in
  and out of space around the terrified victim and then leaving,
  sometimes by actually dragging somebody into Fasoma Span. The
  victims add a bit more belief in discontinuity and Fasoma Span to
  reality, and in addition the pieces of their avatars provide
  sustenance for the Flowers of the Rifts or raw material for new
  Rratcha.

   <p class="c1">
    Gnnnnn, a typical Rratcha
   </p>
   <p>
    Gnnnnn was once called Tracy Heathcliff and lived a normal
  life as a young pre-school teacher. During her drive home one
  evening, her car was hit (or rather, crushed) by a truck and she
  suffered severe brain damage, both her legs were ripped off and
  what remained of her face was horribly disfigured. Unmercifully,
  she survived. Locked into her own world of pain and paralysis she
  began to hallucinate that her legs where out there somewhere,
  slowly finding their way back to her. The hospital around her
  seemed to split into meaningless shapes all the time, moving
  apart and together like a huge jigsaw puzzle. Finally one night,
  her legs found her, and she walked out the door into the place
  beyond the puzzle. All that remained in the bed was her organs,
  which still continue to live independently today against all
  reason.
   </p>
   <p>
    Gnnnnn is the Rratcha which was mostly created from Tracy. It
  is one of the more human Rratcha, able to cohere into a passable
  human form for minutes at a time. It will then look like a young
  woman with extremely pale skin criss-crossed by thin bleeding
  cuts which sometimes open to reveal the internal labyrinth or
  drift apart her body in hypnotic patterns. Her voice is
  surprisingly deep and husky, but she cannot talk anything but
  gibberish (she suffers from aphasia) As she looses coherence her
  limbs begin to move apart from each other, hanging in the air
  without support. Then they split into a cloud of tiny globs of
  flesh and bone, whirling around and teleporting themselves across
  the room.
   </p>
   <p>
    Most of the time she appears to people (especially mages) to
  show them the immense freedom/pain/truth of being disjointed. She
  appears to them in human form, holds a short speech (which is
  complete gibberish due to her aphasia) and then disperses into a
  cloud of flesh around them, sending visions of Fasoma Span and
  finally vanishing (often leaving a nasty paradox backlash). Many
  people have become seriously unhinged by the experience, and a
  few of them have even been picked by the Flowers.

    Penetrating or slicing damage won't hurt Gnnnn

  a part of it is burned, crushed or otherwise destroyed, other
  parts will reappear to replace it (this lowers all damage with
  three levels). Otherwise like a human.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Rotes of the Rratcha and their enemies:
   </h2>
   <b>
    The Fellowship
  of Rratcha (Mind 2 Qlippothic Correspondence 2):
   </b>
   Rratcha are
  often able to find each other, or people thinking in their way.
  They simply split apart and drift until they encounter another
  mind whose perceptions match those, and then combine together
  around it.
   <p>
    <b>
     Enter/Leave Fasoma Span (Qlippothic Correspondence 3):
    </b>
    The Rratcha shifts his perceptions and body in or out of Fasoma
  Span, becoming spread out through reality or collecting together
  again.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Killing Distance (Qlippothic Correspondence 3):
    </b>
    By
  simply moving the parts of an object or a being apart, the
  Rratcha are able to damage it or even split it. This is actively
  resisted by the pattern, which makes it hard to actually remove
  the head from the shoulders of a human without much effort. The
  wounds are bizarre, like extreme stretchings or internal bleeding
  in regular patterns.
   </p>
   <p>
    [This makes damage just like a normal level 3 attack (Rratcha
  with higher levels of Correspondence do more damage).]
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Vision of Fasoma Span (Qlippothic Correspondence 3 Mind
  3):
    </b>
    The Rratcha gives someone a vision of his perception of
  the world and the entire Fasoma Span. This is both very
  distracting to the victim, and increases the chances that he will
  begin to see the world according to Fasoma Span instead of the
  normal way (which in turns makes him vulnerable to the Flowers of
  the Rifts).
   </p>
   <p>
    [If the total number of successes exceed the Willpower of the
  victim, the victim becomes able to think in the ways of Fasoma
  Span, and if a mage to use Qlippothic Correspondence. Such
  thinking, or actual use of Qlippothic Correspondence increases
  the number of successes even more, until the effect becomes
  permanent. The successes also become a penalty to all actions for
  the duration of the rote, since the victim is extremely confused.
  If the victim botches the Willpower roll, he becomes visible to
  the Flowers of the Rifts.]
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     The Sign of Banishing (Prime 4 Mind 3 Forces 2):
    </b>
    This
  rote was developed by the Celestial Chorus to banish the Eaters
  of Space, and is so far the only known way of doing it. Since the
  mage has to perceive something to affect it, the mage opens up
  himself to the Eaters if he fails.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Choristers found that the Eaters could not stand a surge
  of quintessence disrupting their developing patterns and
  strengthening the minds of humans around them. The Chorister
  draws the sign of the cross using fire against the Eater, and
  invokes the holiest of mysteries. Despite its power, the rote
  cannot save anyone who has been infested with the Eaters, such
  poor souls are already lost.
   </p>
   <p>
    [The Forces effect allows the fire to remain suspended in the
  air for a short while, which is merely a visual illusion but very
  helpful to focus the attention of witnesses towards the cross
  instead of the Eater. The Mind part fills the viewer with a sense
  of triumphant joy and holiness, and makes him briefly forget the
  shape of the Eater. The Prime part channels quintessence into the
  fire and joy, but also drains the accumulated quintessence from
  the Eater.]
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Open the Fasoma Span (Correspondence 5):
    </b>
    The Rratcha
  actually warps a part of space so that it manifests the structure
  of Fasoma Span instead of the Correspondence Point. The place
  becomes something indescribable, a blind spot to normal vision
  and Correspondence below level 5. If a viewer looks into it, he
  will only catch fleeting glimpses of places, parts of objects,
  skies, voids and people, but without any order or meaning.
  Actually entering it will tear apart anything. This rote is
  naturally extremely vulgar, and Paradox will immediately set to
  heal the wound to reality.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Swimming through Chaos (Correspondence 5 Life 3):
    </b>
    This
  rote makes it possible for the Master of Correspondence to shift
  his existence into Fasoma Span without actually being ripped
  apart; using his spheres he can give himself a personal
  continuity so that the discontinuities do not harm him. It is
  rumored that the Postulants to the Oracles of Correspondence
  train themselves through this rote, but it would appear unlikely
  that they would deliberately subject themselves to the presence
  of the Flowers of the Rifts.
