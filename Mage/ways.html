   One of the surviving chapters of "The Book of Good Deaths" by
  Shivadharmadhavi, written around 350 AD in Magadha. The other
  surviving chapters, "On the Arts of Intuition and Seeking" and
  "On the Dances of the Gods" have so far not been translated to
  English, except for fragments appearing in some editions of "The
  Ocean of Dust". Very little is known about Shivadharmadhavi
  (which is probably a pseudonym), except that he was a Euthanatos
  master close to the court, possibly related to the Gupta
  rulers.

  <h1>
   On the Ways of the Good Death
  </h1>
  Nagarya writes that there
  are eight ways of bringing the Good Death:
  <ol>
   <li>
    The way of the sharp knife
   </li>
   <li>
    The way of the animals
   </li>
   <li>
    The way of clever implements
   </li>
   <li>
    The way of crushed flesh
   </li>
   <li>
    The excellent way of suffocation
   </li>
   <li>
    The way of the plants
   </li>
   <li>
    The way of divine intervention
   </li>
   <li>
    The way of the dance of Shiva
   </li>
  </ol>
  But the Rashani school says there are five additional ways:
  <ol start="9">
   <li>
    The subtle way of touch
   </li>
   <li>
    The way of breaking and disease
   </li>
   <li>
    The way of killing by emotion (also known as Nagakama)
   </li>
   <li>
    The coarse way of touch
   </li>
   <li>
    The way of Agni
   </li>
  </ol>
  Each way is most suitable for one caste or group of people,
  for example the Rashani school suggests that the Paria are only
  to be killed with the way of breaking and disease, while sinful
  courtesans are to be killed by emotion.
  <h3>
   The Mudras
  </h3>
  In general, the Abhaya Mudra is good for
  calming participants who does not understand the truth or
  necessity of the ways. Many teachers also use the Dharmacakra
  Mudra (or the Vitaka Mudra when dealing with Buddhists) if there
  is time and opportunity to do so. The Surparaka school has always
  encouraged the teacher to remain with the participant if the
  death is planned to be slow for the entire process, praying and
  explaining the details of the doctrines; in this case the Samadhi
  Mudra, Namaskara Mudra and sometimes (if it is very painful or
  the teacher participates in the death) the Buddha-Shramana Mudra.
  <p>
   It should be noted that if a participant (especially a
  spiritual elder) makes the Bhumisparsa-mudra with sincerity, the
  teacher should consider the meaning of the teachings and either
  explain the act in detail, or wait for a sign. For does not
  knowledge dispel the uncleanness of time?
  </p>
  <h3>
   The Prayers
  </h3>
  All schools except the Haravana recognise
  that Durga is best to invoke before and after going on the ways,
  but different lands have different mantras, and at least one
  school, the one at Prahakadeda, sings her praises during the
  wandering. This makes the act harder to complete, and hence
  purer. The Haravana celebrate the goddess by performing the
  sacrifices of the Karpuradistotra hymn (cats, camels, sheep,
  buffaloes, goats and men) to dissolve the sins of the warriors
  for the entire year. Most masters recommend reciting the mantras
  and performing the sacrifices often, to lessen the weight of the
  killings, and the Haravana suggest that masters eventually invoke
  the all-cleansing, all-devouring fire of Jvalamukhi.
  <p>
   In the southern regions some schools regard the participants
  as offerings to the Wheel, and after the celebration give the
  leftovers to the fire of Shoshika Devi. In this case her mantra
  is to be recited, as can be found in the Gandharva Tantra: Aim
  Hrim Shrim namo bhagavati Matangeshvari Sarvanjavashankari Svaha.
  This destroys most obstracles to the full reincarnation, and
  cleanses the elements (upacharas). The school of Haravana claims
  that if the mantra is recited a thousand times and milk, mustard
  seed and rice burned with the body, the soul will traverse the
  Wheel fully for one great revolution.
  </p>
  <h3>
   On the Times
  </h3>
  Practically all schools teach that the Good
  Death is best bestowed at twilight or in the night, especially
  when the moon is in the sky. For this is the time when the great
  wheel descends into the night of death to be reborn at dawn, but
  also the time when most recipients are least able to resist.
  <p>
   But the Satpura school teaches that the age of the recipient
  is to be considered: a young boy or girl are to be killed at
  dawn, young men and females in the morning, family fathers and
  old women in the afternoon and the old men in the evening.
  </p>
  <p>
   The time of year depends more on the circumstances and way
  used; the ways of animals and plants requires the right season,
  the path of water requires rain and flooding, the way of the
  sharp knife is best when war. Giving the Good Death at holy days,
  especially the days holy to our Mother, is always suitable
  (although Nagarya warns against excess), and consulting with an
  astrologer can help decide the correct time to cause a
  reincarnation.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Way of the Sharp Knife
  </h2>
  This way is the simplest, and
  yet most complex way towards the Good Death. The manifold blades
  and moves each have their own use, preferred season and kind of
  victim.
  <p>
   Naturally the Way of the Sharp Knife is suitable for the
  Kschatria. According to the Haravana school, the paths of this
  way are:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Chakram
   </li>
   <li>
    Knifes
   </li>
   <li>
    Bent knifes
   </li>
   <li>
    Swords
   </li>
   <li>
    Kukhri
   </li>
   <li>
    Spears
   </li>
   <li>
    Arrows
   </li>
  </ul>
  If a simple crime is to be punished it is usually enough to
  cut off the extremity that committed it.
  <p>
   It is custom if possible to strike at the chakra where this
  incarnation has failed, especially if the failure is of a corrupt
  nature:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    All people who are overly dominated by the lustful and base
    desires of the Muladhara (groin) chakra are struck there (this
    requires some training to become sufficiently deadly. The
    Haravana masters suggests that a sword be rent with sufficient
    force between the legs so that the Kundalini is awakened and
    its uncontrolled forces break the chakra, but this properly
    belongs to the Way of Divine Intervention).
   </li>
   <li>
    Greedy and gluttonous people are struck in the Svadistthana
    (navel) chakra. This can preferably be done from behind to the
    left or right, if a merciful death is intended.
   </li>
   <li>
    People who firmly deny their true emotions and corrupt
    their leadership with ambition should be struck in the Manipura
    (solar plexus) chakra.
   </li>
   <li>
    Prideful thinkers and fools who have used their thoughts to
    serve base desires are struck in the Anahatra (heart) chakra
    (but the Haravana masters often tell their students that this
    kind of death is merciful and especially suitable for spiritual
    old men who have perfected their upper chakras; in this way
    they are not hurt if this way is used).
   </li>
   <li>
    People who have misunderstood their higher manas, are
    commonly cut in the visuddhi (larynx) chakra or beheaded. This
    is a common way to treat misled priests.
   </li>
   <li>
    People who extend their buddhi (lifeforce) to the detriment
    of others, or even drain others of their buddhi, or corrupt
    their buddhi with evil means are struck in the Ajna (pineal
    gland) chakra.
   </li>
   <li>
    Finally, those few who have corrupted their true self are
    struck in the Sahasrara chakra above the head, so their
    existence forever will be obliterated. This requires great
    knowledge and skill, and is commonly made by a Haravana
    Master.
   </li>
  </ul>
  It is common to make the Abhaya Mudra when following this
  way, although many students have argued that it is hard to do if
  the Kschatria resists strongly. But it should be remembered that
  the great goddess Durga makes this mudra in her manifestation,
  and it is thus consonant with the killing of the demonic ego.
  <h2>
   The Way of the Animals
  </h2>
  Each animal has its own path, and
  although they often cross they sometimes struggle, sometimes
  ignore each other as animals are wont to do, and sometimes mate
  to form a double animal. The master of this path has to learn
  their forms and tricks, and some of the paths require extensive
  preparation and training:
  <ul>
   <li>
    The path of the Lion
   </li>
   <li>
    The path of Unicorn
   </li>
   <li>
    The path of the Leopard
   </li>
   <li>
    The path of the Tiger
   </li>
   <li>
    The crushing path of the enraged Elephant
   </li>
   <li>
    The clever ripping of monkeys
   </li>
   <li>
    The attack of the snake
   </li>
   <li>
    The royal stare of the cobra
   </li>
   <li>
    The slow death by rats
   </li>
   <li>
    The pulling of donkeys or oxen
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   It should be noted that the schools of Bangalore let dogs bite
  and eat ghosts; but this is widely regarded as unsuitable even if
  the ghosts are themselves unclean; the best way to deal with
  ghosts and other spirits is divine intervention or the way of
  killing with emotions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Rashany school teaches that no mudras are required for
  these paths, since the animals will give suitable signs to the
  participants, but it is common practice for the teacher to make
  the Dharmacara Mudra or in the northern provinces Buddha-Shramana
  Mudra if the teacher explains the symbolism of the act if it is
  intended to be slow and painful.
  </p>
  <h3>
   The Paths of Lion, Leopard and Tiger
  </h3>
  The paths of the
  lion, leopard and tiger are all suitable for virtuous Kchatria,
  great hunters and young men.
  <h3>
   The Path of the Unicorn
  </h3>
  The path of the unicorn is
  suitable only for the spiritual old man, in the months when the
  skies are right. It is a most rare path, and often requires
  carefully selected prayers to the gods to succeed, but when the
  unicorn opens the heart of the man his soul will follow the
  spiral of the horn into the light, thus seeing the world as it
  is.
  <h3>
   The Crushing Path of the enraged Elephant
  </h3>
  The crushing
  path of the Enraged Elephant is commonly used for angry people,
  showing them the result of their actions; the Shivanalya suggest
  that a prayer to Ganesha is to be made during the ceremony. It is
  best if the participant is bound to four trees far enough apart,
  using poles in the ground has hurt the elephant.
  <h3>
   The Clever Ripping of Monkeys
  </h3>
  The clever ripping of
  monkeys is usually used for the Vaishya, since the monkeys pick
  apart in the same way as the Vaishya forge together. To make this
  path work, the monkeys have to be strengthened by prayers to the
  suitable gods.
  <h3>
   The Attack of the Snake
  </h3>
  The attack of the snake should be
  preceded by a prayer to Vasuki and the nagas, to prevent them
  from becoming angry if the victim is violent or unclean. It is
  suitable for the higher castes.
  <h3>
   The Royal Stare of the Cobra
  </h3>
  The royal stare of the cobra
  is very holy, and has in the past only been used as a path for
  the royal and high to pass to the next incarnation.
  <h3>
   The Slow Death by Rats
  </h3>
  The slow death by rats is widely
  regarded as suitable for the lower castes, although the school of
  Tosali practices it only on the Brahmins at times of celebration.
  It is one of the ceremonies best suited for fasting and long
  prayer by the teacher above the pit.
  <h3>
   The Pulling of Donkeys or Oxen
  </h3>
  The pulling of donkeys or
  oxen are very suitable for the Sudra caste, although the
  Shivanalaya suggests that all people filled with irresolute
  thoughts and emotions, people who wander without direction or are
  filled with conflict should be pulled by the donkeys while the
  teacher explains the need for unity.
  <h2>
   The Way of Clever Implements
  </h2>
  This way involves mechanical
  traps and implements of torture, although the Tiruvannamalai
  schools also place the Wheel as a path of this way.
  <p>
   Traps are suitable for dealing with seekers who seek the
  teacher, out of curiosity, hate or understanding. They are
  commonly divided into falling traps, traps that open, traps that
  strike and traps that change. They all require the skills to
  build, and some has to be built with the house (and thus stand
  under the protection of the local gods), but provide a most
  excellent mean to teach the toolmakers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The manifold arts of torture are to be described in the next
  book, but it suffices to say that pain is a cleansing emotion
  that will purify the soul; all schools agree that the student and
  teacher should seek to experience their nuances to better
  understand and use them. Sandarakani suggests that the sweet
  sounds of a flute are used for contrast during the path of
  torture, so that the pain is shown for what it is. This is also
  suitable for reciting the fifteen prayers to the Wheel.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since the implements act as new hands of the teacher, there is
  a great variety of mudras developed by their practitioners. It is
  however very suitable to make the Bhutadamara Mudra to ward off
  the dharma of the metal.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Way of Crushed Flesh
  </h2>
  This way is often regarded as
  base and material, but all agree on its efficiency, especially
  against material people. Still, the Surparaka school has found
  many profound deaths along this way for the lower castes, and all
  wise men know that the path of the wheel leads through the
  gardens of paradise where Shiva of the three worlds resides.
  <h3>
   The Path of the Falling Rock
  </h3>
  This path is simple, yet
  beautiful since the rock can be suitably consecrated. The
  Surparaka school recommends that this is used against old people,
  especially those of the higher castes. A common practice is to
  hide above a narrow pass, on a building or a ruin and wait. This
  has made this path popular among masters wishing to teach their
  students patience.
  <h3>
   The Mill of Flesh
  </h3>
  This path is very suitable for all who
  farm the earth, to show them the true tat tvam asi. It is not as
  holy as the Wheel since the millstones lie down, but is
  nevertheless both suitable and proper; some teachers claim to
  have seen the goddess Bhairaveshvari lead the farmer away after
  hi body has been milled. The Surparaka school suggests that the
  resulting blood can be mixed with flour and ash and made into
  holy bread to be consumed by the yantra fire of Jvalamukhi to
  further purify the soul.
  <h3>
   The Path of the Club
  </h3>
  Not much needs to be said about this
  path. It is related to the Way of the Sharp Knife, and thus
  suitable for the warriors.
  <h3>
   The Path to the High Cliffs
  </h3>
  This path is very suitable as
  punishment for ambitious people and as a reward to architects,
  who strive to reveal the primordial mountain of Meru in their
  temples. The ambitious men should be blindfolded and bound with
  fine ropes, and then led to the edge where the teacher invokes
  the suitable gods with their mantras and then throws the
  ambitious down, together with soma and their riches. And as they
  reach the end of their incarnation, the mantra of Remin. But the
  architect should be praised for his work, led to the highest
  tower and given incense (if possible, many teachers make upaya)
  before being thrown into the air with a great cry. And the
  Mahakali mantra is commonly read.
  <h3>
   The Grand Path of the Crushing With The Wheel
  </h3>
  This is
  regarded as one of the most beautiful ways to bring the Good
  Death, as the recipient will be able to see the Wheel during his
  or her reincarnation. It is suitable for all castes and ages,
  since the Wheel will roll over them with no regard for this
  incarnation, only the Law. The teacher should reverently make the
  Dharmacakra- mudra, and afterwards meditate on this sight,
  praising the gods for having been given the honour to witness it.
  The most perfect wheels are naturally the wagons of the gods,
  especially the wagon of Jagannatha, but the Surparaka school has
  consecrated a special wheel for this sole purpose which is daily
  covered with incense and soma.
  <h2>
   The Excellent Way of Suffocation
  </h2>
  The disciples of Rashani
  perfected this way, and to this day remain its masters and true
  guardians. Nagarya thus writes that there are only three paths on
  this way:
  <ul>
   <li>
    The path of water
   </li>
   <li>
    The path of the locked hands
   </li>
   <li>
    The paths of the Rashani rope
   </li>
  </ul>
  But the Satpura school point out that there is also a path
  of earth, wherein the victim is buried alive. This path is said
  to be good for the Brahmans.
  <h3>
   The Path of Water
  </h3>
  The path of water is commonly used, and
  often the first to be taught to the students in the lowlands. It
  is better to drown the participant in the Ganges than the
  Bramaputhra, and better to drown him or her (for Nagarya writes
  that this path is the best path for girls and women) in a holy
  river than in a lake or sea. According to Nagarya, beside
  Varanasi and the other holy cities of the river, the best place
  to choose is a calm beach where the trees give shade and the
  fishes play in the water. The Balaghat school has built a special
  dam in their temple in the mountains wherein soma, rice and
  butter are poured as the participant is held down, while the
  Kankesanturanata suggests using a net, especially for fishermen
  and tying down rich people with their belongings.
  <h3>
   The Path of Locked Hands
  </h3>
  The path of the locked hands is
  commonly taught, but hard to do well for many students. The
  teachers of the Rashani keep many secrets, but it is known that
  the grip has to be firm and remind the user of a heart. The
  Tenkasi rub their hands with the sap of a special tree, while
  Nagarya suggests rubbing them with hairy larvae from the forest
  to make them thick, hot and soft.
  <h3>
   The Paths of the Rashani Rope
  </h3>
  The Paths of the Rashani
  Rope are manifold and confusing to the uninitiated. They are
  named after each of the signs they make, for the masters are able
  to write in air using their ropes. To strangle a victim, it is
  important to have the right kind of rope. The Rashani all claim
  the ropes from the Krishna are the best, but Nagarya is told to
  have said that the ropes from Kutch are stronger. Some schools do
  not use ropes, but pieces of cloth or even plants.
  <p>
   The best way to approach is from behind, but masters have
  strangled from all directions, even hanging from a branch above
  (these masters then jump down on the other side, hanging the
  victim neatly). The victim is said to not be aware of the attack
  before it is too late, but will doubtless struggle, so the
  Rashani first train their apprentices in the subtle and coarse
  ways of touch.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since both hands are used, no mudras are made in this path or
  the path of locked hands, but the Rashani teach that the act
  itself forms a secret mudra meaning "No life, no death".
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Way of the Plants
  </h2>
  This way is most often used against
  the Vaishya and Kchatria nobles. The masters find it suitable
  both for young men and women, but suggest that older men should
  be taught using other ways.
  <p>
   It has been argued that a true traveller on the Way of the
  Good Death should not attempt to follow the way of plants when
  the recipient is a paria eating meat, or when dead animals are to
  be changed. But the Rashani masters have said that compassion is
  the highest of virtues, and that the uncleanness of the blood is
  banished by the devotion to Kali. For does not her name mean "She
  who devours Kala (Time) and returns to her formlessness"?
  </p>
  <p>
   Sometimes the Varada Mudra is made when following this way,
  although many students prefer to make the mudra after the gift
  has been bestowed.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nagarya divides this into five paths, but many masters refer
  to other paths:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    The Deadly Essence
   </li>
   <li>
    The Trickery of the Food
   </li>
   <li>
    The Weighted Possessions
   </li>
   <li>
    The Dark Bride
   </li>
   <li>
    The Unusual Fruits of the Valleys
   </li>
   <li>
    The Path of the Spiked Demons
   </li>
   <li>
    The Garden of Kali
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
   The Deadly Essence
  </h3>
  This is the simplest path. An extract
  of the bright flowers of the Huna province is prepared with
  butter, and then given to the victim in his food, as massage or
  thrown with a length of rope. Many schools know other mixtures to
  use.
  <h3>
   The Trickery of the Food
  </h3>
  Many students of the way of
  plants use this path, since it is simple to learn and often is
  the best when the victim is not intended to know who sent the
  gift. By participating in the cooking of the food, either poison
  (like the Huna essence or the venom of snakes, in the case of
  Brahmins) or decay can be hidden beneath the lovely tastes,
  killing or sickening the eater.
  <h3>
   The Weighted Possessions
  </h3>
  A more subtle path, where the
  possessions of the victim are poisoned by smearing them with the
  essences of powerful plants. A beautiful variation is to curse
  the things, so that greedy people will be struck while virtuous
  people will remain safe; Nagarya once created at sceptre that led
  the greedy kill each other, thus giving the good karma of the
  Good Death to them as a gift.
  <h3>
   The Dark Bride
  </h3>
  This way was found by Nisimguri of Tosali
  as he sought to end the reign of prince Kaulajnana. He gave a
  beautiful girl to drink the ten cups of the dark plant, praying
  to the Goddess to strengthen her body and fill her with the
  bhairava force of the waning moon. Nisimguri then sent the girl
  to the prince, who was delighted by her beauty and scent. And as
  he kissed her in the palace garden, he fell down dead.
  <h3>
   The Unusual Fruits of the Valleys
  </h3>
  These fruits of the
  valleys of the Anamalai hills have many wondrous properties. They
  are dark, like rotten grapes, but smell of sandalwood and hide
  beneath leaves like outstretched hands. Ingesting these fruits
  gives the eater vivid sights that are more real than the real
  world, and often horrendous as they reveal his sins and fears,
  thus they are sacred to Tenyam Devi, she who reveals the fault.
  The eater can be approached and admonished properly, often
  realising his guilt to the extent that he voluntarily accepts the
  Good Death. And this way is often used against liars of any
  caste, or sinful monkeys.
  <h3>
   The Path of the Spiked Demons
  </h3>
  This path is secret, only
  taught by the masters of Honavar. It involves the spiked demons
  of the sea, who will willingly reveal the whereabouts of potent
  poisons growing in the undersea gardens. These poisons are
  powerful and unknown to all but the Honavar mixers.
  <h3>
   The Garden of Kali
  </h3>
  This is a classic preparation, often
  used for especially worthy or dangerous opponents. Lotus flowers
  are gathered, and their petals placed on the altar of Kali. The
  master of plants then smokes hashish and enters the sleep of
  visions, to visit the garden of Kali, beyond the mountains of
  Ganareva. In the garden, he will pray to the Goddess for guidance
  using the three high mantras, asking her to provide him with a
  drop of the blood from the dead anti-gods in the name of the
  eternal beauty of her Dakshinakali yantra. And if the master of
  plants is found to be worthy, the Goddess will appear digambaram
  and let a drop fall from her mouth. After the rite, one of the
  lotus petals will have darkened. Give this to the opponent, and
  the deadly delights of the garden of Kali will be his.
  <h2>
   The Way of Divine Intervention
  </h2>
  This is the way of power.
  This way involves Good Death brought by unnatural or holy means,
  and should not be undertaken lightly. Misusing this path means
  that the gods themselves may wish to bestow the gift of the Good
  Death to you.
  <p>
   This path is the only suitable path for the Good Death of gods
  whose time has come. Only by a god may a god be worshipped, and
  only by a god may a god be killed.
  </p>
  <h3>
   The Slow Path of Diseases
  </h3>
  This path is in common use, and
  requires little comment. Creating fevers, boils and watering of
  the blood requires the master of sickness to invoke the demons of
  unhealth into the victim, while praying for the Goddess to let
  them stay in the house of the body due to the crimes and needs of
  the victim.
  <p>
   One variation, linked to the Way of Animals is the disease of
  moving flesh, where the spirits of maggots are invoked to breed
  inside the victim. This is a suitable way of dealing with the
  casteless, especially those who have committed grave crimes.
  </p>
  <p>
   This path is useful if the teacher wishes to teach and
  enlighten the victim before the reincarnation. Often it is used
  for old but unenlightened people.
  </p>
  <h3>
   The Path of Petitioning Dharmaraja
  </h3>
  This path is suitable
  when no other means seems to work. The god of death is petitioned
  by a prayer to the south and drawing his yantra to judge between
  the victim and petitioner; one will die, one will live. Many who
  fear they will have to use this uncertain path make rich upayas
  to Dharmaraja before visiting the victim, but victims have been
  known to counter-pray. Still, it is a most extraordinary way to
  bring the Good Death, and masters still speak of those who have
  undertaken it.
  <h3>
   The Ineffable Trident of Vishnu
  </h3>
  This great weapon is
  filled with the power of the great god Vishnu, and served Durga
  well when she defeated the anti-gods. Killing with the trident is
  only to be undertaken as the highest honour to the victim, a
  king, a great guru or a god as it is not the hand of the holy
  warrior that holds the trident, but Vishnu himself. Commonly the
  entire temple gathers before the killing to fill the trident with
  holy power, making it a weapon of tremendous ability and
  manifesting the forces of eternal creation. This makes it useful
  to ward off demons, unclean spirits and other denizens of the
  base, since they do not dare to approach the warrior carrying the
  trident.
  <h3>
   The Flashing Path of Indra
  </h3>
  By praying to Indra the great
  god may send his lightening to the aid of the follower of this
  path. The cleansing and powerful fire is an excellent way of
  disposing of demons and other harmful beings, but also to purify
  the violent and haughty. Large amounts of soma should be poured
  onto the holy fire to honour the god after this kind of miracle.
  <h3>
   Opening the Mouth of Jvalamukhi
  </h3>
  This path is rare, but
  has been used with great effect by the Rashani in their battles
  with the Haneddhi (who confuse it with the Way of Agni). By
  reciting the vidyas of Jvalamukhi, knower of all Shastras, and
  lightening a fire the Goddess of the matted locks will come to
  their aid. She has been known to set fire to enemies, make
  weapons burn like torches, make the earth open and spew forth
  cleansing fire and even let a river of heavenly fire pour down
  onto the unnamed dark city.
  <p>
   According to the Brihad Jabala Upanishad the ash left behind
  has wondrous properties, being able to heal any disease and
  cleanse the unworthy. Nagarya has proclaimed that this most holy
  path cleanses all sins and impurities, and should be undertaken
  by those who know their karma has been darkened with too many
  deeds.

  <h3>
   The Summoning of Durga
  </h3>
  This summoning is one of the
  deepest secrets of the Consanguinity of Eternal Joy, but a mighty
  one. The master may invoke the Goddess and take her shape,
  becoming her temporary avatar in times of need. This is only to
  be undertaken when the forces of evil congregate to strike
  against the pure, or when an exceptional Good Death has to be
  undertaken. If the Goddess becomes angered at the worshipper,
  nothing will stand in her way.
  <h2>
   The way of the dance of Shiva
  </h2>
  This way can only be
  followed by the great god himself, or possibly by those of his
  followers who become his avatars in the final days. Of its nature
  it is not lawful to speak.
  <p>
   This concludes the chapter about the paths to the Good
  Death.
