   I have thought about whether Paradox produces "unnatural effects"
  (like mages seeing in darkness, electricity flowing backwards,
  etc.) or not. On one hand, Paradox is a breach of the tapestry of
  reality, and when it heals the result can be chaotic and strange.
  But it might also be a force restoring order to reality, and work
  only inside it. My current idea is that paradox on lower levels
  is completely mental and internal to the mage, but when it
  becomes too great, physical changes ensue.
   <p>
    In the spirit of this, I have designed a few Paradox spirits,
  which do their dirty work using coincidental magick. Hope they
  can be useful:
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Alias:
    </b>
    This paradox spirit will look like a loved one
  or something the mage owns and cares for, like a pet or a
  important tome. It will discreetly appear in a pressed situation,
  and when the mage mistakes it for the real thing, consequences
  ensue. Sometimes it appears as a friend in dire need, and lure
  the mage into a dangerous situation.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Impossibility (Correspondence):
    </b>
    This spirit will
  manifest as a visual contradiction, like an impossible figure in
  the air or something far away obscuring nearby objects for the
  mage. It is a purely visual hallucination or an illusion. It will
  appear at an inopportune moment and try to get the attention of
  the mage when he really needs to concentrate, or perhaps make him
  slip or lose his orientation.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Live Wires (Forces):
    </b>
    This spirit will wait until the
  mage touches an electric device. Suddenly the device goes on, and
  the mage is electrocuted. The spirit can create electric
  discharges using forces and control any electric or electronic
  device.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Supervisor (Prime):
    </b>
    Supervisor follows the mage as a
  ripple in the Prime, looking for any use of magick. When it
  happens, Supervisor observes it. It can be regarded as a sleeper
  for purposes of paradox.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Squealer (Spirit):
    </b>
    Squealer follows the mage around,
  and will notify all supernatural beings of the presence of the
  mage. Quite quickly the mage will have an entourage of "little
  nasties", and even normal people will notice him. Sneaking up on
  people will be impossible, since they feel something at the nape
  of their neck and turn around.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Glitch (Matter):
    </b>
    Glitch is a small paradox spirit which
  is immensely irritating. It will use Matter to dissolve parts of
  mechanisms or make them change size slightly. A watch will stop,
  brakes will fail, a hard drive will crash when it is absolutely
  essential for the mage that it works.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Dream (Mind):
    </b>
    The spirit will wait until the mage is
  asleep, and then trap the mind of the mage in a dream realm. From
  the outside the mage will seem to be soundly asleep, but he
  doesn't wake up when disturbed. The spirit, which may look like
  anything in its realm, keeps the mage imprisoned until he dies.
  The only way to wake up is for the mage to escape, or for
  somebody else to free him from the realm.
