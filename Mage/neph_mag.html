    Seal of the Void (Prime 5, Relevant Sphere 5):
   </b>
   This is one
  of the few symbols both the Traditions, Umbrood and Nephandi all
  respect. They have to. It is a symbol, which will seal a pact or
  an oath with an unbreakable seal. This is literal, the Seal
   <em>
    cannot
   </em>
   be broken by anything. There are rumors that
  Oracles have tried, with disastrous consequences. Essentially,
  when integrated into something, the Seal will bind it into
  reality with an infinite force. Attempts at breaking the Seal
  will cause paradox, and will not succeed. Why the Seal works is
  unknown, and what it signifies. According to the Nephandi, who
  are rumored to know the most about it, it is the symbol of the
  perfect Void which underlies all things. If something is written
  in the Void, it is unerasable and can never be changed.
   <p>
    Writing the seal is quite simple, but requires an intense
  concentration as the mage pours quintessence into it. The Seal
  seems to suck it up like a black hole, and etches itself (and
  whatever it is connected to) into reality. The shape must be
  approximately correct (it's not very complicated), and can be
  written, drawn in the air or even imagined by a clear-headed
  mage. The physical representation may be damaged, but the Seal
  itself seems to reside somewhere else. Some mages have tried
  integrating the Seal into their magick to create permanent
  effects, but the resulting disasters have made many Masters to
  outlaw such experiments in their domains.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Technomancers don't know and understand the Seal, and
  would regard it as mystical mumbo jumbo. The Marauders rage
  against its unchangeability and try to deface it whenever they
  can. Order of Hermes and the Nephandi have studied it at length
  (many traditions regard it as Nephandi magick, and punish those
  who use it). Especially the Nephandi have used it as a horrible
  punishment for offenders or failing Barabbi: they write an Pact
  which is impossible to fulfil (like counting all sand in the
  ocean before midnight), make the victim sign it and then seal it
  with the Seal of the Void. When the victim fails, he is destroyed
  by Paradox.
   </p>
   <p>
    Note that the Seal cannot add anything to reality, it can only
  cause things to
    <em>
     not
    </em>
    happen and punish deviations from a
  pact with Paradox. Since it can create extremely nasty logical
  paradoxes which arouse some of the most hideous paradox beings
  unimaginable, those who know it use it with extreme caution. It
  has especially been used by the Nephandi to sign their pacts to
  their Lords.

    <b>
     The Sign of Koth (Spirit 4):
    </b>
    This sign is placed on
  doors and openings to seal them from umbrood beings. When drawn,
  the mage must infuse it with Tass to connect it to Koth, whoever
  or whatever that is. Most Umbrood, even many of the most powerful
  respect it since they fear the power of Koth. However, there is a
  catch: If the door is opened, it lets the beings in and out. And
  there is the added danger and fear of whatever Koth is, and what
  happens when the mage contacts it. The Nephandi knows, but they
  don't tell anybody...
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     The Brand of Evil (Spirit 4):
    </b>
    This sign is used by the
  Nephandi to brand people that has angered them. It is a violent,
  radical rune which is drawn in the air against them, painted on
  objects which are given to them or actually branded into their
  skins. It makes all Umbrood to recognize that the bearer has
  angered the Forces from Beyond, and most beings either try to
  make his life as miserable as possible, or avoid him. The taint
  of the Nephandi can be felt around him, and it is rumored that if
  the Avatar is branded, it will be sucked out into the Outside
  after the bearer's death...
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Sign of Protection (Spirit 4):
    </b>
    This sign is the
  opposite of the Brand of Evil, it shows that the bearer is under
  the protection of the Forces from Beyond. Anybody harming him
  risks retribution from Them. Most beings simply avoid the bearer,
  and some may become hostile. The strength of the protection
  depends upon the strength of the powers invoked by the drawer,
  and if they are willing to give their protection. However, it is
  hard to tell if a sign is backed up or not, so bluffing is
  possible.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Rune of Ownership (Spirit 4 Matter/Life 4):
    </b>
    This
  spiritual sign is drawn on an item (or being), which will be
  marked forever as a possession of the mage. This will work as
  long as the mage doesn't sell, give away or free the marked. To
  mark something, the mage must own and control it at least for the
  moment. Even Avatars can be marked in such a way if the person in
  question truly agrees about his servitude with the marker for a
  moment. This is the way many Nephandi collect Avatars for their
  masters (who may have the ownership of their souls...). It is
  also used by some normal mages to mark their possessions, and in
  old times many mages marked their possessions before their death
  to be able to bring them with them into the Underworld.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Rite of Transmutation (Spirit 4):
    </b>
    This rote is
  fortunately uncommon, but it allows Powers from Beyond to enter
  the normal world on a large but subtle scale. When performed, the
  presence of the Things become stronger around the mage, and will
  start to influence reality. Normally this is an coincidental
  effect, as living beings develop rare and surreal diseases,
  plants mutate, animals and humans are born malformed and the
  normal flow of events turn subtly strange. An area such affected
  will over time become more and more eerie, and if done slowly and
  carefully, the Nephandi can transmute the region more and more
  without undue paradox. In the end such an region will become a
  warped nightmare, where plants and animals have become hideous
  and surreal creatures, where the normal laws of physics have
  become warped and the gauntlet weakened. Such blights can grow in
  secret, and when they have become large enough their influence
  will start spreading of its own volition.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Rite of Null (Spirit 5 Correspondence 2):
    </b>
    This infamous
  rite is performed at certain occasions by Nephandi mages who want
  to gain deeper insight into the Void. The participants dance
  around a pool of shadow, and the mage finally dances into the
  darkness. When performed, the mage immerses himself into the
  total Void which underlies all things and sees beyond. This
  experience invariably drives sleepers insane, and most mages
  become more or less unhinged by what they see or surmise of the
  truth.
