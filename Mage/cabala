Subject: Qabala, Alchemy, and Mage: The Ascension

I was looking at a book on Alchemy one day and I noticed that the symbols
for the operations in Alchemy were the same as the symbols for the Spheres
in Mage: The Ascension.  This is what I came up with:

                        Supernal or Divine Triangle

Qabala          Meaning         Tradition               Sphere          Alchemy

Kether          Crown           Celestial Chorus        Prime           Essence
Chokmah         Wisdom          Akashic Brotherhood     Mind            To solve
Binah           Understanding   Dreamspeakers           Spirit          Fumes

                        Ethical Triangle

Chesed          Mercy           Verbena                 Life            To
compose
Geburah         Strength        Order of Hermes         Forces          To boil
Tiphareth       Beauty          Sons of Ether           Matter
Amalgamation

                        Astral Triangle

Netzach         Victory         Virtual Adepts          Correspondence
Amalgation
Hod             Splendor        Cult of Ecstasy         Time            Powder
Yesod           Foundation      Euthanatos              Entropy         To rot

                        Sephira influenced by all Three Triangles

Malkuth         Kingdom         Hollow Ones(?)          Unity(?)
Annealing(?)

Anyone else come with with something?  Just to start a thread...  :)
