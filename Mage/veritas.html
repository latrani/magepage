  Note: the Avatar sphere (to be found in
  B. J. Zanzibar's) is used along with this talisman.
  <p>
   This obscure talisman is said to be
  older than history, having gone through many shapes and assumed
  the current one in the Dark Ages. Only the wisest Hermetic magi
  have heard of it, and its power has been whispered troughout the
  centuries. Perhaps it was written by a Hermetic mage gone
  Marauder, or perhaps the book was the cause of him going Marauder
  in the first place. The truth may never be known.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Librum Veritas (the Book of Truth) is a
  hardcover manuscript of about 2000 pages, written in classical
  Latin, 2' long and 1 1/2' wide. It keeps all of the truth in the
  world, in the form of written word. This information is highly
  disturbing, but can also be a powerful tool for enlightening,
  sometimes even proportionating instant Awakenings and Epiphanies.
  One must have the Knowledges Occult 5 and Linguistics 3 to read
  it, but otherwise a non-mage can read it too.
   <br>
   </br>
  </p>
  <h3>
   Instant Insanity (coincidental)
  </h3>
  In
  game terms, the book takes (10-Occult) weeks to read. Every week,
  the reader must roll her Willpower against the book's Arete.
  Check the results with the chart below.

   <h3>
    Protection Against Magick (usually
  coincidental)
   </h3>
   The book has level 5 innate
  countermagick against Prime, Forces, Entropy and Matter. It can
  hardly be destroyed by magick, and its Quintessence is not
  absorbable or useable as Tass. This power is coincidental unless
  the Effect itself affected something else that turned it into a
  vulgar Effect, in which case the book's invulnerability makes it
  vulgar as well (e.g., a Forces 5 nuclear explosion in the whole
  city that left the Librum untouched).
   <br>
    <h3>
     Matter Shield (usually vulgar)
    </h3>
    The
  book is also nigh-undestroyable through natural means - i.e., no
  material forms of destruction work on it. The same guidelines as
  for
    <b>
     Protection Against Magick
    </b>
    above.

     <h2>
      Plot Uses
     </h2>
     Below are some uses for the Book of Truth in
  your chronicle.
     <ul>
      <li>
       <b>
        The Usual:
       </b>
       a powerful and corrupted mage of the
    Order wants the Book, but it's currently in the Chantry's
    library. I'm pretty sure all of you know where this
    leads...
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        The Quest:
       </b>
       now the cabal wants the Librum (or maybe
    they've been assigned to rescue it). It's in possession of an
    evil supernatural threat (or even of the Arcanum).
      </li>
      <li>
       Anything else?: I'm out of ideas. If you send me some, I'll
    write them into an eventual update.
