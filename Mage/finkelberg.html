   Die Finkelberg Werke

  <h2>
   Introduction:
  </h2>
  Europe is blessed with many powerful
  Tradition chantries,
  <a href="http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~nv91-asa/Mage/lux.html">
   Lux
  Aeterna
  </a>
  ,
  <a href="http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~nv91-asa/Mage/convivo.html">
   Convivo
  Holmiensis
  </a>
  , the Temple of the Burning Light, Doissetep.
  Despite their power, they have often changed profoundly during
  their existence, adapting to new eras instead of adapting them.
  The Finkelberg Werke are a complete exception - they have
  steadfastly refused to change despite wars, the pogrom, the
  coming of the 20th century and the hardening of reality. They
  still hold their original course, regardless of what the
  Technocracy and Traditions think.
  <p>
   The Werke is more or less a family business, run by
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#UNCLE">
    granduncle Wilhelm Finkelberg
   </a>
   with a firm grip. The
  Finkelbergs think and act as somewhat eccentric aristocrats or an
  industrialist family like the far more famous Rotschilds; they
  see the Werke as their world, and completely refuse to yield to
  the outside world. The Werke has survived several wars, bombings,
  communist agitation, the split from the Technocracy, the European
  Common Market and schisms in the family. It appears almost
  indestructible, like a good piece of German steel. But the price
  has also been high.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Physical Description:
  </h2>
  The Werke are located in the heart
  of the Ruhr, a few kilometres east of Hagen. They are surrounded
  by a classic industrial landscape; the old coal mines and the
  modern concrete steelworks, the new chemical plants and
  factories, smog, old church-steeples and highways. From the
  outside, the Finkelberg Werke look almost quaint where they
  nestle in the foothills of the mountains south of the Ruhr river;
  a four meters high spiked black iron fence surrounds an imposing
  iron gate with the rusty motto "
  <i>
   Sieg durch industrie
  </i>
  ".
  Standing at the gates, the fence seems to stretch forever in both
  directions, the Werke occupy a significant area (at least in
  theory; due to its arcane nature property rights and geodesy are
  a bit indeterminate here).
  <p>
   Behind the gates lies a straight road up to the family
  mansion, surrounded by a double row of elms fighting against
  pollution - amazingly the trees still struggle on without giving
  up despite Dutch elm disease and smog. The mansion at first
  appear to be a boxlike building, but with closer inspection it
  turns out to have numerous additions and wings stretching back
  into the area. These additions are in a variety of styles, from
  neo-classicism to brick buildings indistinguishable from the
  surrounding factories. In fact, just as the Werke are unmappable
  (although cousin
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#SIGISMUND">
    Sigismund
   </a>
   is working on the definitive map and organisation
  chart) the mansion is a confusing mass of connected buildings and
  labyrinthine hallways. The interior is still furnished with a
  mixture of 19th century styles, ranging from elegant to the
  industrial. The dining room, where the family sometimes
  congregates is a huge ballroom with a single long table under the
  brilliant crystal chandeliers (each member has his or her place
  along the table). The main study, where
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#THOMAS">
    Thomas
   </a>
   pores over some old book, is a sombre place dominated
  by dark bookshelves and busts of Goethe, Schiller and mixed
  German philosophers (including Bismarck, the great idol of
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#UNCLE">
    granduncle Wilhelm
   </a>
   ). Some galleries end in doors leading
  straight onto the factory floor. Only parts of the buildings are
  electrified, the rest are lit by gas or etherite phlogistone
  lamps.
  </p>
  <p>
   To the left of the mansion lies the chapel, a small building
  in flaking marble. It was originally built by
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#HEINRICH1">
    Heinrich Finkelberg Sr.
   </a>
   , one of the more eccentric family
  members, in 1860. It is an adequate, if somewhat dilapidated,
  holy place that is practically never used by the headstrong and
  scientific family members. Just outside lies the family crypt,
  where all dead Finkelbergs lie; at funerals or other ceremonies
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#UNCLE">
    granduncle Wilhelm
   </a>
   usually leads the ceremony after the last
  priest quit some decades ago.
  </p>
  <p>
   To the right of the mansion, hidden by some hedges forming a
  (failed) attempt to grow a maze lies the small village of
  Speyburg. The village was simply included when the Finkelberg
  Werke bought the land, and now lies completely inside the area.
  All inhabitants work for the family or in the various factories
  and has done so for generations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Werke themselves stretch back as far as one can see
  through the mists and coal smoke: brick buildings darkened by
  soot, connected with railroad tracks and concrete walkways,
  chimneys pouring out black smoke, warehouses and workshops. The
  farther into the Werke one moves, the stranger the buildings
  become. Many are ruined or in various states of repair since the
  allied bombings in the first and second world wars. The family
  strip-mine has hollowed out the ground beneath many of the
  factories so that they are perilously held up by iron supports;
  at least one building has been destroyed in a landslide. There is
  a huge locomotive shed containing obsolete steam engines quietly
  rusting away (bought by the Werke when they were decommissioned
  by the German railways; they are mainly used for spare parts),
  and the silent remains of the chemical plants used to extract
  substitute oil from shale during the war. There doesn't seem to
  be any end of the Werke, just more and more industries, mostly
  abandoned. The railroad tracks are used to export the produced
  goods through the secondary gates around the Werke, although
  several of them do not lead to any known destination.
  </p>
  <h2>
   History:
  </h2>
  The Werke were founded in 1850, by
  <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#FREDERICK">
   Frederick Finkelberg
  </a>
  , an experienced Son of Ether engineer
  originally from WÃ¼rtzburg. Its main product was steel, and
  it preceded much of the steel industry in Ruhr by a decade. When
  Krupp established himself in Essen
  <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#FREDERICK">
   Frederick
  </a>
  was selling his special steel and machine parts to
  him. During the next decades the Werke grew steadily, becoming a
  major chantry for the Sons of Ether in Ruhr. Their main
  competition was from the major Technocracy constructs in Essen,
  Dortmund and Duissburg which they remained on friendly, if
  competitive, terms with. It was already a Finkelberg-dominated
  venture, and many of the other Sons of Ether either gave up and
  left when they found the family impossible to deal with, or
  married into it.
  <p>
   After dealing with his deranged brother
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#HEINRICH1">
    Heinrich
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#UNCLE">
    granduncle Wilhelm
   </a>
   began to become the family head instead of
  his brother
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#FREDERICK">
    Frederick
   </a>
   , who more and more spent his time developing new
  and bizarre steel manufacturing processes.
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#UNCLE">
    Granduncle Wilhelm
   </a>
   eventually replaced the ageing
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#FREDERICK">
    Frederick
   </a>
   (who died of a stroke in 1872) and began to
  concentrate on heavy machinery, like steam engines and turbines
  instead of steel (which the Technocracy was far superior in
  producing). The remaining steel production is directed towards
  more or less unusual alloys and applications, like monocrystaline
  turbine blades or vanadium steel for machining tools. The
  French-German war gave the Werke a chance to demonstrate their
  new know-how, and
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#UNCLE">
    granduncle Wilhelm
   </a>
   received several medals for his industrial
  work.
  </p>
  <p>
   The First World War was a boon for the Werke, despite its
  ending. While the pre-war period had been a golden era for the
  family,
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#UNCLE">
    granduncle Wilhelm
   </a>
   had become worried that the Technocracy
  was turning away from them. But the war led to a tremendous
  expansion of Iteration X and German war industry, and the Werke
  expanded with it. They produced cannons, substitute oil and
  engines, and gained access to several extra nodes the Technocracy
  gave to them. There was some damage from allied bombings from
  zeppelins, but it was minor compared to the growth of the
  Werke.
  </p>
  <p>
   Quite naturally there was no love lost between the Finkelbergs
  and the French etherites, who both blamed each other for having
  contributed to making the war inhumane and unfair. The general
  disappointment with how the Technocracy had run the war and the
  evolution of science led to the defection of the etherites, but
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#UNCLE">
    granduncle Wilhelm
   </a>
   didn't participate in the infamous 1917
  symposium. He explained his position officially in a letter to
  the Berlin chantry as
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   "
   <i>
    The Finkelberg Werke has never taken orders from anybody;
    neither the technocracy, neither the etheric scientists - and
    we will never do that. We follow our own path, guided by the
    principles of Dynamic Science and German Industry.
   </i>
   "
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   The French occupation of the Ruhr in 1923 brought the conflict
  into the open. The Finkelbergs saw the French troops and
  technomancers as hopeless incompetents, as evidenced by the
  frequent breakdowns and problems that appeared during their reign
  (they of course blamed German sabotage). As a delegation of
  French etherites led by Dr. Maurice Philippe de Vitry (one of the
  leaders of the etherite defection and one of the old enemies of
  the Finkelbergs on the Paradigma editorial board) approached and
  suggested that the Finkelbergs help them doing sabotages against
  the Technocracy in the region with the cover of the widespread
  trouble, the Finkelbergs flatly refused and threatened to reveal
  their plot to the Technocracy.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the chaotic twenties and thirties the Werke prospered,
  and it is clear that the renaissance of the German etherites was
  closely linked with the Werke. Many of the most powerful and
  influential etherites, including the legendary Dr. Nachtstahl and
  professor Raeder visited the Werke and used its workshops and
  skilled engineers to build their famous (or, in the case of
  Nachtstahl, infamous) machines. The engineering school started by
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#WILFRED1">
    Wilfred
   </a>
   at the Werke became one of the major centres for
  applied etheric science. At the same time the Werke enjoyed great
  trust from the Technocracy (as Oscar Krupp, chief controller of
  Ruhr put it: "
   <i>
    The Finkelbergs are like a compass, always
  pointing towards Ruhr and what is good for it
   </i>
   ").
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#UNCLE">
    Granduncle Wilhelm
   </a>
   was planning for the final victory of
  German industry as the second world war started.
  </p>
  <p>
   Things went completely wrong, and the Werke was severely hit
  by allied bombings (which
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#UNCLE">
    granduncle Wilhelm
   </a>
   still claim were directed by his old
  adversary Dr. de Vitry from France). But the hardest blow was the
  deaths of Wolfgang, the only son of granduncle Wilhelm, and his
  wife Victoria. Victoria was killed in one of the allied bombings
  of the Werke, while Wolfgang who had enrolled in the German army
  and had risen to the rank of major was killed during the last
  desperate defence at Rhen in 1945, shortly before Ruhr was
  surrounded and forced to capitulate. The death of his family
  devastated Wilhelm, who was unable to resist as the hated Dr. de
  Vitry appeared in Ruhr with the allied occupation. For a while it
  looked like the end of the Werke, as the allied discussed to
  completely wipe out the German war industry.
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#WILFRED1">
    Wilfred
   </a>
   , who had complex and not entirely clean ties to the
  nazis suggested that the family should flee with him, but they
  refused and
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#WILFRED1">
    Wilfred
   </a>
   vanished.
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#ERICH">
    Erich
   </a>
   , the son of Wolfgang, heavily critiqued
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#UNCLE">
    granduncle Wilhelm
   </a>
   for both his nationalism and current
  inactivity, and eventually moved to the United States with his
  family and other German Sons of Ether.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yet again the Technocracy saved the Werke, albeit not
  directly. As the New World Order set up the Cold War, they gave
  the Syndicate and Iteration X free reign in Germany to rebuild
  it. The Werke gradually recovered as
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#UNCLE">
    granduncle Wilhelm
   </a>
   recovered from his grief, and began to
  realise that German industry would yet rise again. Although it
  was clear that the Finkelberg Werke would never regain their
  former glory, they were restored and resumed production. Over
  time the wounds have healed (or as often in the Finkelberg
  family, been hidden and suppressed), especially since the
  spectacular death of Dr de Vitry in 1964. The Werke has returned
  to their true self, although the increasing statism of the new
  Ruhr district has forced them farther and farther from
  reality.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Finances:
  </h2>
  The Werke do not accept the Syndicate paradigm
  at all, and thus still function despite all economic logic which
  they deliberately ignore. The finances of the Werke are utterly
  incomprehensible, and involve ancient trust funds, stocks in
  other industries, bookkeeping from the nineteenth century and a
  great deal of imagination. Its no wonder that the clerks and
  administrators of the Werke keep to themselves.
  <p>
   Surprisingly, the Werke actually manages to export products to
  the real world. The main export is turbine blades, turbines and
  turbine parts; all very specialised and quite efficient (if
  somewhat dated, but as
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#UNCLE">
    granduncle Wilhelm
   </a>
   points out, a good turbine design is
  ageless). Especially the turbine blades are excellent, and widely
  used. Another major export is paperclips and wire. Beside these
  main exports the Werke also produce small amounts of high-tech
  steel, steam engines and machines ordered by other etherites. One
  of the most famous products is the Hyperspeed Steam Engines used
  in the cloudships of Horizon.
  </p>
  <p>
   But most of the production is not exported into the physical
  world. Instead trains loaded with engine parts or turbines leave
  the area through the
   <i>
    other
   </i>
   gates, that do not correspond
  to any railways in Ruhr. Exactly where they go is unknown, but it
  obviously helps the finances.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Magickal Aspects:
  </h2>
  The Werke lie partially in a horizon
  realm, partially in the real world. The border is impossible to
  detect, but it is clear that they are much larger on the inside
  than on the outside. As reality outside hardens, the Werke more
  and more becomes a horizon realm. They are surrounded by a quite
  strong level of Arcane, making it hard for people to remember
  them. The Paradigm is not unlike the paradigm of the late
  nineteenth century: technology can solve any problem, social
  classes are absolute and anything can be explained by inspired
  science.
  <p>
   The main node is the strip-mine, where raw quintessence is
  harvested and used in the powerplant, fuelling the realm. It is
  also linked to several smaller nodes in the vicinity, including
  some caves in the hills around the Werke where water erosion has
  created small waterfalls; the Finkelbergs have placed turbines
  there to get Quintessence. Another important node lies in the old
  Krupp Werke, a conduit of Quintessence the Technocracy has all
  but forgotten since the pre-war days of collaboration.
  </p>
  <p>
   The entire place is often in collective Quiet, as the smog
  thickens and the sound of the factories grow into a technical
  symphony. Some periods it is very hard to tell what is real or
  not, and past and present blur together; ghosts become visible
  and the buildings seem to be filled with inexplicable
  activity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Time is a bit strange at the Werke. The time of day is
  carefully regulated through the clocks that exist on every wall;
  each hour is marked by a chorus of steam whistles and the signals
  at the start and end of the workday are almost deafening. But
  other than that, time seems to flow very loosely; some people age
  more than others, the seasons seem to shift depending on the
  general mood and it is always hard to tell what year it is. In
  the same way ageing seems to be optional; some people like
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#UNCLE">
    granduncle Wilhelm
   </a>
   and
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#MIKAELA">
    aunt Mikaela
   </a>
   do not age perceptibly, while others grow up
  quickly.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Resonance:
  </h2>
  Obsession is a strong force in the Werke.
  Everyone, from
  <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#UNCLE">
   granduncle Wilhelm
  </a>
  to the lowest servant, tend to become
  obsessed with his or her work, be it important or trivial. Some
  people remain rather normal, while others become complete
  fanatics. Being idle is not an option, everyone will sooner or
  latter find the right thing to do.
  <h2>
   Some Family Members
  </h2>
  <h3>
   <a name="UNCLE">
    Granduncle Wilhelm
  Finkelberg
   </a>
  </h3>
  Granduncle Wilhelm Finkelberg is the leader of
  the clan. Nobody would dream of opposing him, he is a steamroller
  that will stop at nothing. He has an almost religious faith in
  German industry, the Werke and himself, and absolutely refuses to
  believe that change is necessary.
  <p>
   It should be noted that very few family members remember who
  he is granduncle to, but everybody refers to him as granduncle.
  He was the brother of
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#FREDERICK">
    Frederick
   </a>
   the founder (and the deranged
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#HEINRICH1">
    Heinrich Sr.
   </a>
   ), and remembers all of the history of the Werke.
  He
   <i>
    is
   </i>
   the history of the Werke.
  </p>
  <p>
   Physically, he is an old but impressive man. Almost two meters
  tall, with a still powerful physique. In his face an old scar
  from the duels of his youth is visible on his left cheek, but it
  has been partially obliterated by more recent scars from scalding
  on steam (he has scars just about everywhere from accidents and
  heroic rescues of victims of them). He is partially bald but
  retains some wild locks of white hair around the head. He dresses
  in an old- fashioned sharkskin suit, usually walking with an
  ebony stick (he has a slight limp from an accident in 1890) and
  an elegant monocle that often reflects light into the eyes of the
  person he speaks to.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wilhelm is obsessed with the idea of steam, and is the
  greatest expert on the mysteries of very high pressures of his
  tradition. He has developed several extremely powerful steam
  engines, using physical properties of steel and steam nobody else
  has dared to explore (for good reasons; he has nearly been killed
  in big explosions over a dozen times). He has invented the steam
  cannon, which projects a beam of supersonic superheated steam
  with devastating effects, although after the death of Wolfgang he
  solemnly wowed never to build another weapon of war (but the
  family still retains some of the old artillery pieces used for
  air defence from WW I and II as a security measure). His current
  goal is to perfect a way to store energy in the hydrogen-oxygen
  plasma that develops when steam is heated to sufficiently high
  temperatures.
  </p>
  <p>
   His laboratory is a large factory complex surrounding an
  obsolete steelworks that rises like a black volcano at the centre
  of the Werke; the factory buildings are always surrounded by
  smoke and steam as Wilhelm and his workers struggle with new
  designs. Several of the buildings have been ruined by explosions
  only to be rebuilt again, and many are reinforced on the inside
  with armour.

   Frederick

  and sister of
  <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#MIKAELA">
   Mikaela
  </a>
  ) is a sensitive old lady who prefers to keep to
  herself in her greenhouse (built just outside the mansion,
  between two unused warehouses). There she tends her exotic
  plants, talks to them, listens to their ideas and jots them down
  in her small red notebooks. She is visibly nervous when dealing
  with people, and sometimes gets hysterical breakdowns when forced
  into an uncomfortable social situation. Most of the time the only
  thing the family sees of her are her notebooks (which she gets
  terribly upset if anybody reads) and the jars of mediocre
  marmalade she leaves in the kitchen (but nobody dares to complain
  about the marmalade).

   granduncle Wilhelm
  </a>
  , a reasonable old lady who is almost as
  stubborn as him. She seldom concerns herself with the running of
  the Werke, but she will not tolerate anybody interfering with how
  her family works. She is the one who intercedes in quarrels,
  teaches the children and plays match-maker. Some of the younger
  relatives see her as a born meddler, but that is only half the
  truth; she sees the family as her personal machine to take care
  of and upgrade if necessary. She has a doctorate in applied
  chemistry, and often makes experiments in her laboratory with new
  chemical processes for enhancing the properties of alloys or
  composites. She was the mother of Eva and
  <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#WILFRED1">
   Wilfred
  </a>
  in her marriage to Erik von Rahm, and Otto and
  Rudolph Sr. in her marriage to Karl Lotz (both prominent
  etherites at the turn of the century).
  <h3>
   <a name="SIGISMUND">
    Cousin Sigismund

   </a>
  </h3>
  Cousin Sigismund Finkelberg is a brisk young
  engineer who has undertaken the Herculean task of mapping the
  industries and buildings of the Werke, to create an unified
  picture of what is done where and why, to make the processes more
  efficient. So far he has succeeded in tracking the building
  history up to the French-German war, but there are plenty of
  buildings that even he admits he cannot trace. He is beginning to
  realise that much of the Werke may rather be the results of
  collective Quiet and belief than actual building. Still, that
  does not hinder his work.

  Grandfather Marcus Finkelberg (the son of
  <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#FREDERICK">
   Frederick Finkelberg
  </a>
  ) is an old man responsible for the
  making of metal wire and paperclips, one of the main exports of
  the Werke. Rightfully, he should be the director of the Werke,
  but
  <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#UNCLE">
   granduncle Wilhelm
  </a>
  circumvented him when
  <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#FREDERICK">
   Frederick
  </a>
  became too eccentric to lead and the timid Marcus
  never opposed him. Marcus does an impeccable job, but his main
  interest is spiritism. He often conducts seances with his
  equipment (a system of radios linked to a forest of wire antennas
  hanging from the ceiling of his laboratory) to listen in to the
  conversations of the dead, which he loves to relate to listeners
  (including the advice from his dead wife Astrid and
  <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#FREDERICK">
   Frederick
  </a>
  , who always seems to be nagging
  <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#UNCLE">
   granduncle Wilhelm
  </a>
  about how he is running the Werke). He is
  currently planning to produce ectoplasm in industrial quantities
  using steam and Tass held in a strong electromagnetic field and
  subjected to spiritual emanations from his antennas.

  </a>
  , is an American Daughter of Ether who arrived at the
  Werke in the 60's. At first she was greeted with a bit of
  suspicion, but she turned out to be a capable hydrodynamicist and
  utterly obsessed with turbines, and eventually married into the
  family (her husband, Hans, died in a mining accident a few years
  back). She is almost never found outside her workshop, where she
  tests new designs of turbine blades.

  history and philosophy rather than deal with the noisy Werke or
  the eccentrics of his family. He withdraws to the studies and
  libraries, where he reads and works on his own unfinished (and
  un-started) book about the history of the Ruhr and its links to
  medieval mining. He actually gets along with strangers, as long

  production of turbines, which he handles well, but his real quest
  in life is to develop the concept further. Alone in the family he
  actually thinks electricity is more than a passing fad, and
  experiments with magnetohydrodynamic turbines, generators,

  a sensible, efficient girl of 16 who runs the main powerplant and
  the production of coal (she learned it from her mother, who in
  turn learned it from her mother; they all regarded this as a
  matriarchal task). She is usually found carrying a hardhat,
  directing the foremen or poring over gauges, frantically plotting
  energy outputs, heat levels and coal production to plan for the
  future. Unlike her big brother
  <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#RUDOLPH">
   Rudolph
  </a>
  , she is an arch-conservative and often ridicules his
  attempts to improve the Werke with electricity.

    Cousin Joerg Finkelberg

  </h3>
  Cousin Joerg
  Finkelberg is the control expert of the family. Even as a small
  child he was fascinated by the regulators of steam engines, and
  as he grew up he made several improvements. He went to the
  university in Dortmund for a few years in the 50's, until
  returning even more fascinated by the science of cybernetics. He
  has since then developed ever more elaborate control systems for
  the regulation of everything; energy production, water
  consumption, railway traffic and organisation. He tends to prefer
  mechanical devices, often borrowed from the plans made by the
  <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#UNKNOWN">
   Unknown Man
  </a>
  . Recently he has become more and more obsessed
  with the growing disturbances in time in the Werke, and has taken
  upon himself to update the clocks and perhaps build some kind of
  regulator for time itself.

  is one of the few family members who cares much for
  the Ascension War, although his solution is (as expected) rather
  bizarre. He thinks that the way to make technology humane is to
  make it widespread, accessible and fun, so he manufactures
  steam-powered pencil sharpeners (looks like an ordinary tabletop
  steam engine, but drives a pencil sharpener. The removed wood and
  graphite are used to power it further), mechanical executive
  toys, window- placed windmills and other devices somewhere
  between toys and DIY industry. Some of his products actually sell
  well, and he is always trying to explain his ideas to anyone who
  cares to listen (he and his grandfather, both equally big
  talkers, often spend hours talking at each other without
  listening).

  <h3>
   <a name="HEINRICH1">
    Heinrich Finkelberg Sr.
   </a>
  </h3>
  Heinrich
  Finkelberg Sr. was the brother of
  <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#FREDERICK">
   Frederick
  </a>
  and one of the most eccentric family members, and
  most relatives prefer to avoid talking about him. He was married
  over eight times, and each time the young wife died (Valentina,
  his first wife, just died of tuberculosis, but the others died in
  more unusual and suspicious ways such as railway accidents, food
  poisonings and by falling from girders onto the factory floor).
  Eventually, the family became so suspicious that they confronted
  him, and he admitted that he had been "slightly involved" in
  their deaths. He explained that since the family crypt was so
  new, it was almost empty, and a great family like the Finkelberg
  family needed a large, well-populated family crypt, which he
  tried to provide.
  <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#UNCLE">
   Granduncle Wilhelm
  </a>
  had Heinrich locked up in one wing of the
  mansion, where he lived until his death thirty years later. He
  left behind him piles of religious poetry, which has been
  archived in a small, seldom used library. He had a son,
  <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#HEINRICH2">
   Heinrich Jr.
  </a>
  with Valentina.
  <h3>
   <a name="HEINRICH2">
    Heinrich Finkelberg Jr.
   </a>
  </h3>
  Heinrich
  Finkelberg Jr. (the son of
  <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#HEINRICH1">
   Heinrich Sr.
  </a>
  ) was the family's self-appointed demolition
  expert, helping out in creating the strip- mine with his own
  explosives. He was a little bit too enthusiastic, and despite
  having lost his right arm, eye and left foot he continued with
  his experiments. Finally they caught up with him, and he was
  blown into pieces by an unstable charge (some of the more morbid
  Finkelbergs still joke that not all of him has come down yet).
  <h3>
   <a name="WILFRED1">
    Wilfred Finkelberg
   </a>
  </h3>
  Wilfred
  Finkelberg (the son of
  <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#MIKAELA">
   Mikaela
  </a>
  with Erich von Rahm) was one of the brightest and
  most promising family members. He was the driving force behind
  the foundation of the Finkelberg Engineering School, which
  attracted many of the best minds of Germany in the twenties and
  thirties. By all accounts he was unusually outgoing and creative,
  and inseparable from Wolfgang. During the third Reich he became
  more and more involved in large and secretive engineering
  projects for the nazis, and at the end of the war he disappeared.
  Few Finkelbergs mention him, and the ruins of the Engineering
  School still remain in a remote corner of the Werke.
  <h3>
   <a name="WOLFGANG">
    Major Wolfgang Finkelberg
   </a>
  </h3>
  Major
  Wolfgang Finkelberg was the only son of Wilhelm and Victoria, and
  was generally seen as the future leader of the family empire.
  Together with
  <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#WILFRED1">
   Wilfred
  </a>
  he implemented the grand visions of Wilhelm, but had
  a more nationalistic bent; while his father believed in German
  industry, Wolfgang believed in Germany itself. As he joined the
  army
  <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#WILFRED1">
   Wilfred
  </a>
  took over his duties at the Werke (with considerable
  success) and Wolfgang began a legendary career that ended with
  his death in 1945.
  <h3>
   <a name="UNKNOWN">
    The Unknown Man
   </a>
  </h3>
  The Unknown Man is
  one of the greatest mysteries of the Finkelberg Werke. He was
  found in a large study by some workers in 1956, apparently an old
  man dead of a heart attack. But nobody knew who he was, despite
  the fact that he seemed to have been using the study for years
  (huge stacks of paper with meticulous drawings of elaborate
  clockwork devices surrounded him) and some of his personal
  possessions implied that he was a Finkelberg.
  <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#UNCLE">
   Granduncle Wilhelm
  </a>
  decided that the should be buried in the
  family crypt, even if nobody knew him. To this day nobody knows
  if he was a master of arcane, a victim of severe paradox or a
  hobgoblin from collective Quiet.
  <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#JOERG">
   Cousin Joerg
  </a>
  has become fascinated with his drawings, and
  tries to use them in his own designs.
  <h3>
   <a name="ERICH">
    Erich Finkelberg
   </a>
  </h3>
  Erich Finkelberg,
  the son of Wolfgang, moved to the United States shortly after the
  war together with his family and other sons of ether. He changed
  his name to Eric and settled in Miami, where he began to study
  oceanography and the mysteries of the Bermuda Triangle. He
  recently died under mysterious circumstances, leaving his son
  Carl an orphan.
  <h2>
   Other inhabitants:
  </h2>
  The Werke are quite populous with
  servants, workers, foremen, miners, assistants, engineers and
  other people. Most of them live in Speyburg or barracks that lie
  in the Werke proper. Most have worked for the Finkelbergs for
  generations and are fiercely loyal to them despite their
  eccentricities. Others are parts of the magick of the Werke and
  have no independent existence, or even represent hobgoblins, but
  it is very hard to tell them apart. All are busy and involved in
  some work (although often it is hard to tell what is being done
  and why). They have developed their own jargon and dialect making
  them somewhat hard to understand by outsiders.
  <p>
   Most of the workers have some kind of lung problems, and
  tuberculosis isn't unknown despite well-meaning attempts by the
  Finkelbergs to improve the environment. Strangely, many of the
  inhabitants of the Werke get worse if they leave them and improve
  as they move back.
  </p>
  <h3>
   The Kobolds
  </h3>
  These irritating beings sometime cause
  mischief with the machinery of the Werke. Usually, they are quiet
  and impossible to find, but sometimes they start to play pranks
  until driven back into the mines and tunnels below the Werke.
  During periods when the kobolds appear, nothing goes as planned
  and work across the Werke are delayed as steam engines break
  down, trains crash and documents get lost.
  <h3>
   <a name="TIEF">
    Der Tiefmann
   </a>
  </h3>
  The Tiefmann may have
  started as a tale to scare children, but he seems to haunt the
  Werke for real. According to the stories he lives in the deepest
  wells and shafts, and emerge in the night to hunt down children
  and people on the nightshift, from which he sucks blood and
  steals small things like newspapers, toys and tools. He is hidden
  in a grimy black trenchcoat and a thick layer of soot from the
  polluted underground water; his eyes glow red and the black face
  is horribly deformed.
  <p>
   According to one story he was a thief who stole the
  church-silver from the KÃ¶lner Dome and gambled it away; as a
  punishment God cursed him so that he would never be allowed to
  see the sun again until he returned the silver to the church. So
  to this day he hides underground, digging for silver and
  gathering everything of value he can find. According to another
  story, which is never told when a Finkelberg is present, the
  Tiefmann is really
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#WILFRED1">
    Wilfred Finkelberg
   </a>
   who didn't escape to South America with
  the Nazis but instead hid in the deepest pits of the Werke.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Relations to other chantries:
  </h2>
  The Finkelberg Werke are
  famous among Sons of Ether, although the opinions about them are
  mixed. Many etherites regard them as stuffy and too
  nationalistic, especially the French etherites. There is a
  long-standing grudge between the etherite chantry of Paris and
  the Werke, dating back to the French-German war when the Werke
  openly supported the Germans and fuelled by the vitriolic
  struggles between
  <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#UNCLE">
   granduncle Wilhelm
  </a>
  and Dr. de Vitry. Still, when it comes to
  steam technology the Finkelbergs are unsurpassed, and etherites
  regularly arrive to study here.
  <p>
   The Technocracy knows about the Werke but does very little.
  There are several reasons for this. One reason is that destroying
  the Werke would probably be more work than it is worth; no doubt
  the Finkelbergs would resist fanatically, unleashing everything
  they got against an attacker - inside the Ruhr valley! And the
  Werke are not doing any real damage to the static paradigm, since
  they have become so utterly isolationist and loosely tied to the
  normal world. Some Iteration X materials scientists complain
  about their alloys and turbines, but there are also highly placed
  technomancers who remember the good old days when the Werke was a
  part of the Technocracy. They remark that the Werke never split
  off from the Technocracy, it was the reverse.
  </p>
  <p>
   Most other traditions know or care very little for the Werke,
  despite their power. Ostensibly, all other traditions are
  welcome, but few stay for long. The nature oriented traditions
  soon get depressed by the lack of ordinary plantlife or nature in
  the region, the Celestial Chorus found the inhabitants to be too
  practical and materialistic, the Virtual Adepts laughed
  "steampunk" when they saw the Werke and moved on. A few hermetic
  mages have stayed longer, studying in the library together with
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#THOMAS">
    Thomas
   </a>
   , but that is all.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Story Ideas:
  </h2>
  Bringing the PCs to the Werke can be done in
  many ways. The Werke are still one of the major etherite
  chantries of Europe, and many etherites visit to study heavy
  industry and the history of their tradition. Others visit to
  order machines for their chantries, like guaranteed
  non-technocratic steam-ether dual generators. Another way to
  bring the PCs to the Werke would be a diplomatic mission, where
  some neutral etherites seek to bring the German and French
  etherites closer together. One interesting possibility would be
  to have a PC fall in love with a Finkelberg, and be invited to
  meet the family - something he or she will never forget!
  <p>
   The death of
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#ERICH">
    Eric
   </a>
   in Miami has left Carl an orphan. The PCs might
  encounter the serious child mage and decide to bring him to his
  relatives.
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#UNCLE">
    Granduncle Wilhelm
   </a>
   will be both delighted to meet his
  great-grandson and enraged in hearing about the death of his
  grandson. The PCs will be dragged along, whether they want it or
  not, as Wilhelm charges out to seek revenge. And how will the
  America-born Carl handle the Finkelberg Werke?
  </p>
  <p>
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#MARCUS">
    Grandfather Marcus
   </a>
   builds his ectoplasm generator, and starts
  to format ectoplasm using the spiritual emanations his antenna
  receives. The result is a way for wraiths and other inhabitants
  of the Shadowlands to manifest semi-physically in the world.
  While Marcus is away, eagerly explaining his invention to anybody
  who cares to listen, beings start to escape into the Werke. What
  to do when there are spectres physically present? Will
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#HEINRICH1">

   try to avenge himself on
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#UNCLE">

   , or just fill out the family crypt with
  anybody he can find? And what about the ghosts of dead
  machines?
  </p>
  <p>
   The Heart of Darkness: the Werke has for a long time exported
  paperclips through the E gate, which nobody knows where it leads.
  It is a profitable activity, but each time
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#UNCLE">
    granduncle Wilhelm
   </a>
   sends someone to investigate, that person
  is never seen again - and the import becomes more profitable.
  What is out there? Why are the trade representatives
  disappearing?
  </p>
  <p>
   There are acts of sabotage at the Werke! Someone of something
  is interfering with the train schedules to cause wrecks, and
  several high-pressure devices have exploded mysteriously. Who or
  what is behind it? It could be the kobolds, French etherites
  (
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#UNCLE">
    granduncle
  Wilhelm's
   </a>
   theory), a marauder, Russian anarchists or
  something completely different.
  </p>
  <p>
   <a href="Mage/finkelberg.html#UNCLE">
    Granduncle Wilhelm

   is on the warpath: a technocracy plot to
  re-develop the Ruhr walley into a more "clean" and "eco-friendly"

  It is time for the family and their allies to once and for all
  show them who is running the show! But who
   <i>

   strongest?
  Can the PCs prevent Wilhelm from walking straight into a trap,

  <h2>
   Mood:
  </h2>
  The theme of the Finkelberg Werke is industrial
  history and life. Every machine, every factory has a long history
  the workers can tell; many of the largest steam-engines are
  affectionately named, and the ancient gas-network is filled with
  quirks due to decades of repair and rebuilding. At the Werke,
  industry is a living force, almost a part of the family.
  <p>
   That does not mean the factories and machines are nice and
  friendly, quite the opposite. Most of the Werke belong to another
  era of industry, an era where worker safety and protecting the
  environment were unknown. More than one family member has been
  killed in accidents, and the air is often hard to breathe. Still,
  the Werke, the workers and the Finkelbergs cannot survive without
  each other, they form a perfect industrial symbiosis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Just as all living things can heal, so does the Werke heal all
  devastation to themselves. And all living beings have their
  primal urges, in this case the urge to produce, to develop, to
  serve. This reflects in the Finkelbergs, who despite their
  frailties and quirks are idealists who sincerely believe in
  making the world better, even if their perspective of the world
  mainly consists of the Werke, Ruhr and Germany.
