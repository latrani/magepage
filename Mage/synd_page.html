   <h2>
    The Paradigm
   </h2>
   <b>
    The Market
   </b>
   . The Market encompasses
  everything, even things others regard as outside economics. The
  laws of nature are built upon the transactions between different
  forces and the flows of capital (energy) between processes.
  Everything that exists exists because it is economical in some
  sense for it to do, and anything which is not efficient enough
  will sooner or later be out-competed from reality. In this way
  the Market stabilises itself and moves towards perfection. It is
  our duty to guide the economic forces to avoid sudden changes or
  undesirable developments, eventually to move the economy towards
  optimality.
   <h2>
    Magick
   </h2>
   <b>
    Business
   </b>
   . By understanding the rules of the
  Market and with a keen feeling of its behaviour, it is possible
  for us to use it for our own (and others) profit, or to subtly
  manipulate it to become more optimal. The rules are fairly loose,
  but they can be very unforgiving if you mess things up. In
  general the Market works best when nobody interferes at all, but
  sometimes changes may be necessary.
   <h2>
    Spheres
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <b>
      Correspondence: Transport and Communications
     </b>
     . The
    Market ties everything together, and wherever there is a profit
    to be made people will get there regardless of where it is. The
    stronger the economy, the closer things are brought
    together.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Entropy: Fluctuations
     </b>
     . It is an unfortunate fact
    that the Market currently isnpt totally stable, and often
    fluctuate in unpredictable manners. At the same time its a
    great way to make profits. By understanding the subtle patterns
    underlying market-fluctuations, a shrewd businessman can
    exploit them to his purposes.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Forces: Power
     </b>
     . Energy is required to produce goods,
    to transport them and to use them. This makes it a most
    valuable resource, which can be sold at high prices to those
    loyal to you and withheld from your enemies.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Life: Health
     </b>
     . The Market naturally influences the
    health of all living beings. They can become stressed or calmed
    in response to its movements, it can nourish them or starve
    them, and its effects can both kill them and give them life.
    Just like everything else living organisms are miniature
    markets, where different organs supply and consume various
    chemicals, sometimes in competition, sometimes co-operatively.
    By applying your knowledge of the laws of the Market, this
    internal market can easily be altered.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Matter: Goods
     </b>
     . Goods are produced and sold, and
    this drives much of the Market. If there is a market for a
    commodity, then it will surely come into existence. Almost
    anything can appear if the Market demands it. On the other
    hand, if the demands change the goods have to change too, or be
    out-competed.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Mind: Manipulation
     </b>
     . It is of vital importance for
    the businessman to learn how to read the behaviour of others,
    and how to manipulate them if it is needed. The first step is
    of course to learn how to control yourself, never revealing
    your inner thoughts and weaknesses. Later you may learn how to
    manipulate others through body language, speech, subliminals
    and advertising.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Prime: Economy
     </b>
     . Economy is the study of the Market
    and the application of this knowledge. By understanding the
    Market we can understand practically all of existence, and by
    controlling it we can control everything. Although the
    movements of money are the most visible form of the Market,
    there are many other aspects which we seek to include in the
    economic system.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Spirit: The Ghost in the Machine
     </b>
     . Although most are
    loath to admit it, even stockbrokers are a bit superstitious.
    The movements of the Market sometimes exhibit surprisingly
    complex and flexible behaviors, almost like living beings.
    These patterns can be controlled, analysed or eliminated by
    applying correct business procedures against them.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Time: Speed and Statistics
     </b>
     . Time is literally money.
    All truly successful businessmen have been quick to act and
    good at foreseeing future events. To achieve this we use
    statistics to find the patterns in past events and extrapolate
    future trends. We also study means to work faster and more
    efficient and to speed up (or slow down) the changes on the
    Market.
    </li>
   </ul>

   <b>
    Business Sense
   </b>
   . To fully be able to
  understand the Market, one has to have an intuitive business
  acumen. Successful businessmen all seem to know almost directly
  what the Market will do in a certain situation, and can
  manipulate it at will. The most successful are so close to it
  that they always acts in the best way possible, and skilfully
  avoid any imperfections.

   <b>
    The Invisible Hand
   </b>
   . Just like the Market
  balances and guides itself towards optimality, all people also
  moves towards perfection. This phenomenon, usually called the
  Invisible Hand, can be more or less effective depending on
  various factors like market interference, intuition and person.
   <h2>
    Quintessence
   </h2>
   <b>
    Capital
   </b>
   . Everything that exists must
  have capital to exist, and most processes require a steady inflow
  to survive. It is naturally vitally important for us to keep
  track of these flows to keep the market stable, and through them
  we can control everything else if needed. Surplus capital should
  naturally be invested in profitable ventures.
   <h2>
    Paradox
   </h2>
   <b>
    Market Imperfections
   </b>
   . When someone
  interferes with the workings of the Market, this can result in
  Market Imperfections, where the normal rules break down. Such
  instabilities breed insecurity and confusion, and are usually
  destructive.
   <h2>
    Mage-specific Backgrounds
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <b>
      Arcane: Untraceability
     </b>
     . Information is power, and
    the less information anybody has about you and your
    investments, the less power they have over you or your
    transactions.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Destiny: Trainee Promise
     </b>
     . There are some trainees
    who rise meteorically towards the top, overcoming all hinders
    and challenges. Others just plod along with no hope for
    advancement.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Dream: Information
     </b>
     . To be able to work efficiently,
    many people in the business have assistants, staff or
    information networks providing them with relevant information
    and advice. In fact, many are so well-informed that they seem
    to know virtually anything.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>
      Node: Income
     </b>
     . There are many sources of Capital, but
    some income sources seems to produce much more than others.
    These should of course be carefully managed, and it is best to
    make sure the source grows by investing in it.
