Subject: Submission for your Mage page

Hi Anders,

I just came across your MtA page, and I enjoy it quite
a lot.  I am writing to give you the only original
piece of equipment that I have ever made for this game.

I have a Euthanatos charater whom I have been playing
for some time now.  She has just finished this talisman
(the was part of her quest to raise her Arete).  It is
a sniper rifle that is very useful.  All of the powers
that are part of the talisman are rotes that I had
developed over the years with the coincidental effect
that I had bullets fired from a gun.  Then I got to
thinking how much better it would be to just make a
talisman...

Anyway, your page is great, and here's my talisman:

>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<
Sniper's Rifle Talisman (as per BoS Talisman Creation Guide)

Arete: 7
Quintessence: 35 max

It should be noted that it is possible by the rules to shoot
at more than one target per use of this talisman if the range
is short.  Simply declare that you are trying to hit everyone
(3 successes needed) or only selected targets in the vicinity
(4 successes needed).  And a minimum of 4 successes is needed
to hit a single target in line of sight.

The talisman can either sound like a Rifle or be quiet.  It
is perfectly reasonable to have a silenced sniper rifle.

All of the powers of this talisman are coincidental.  It's a
gun.


Powers: (rotes)

1) Folding/Unfolding:

Spheres:
Matter 3

Difficulty: 6
Duration: as per table
Range: N/A
Damage: N/A

Effect: This Matter effect allows the weapon to be folded and
unfolded so that it may be stored/transported without looking
like a weapon.  (Write's note: It may take some getting used
to, but it works out best if the 'natural' form of the rifle
is its 'Folded' shape.  Because the duration of the effect is
based upon the number of successes rolled, it seems the more
intelligent choice is to have the weapon primarily folded.)
  It is also suggested that the person making the talisman
decide what the primary shape is.  If the maker is not going
to be the owner/user, then maybe give that person some say in
the matter.


2) Scope:

Spheres:
Correspondence  2
Forces          1

Difficulty: 5
Duration: as per table
Range: Special
Damage: N/A

Effect:  The scope allows line of sight to be drawn at great distances.
While the level of the effect could conceivably allow sensing at any
point on Earth, I feel that a good house rule is that this power should
be limited to the classic definition of a rifle scope with respect to
Line-of Sight.  The exception to this is the Forces 1 effect allows
the scope to function in any part of the EM spectrum, so, using X-rays
or IR, it is possible to see into buildings, through walls etc. GM's
discretion on just how far to let this go.


3) Incendiary Round:

Spheres:
Entropy 1
Matter  3
Forces  3
Prime   2

Difficulty: 6
Duration: Instantaneous + Fire
Range: Line of Sight (see Scope)
Damage: 5 x Successes (Aggrivated + Fire)

Effect: The Undead can be pesky critters unless one deals with them in
a convincing manner.  That's why this incendiary round was developed.
  The Entropy effect gives targeting information to the eyepiece of the
scope about the weakest part of the vampire (ala Dim Mak).  When fired,
the round rips into the target and shreds its pattern (Matter effect).
At the same time, the target bursts into flames (Forces 3, Prime 2) and
burns. (Technically, the fire will get its duration from the duration
effects table in the rule book, but let common sense prevail, please)
  This round was originally designed for use against Vampires, but it
was later found to be very effect when used against doors, people's
clothes (especially body armor), and vehicular gas tanks(ouch).
  This round is also an arsonist's/pyromaniac's dream.  It leaves no
residual evidence.  Imagine a terrorist shooting from a hilltop, miles
away, at an oil refinery's storage tanks...  Not a pretty picture.


4) Anti-Personnel Round:

Spheres:
Entropy 1
Life    4
Matter  3

Difficulty: 7
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: Line of Sight (see Scope)
Damage: 5 x Successes (Aggrivated)

Effect:  Imagine getting hit in the head with a wad of bubble gum
travelling at Mach 3.5. That's what this round does to a target.
It is equally effective against living and nonliving targets, but
it is used mainly on living targets due to the higher difficulty.
This round is also used on nonliving targets when the use of the
incendiary round is impractical.
  As with the incendiary round, the Entropy effect gives target
data to the mage through the scope.

5) Silver Bullet:

Spheres:
Entropy 1
Matter  2
Forces  3
Prime   2

Difficulty: 6 (also requires a separate Firearms 'To Hit' roll)
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: Line of Sight (see Scope)
Damage: 5 x Successes (Aggrivated vs Werewolves)

Effect: While werewolves are able to very effectively resist the Anti-
Personnel Round, they have a much nastier time with this little gem.
  The Matter effect creates a silver bullet and it is propelled toward
the target by the Forces/Prime effect.  The Firearms skill roll will
determine if the silver bullet hits its mark.
  Again, the Entropy effect finds the target's weaker regions.

Well, I hope you enjoy it.

Take care,
