   Many of the denizens of the Umbra trod the Earth in ancient
  times. They were known as monsters or mythological beings, and
  many of them still live on in old myths. Before the material and
  spiritual planes were forces apart, there were less difference
  between them, and the distinction between umbrood and earthly
  beings was vague. Today all beings living in the world are
  chained by Paradox and Static Reality, but many of the old beings
  still exist in an umbral exile and yearn for a return to the old
  times.
   <p>
    When the gauntlet formed, the Mythologae were forced to choose
  between exile and to submit to a new, harsher reality. Most fled
  or gradually vanished, but a few remained. They had to adapt to
  survive, or simply give up and become figments of the
  imagination.
   </p>
   <p>
    Many Mythologae seems to be at least partially shaped or
  empowered by the belief of sleepers. When people stopped seeing
  visions of angels and demons, they started to be contacted by
  spiritistic presences and later UFOs, fulfilling the same
  spiritual need of guidance and mystery. In fact, many of the
    <em>
     aliens
    </em>
    seems to behave like beings which once manifested
  to the medieval peasants as angels or faeries. One school of
  thought say that our perceptions of the beings have changed,
  while the essential beings has remained. Others claim that new
  beings emerge from the Umbra to fulfil our fantasies.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Mythologae are extremely varied beings, ranging from
  strange animals to the mighty dragons. Unlike most spirits they
  usually don't change their forms very much, and can often be
  identified into various genera. However, just like in all other
  matters of the Umbra appearances can be deceiving. Their tendency
  towards embodiment both helps and hinders their summoning. Since
  they often have strong ties to the material world they usually
  answer summonings much more readily than they aetheric brethren.
  Unfortunately they also require bodies, and since many of them
  lack the ability to form their own bodies, the mage have to
  provide it. This can of course be problematic in the case of the
  more bizarre mythologae.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Sea-Serpents
   </h3>
   The Sea-Serpents are powerful beings
  apparently not related to the dragons. Their classic form is a
  huge serpent/fish hybrid, sometimes with saurian features. They
  usually appear in regions of the ocean where static reality is
  not strong enough, possibly swimming in from the Umbra. Their
  general behavior varies, most seem to ignore humans unless
  provoked, but when angered they are terribly destructive beings.
  Some Sea-Serpents have taken residence in lakes on strong
  ley-lines, like Loch Ness. Apparently they survive despite the
  surrounding harsh reality due to the surplus of Quintessence.
  Most serpents seen are apparently adults, and often quite a match
  for an Adept.
   <h3>
    Chimerae
   </h3>
   One type of mythologae often associated with
  Marauders are the chimerae. These beings are composites of
  different animals or even humans. The classical chimera had a
  fire-breathing lions head, a goat head on the body and a snake as
  tail. Other classical forms are the centaurs, manticoras,
  basilisks, sphinxes and harpies, just to name a few. As a general
  rule, these beings are very disharmonic and tend to be violent
  and predatory. There are some speculation that the Marauders
  actively create these beings in the Umbra or in realms they
  control, possibly to prepare for a large scale intrusion or just
  for fun.
   <p>
    Most chimerae are minions, usually with very animalistic
  tendencies. The classical types are more powerful than the rest,
  and often have a power of 2 or even 3. Most powers are physical,
  like powerful venom, fire breathing or the ability to fly. Some
  chimerae are more or less intelligent, especially those with
  human parts like centaurs and sphinxes, but usually tend to fall
  prey to their animal passions when pressed. They have a power of
  3 or even 4 in some individual cases.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Modern beings
   </h3>
   Some mythologae belong to the modern world.
  Most exist in remote places or the Umbra, and make short
  incursions to feed on reality or live out their existence. Due to
  paradox, their preference for places with low gauntlets and the
  cover of the Technocracy, these beings are always very hard to
  document in any way, and can often be dismissed as visual
  illusions or exaggerations.
   <p>
    The most typical modern mythologae are the UFOs and their
  beings. There are a staggering variety of ufonauts, and most are
  completely incomprehensible. They usually appear to isolated
  people, subject them to a confusing and contradictory experience,
  and then disappear. Sometimes they leave behind inscrutable
  artefacts like pieces of metals, complex mutilations, crop
  circles or even gifts of food. Some mages believe they are a
  modern form of faeries, while others believe they represent
  beings from the Realm of Mystery.
   </p>
   <p>
    Other modern mythologae are found in urban folklore, like
  sewer crocodiles, predatory insects, poltergeists or serial
  killers. They are usually not very strong beings, and disappear
  as soon as disbelievers approaches to avoid Paradox.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Great Animals
   </h3>
   The Great Animals are the leaders of their
  kind, usually very big and smart animals, often with some
  distinguishing marks. Typical examples are the wolvens, the White
  Whale, the Lion King or the Great Buffalo. Most of the lower
  animals are not intelligent, but often exhibit great cunning and
  physical power. The higher Great Animals are often intelligent
  and quite powerful. All great Animals have dominion over the
  lesser individuals of their species, and some are surrounded by
  flocks or courts of their own. They often take great interest in
  the welfare of their underlings, and will not take kindly to
  anyone hurting them.
   <p>
    Great Animals are closely related to the Totem Animals, and
  may be the same. If a mage (or sleeper) impresses them for some
  reason, they can adopt him. As long as he follows and respects
  the animal, he will be protected, guided and taught by his Totem.
  In fact, there is a strong overlap between the Great Animals and
  other nature spirits.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Dragons
   </h3>
   The Dragons are the most powerful of the
  Mythologae, the personifications of pure Power and Force. They
  are noble beings, often wielders of great magick and enormous
  physical power. The main difference is between the Great Dragons
  and the lesser Wyrms, which are often not very intelligent and
  usually destructive, greedy beings. According to some theories,
  the dragons do not evolve from matter towards spirit, but from
  spirit towards matter. This could explain the difference between
  the Great Dragons and the lesser ones.
   <p>
    Another division is cultural, between the western and eastern
  dragons. Western dragons tend towards more physical existence,
  often with a bulky, definite lizard-shape and an intense hunger
  for material wealth and food. Eastern dragons are more elemental,
  and often have less defined forms. Instead they appear to enjoy
  political and magickal power more, and often surround themselves
  with courts of lesser beings in great palaces in their home
  realms, while western dragons are generally solitary and prefer
  natural caves. Eastern dragons also appear to take less interest
  in the material world, while western dragons often seek to breach
  the Gauntlet.
   </p>
   <p>
    Most dragons can easily defeat even a Master in magick, and
  are roughly equivalent to a Lord or Greater Preceptor. Beside
  magicks such as Forces, they are often quite powerful in Mind and
  Spirit, not to mention numerous other spheres. Their physical
  abilities are no less impressive, and many are invulnerable to
  ordinary weapons. However, their greatest strength is spiritual.
  The dragon mind is alien and more dangerous than any magick. Its
  sharp as a razor, practically impossible to befuddle, and when it
  strikes it strikes like a cobra. Many dragons dominate people
  simply by their sheer presence or their titanic will.
